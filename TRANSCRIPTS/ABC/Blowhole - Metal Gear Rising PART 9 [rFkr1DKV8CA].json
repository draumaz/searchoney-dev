["01:55,980","02:01,380","\"I typed in naked ladies calm and I saw naked ladies and I thought that was so funny\""]
["02:01,380","02:05,700","\"And then I like told my parents about it at dinner and they screamed at me\""]
["02:05,700","02:09,500","\"I will say the first time I ever saw hentai\""]
["02:09,500","02:16,100","\"I thought it was like just completely a joke like I saw this image of like misty sucking ashes dick\""]

["03:01,420","03:04,480","\"It is really funny that movie because the dub is ridiculous\""]
["03:04,480","03:10,220","\"But my mom bought that for me because I had a big cool monster on the cover and she was like Chris loves be cool monsters\""]
["03:11,100","03:18,320","\"Did so did she ever find out about that? No, but I think they watch every few videos on here, so she'll find out now\""]

["03:47,000","03:53,940","\"If you put a clap sing symbol emoji between every letter than maybe yeah if every letter has a clap\""]
["03:53,940","03:59,880","\"The more clap emojis you can condense into a statement the more it makes sense. That's the point of Hideo Kojima is\""]
["03:59,880","04:06,240","\"That is idioms and memes. Yeah, I think so. That's like the whole point of Metal Gear Solid 2, right?\""]
["04:06,240","04:11,040","\"Is that hideous hideous right yeah, it's the hideo is one letter away from video\""]
["04:11,040","04:15,560","\"Yeah, and he said he'd you'll make this video deal and then you're supposed to take that from it\""]

["04:34,120","04:37,180","\"Okay, it's when psychomattice turns off your TV. It says hideo at the top\""]
["04:37,180","04:42,180","\"I see and every single person that sign was like um it's spelled video actually\""]
["04:42,180","04:47,260","\"Because at the time no, I know who hideo kojima was they just knew metal gear\""]
["04:47,260","04:53,920","\"Hideo that's how you pronounce our he'dio is it he'dio he'dio he'dio no it's he'dio\""]
["04:53,920","04:58,760","\"I think it's he'dio. It's he'dio cuz the E would be pronounced it\""]
["04:58,760","05:01,280","\"That's how Japanese is transliterated\""]
["05:03,200","05:06,040","\"- Hey, please continue to argue about this this whole time.\""]
["05:06,040","05:07,840","\"I want a resolution by the time I'm back.\""]
["05:07,840","05:09,800","\"- You need the old code, you're not gonna blast it.\""]
["05:09,800","05:12,760","\"- You sent it like a real frickin' guy there.\""]
["05:12,760","05:14,200","\"- I am a real guy.\""]
["05:14,200","05:16,480","\"- You sent it like a real human being.\""]
["05:16,480","05:18,680","\"- Oh yeah, since Lyle's playing him leaving means\""]
["05:18,680","05:20,760","\"we're just dead in the water.\""]
["05:20,760","05:23,280","\"- We can talk about him until he gets back.\""]
["05:23,280","05:24,520","\"Okay, call him a bag.\""]
["05:24,520","05:27,640","\"- I mean, it's just really mean.\""]
["05:27,640","05:29,920","\"It implies that he's old and wrinkly.\""]
["05:29,920","05:31,680","\"- And he's full of either nothing.\""]
["05:31,680","05:33,200","\"- Who'd hurt his feelings a lot.\""]
["05:33,200","05:34,680","\"- He's full of stuff.\""]
["05:34,680","05:35,800","\"He sinks when you put him down.\""]
["05:35,800","05:37,200","\"- Not all bags are full of stuff.\""]
["05:37,200","05:38,920","\"Some bags are empty.\""]
["05:38,920","05:41,520","\"- My bags from school had rotting bananas\""]
["05:41,520","05:42,960","\"at the bottom of them.\""]
["05:42,960","05:44,720","\"- Was that really a thing that happened here?\""]
["05:44,720","05:47,040","\"- Yeah, my mom would always pack me a banana in a sandwich\""]
["05:47,040","05:48,480","\"and I put it in my bag full of bucks\""]
["05:48,480","05:50,280","\"and it would all get super smushed\""]
["05:50,280","05:52,760","\"and sometimes it would just squish into the bottom.\""]
["05:52,760","05:55,960","\"So a lot of my bucks just had bananas in the pages.\""]
["05:55,960","05:56,800","\"- Ew.\""]
["05:56,800","06:00,600","\"- Did I ever tell you about the Wendy's burger?\""]
["06:00,600","06:01,800","\"- No.\""]
["06:01,800","06:03,320","\"- There was just this weird smell\""]
["06:03,320","06:04,880","\"that had been growing over the course\""]
["06:04,880","06:08,280","\"of a year in my voice booth closet.\""]
["06:08,280","06:09,120","\"- Ew.\""]
["06:09,120","06:12,920","\"- Wait, you brought a burger into God's house?\""]
["06:12,920","06:14,640","\"- And it was voice booth.\""]
["06:14,640","06:18,120","\"- So what it was, it was a burger that I had bought.\""]
["06:18,120","06:19,600","\"It was an extra burger I had,\""]
["06:19,600","06:21,640","\"and I stashed it in my briefcase.\""]
["06:21,640","06:23,240","\"I never use a briefcase.\""]
["06:23,240","06:24,880","\"I just had it that day\""]
["06:24,880","06:27,560","\"'cause I was carrying something around with me.\""]
["06:27,560","06:29,720","\"And so I said it back in the closet\""]
["06:29,720","06:31,680","\"and didn't touch it again for over a year.\""]
["06:31,680","06:35,000","\"And there was just like a cheap Wendy's burger sitting\""]
["06:35,000","06:37,680","\"in there the whole time, like slowly rotting.\""]
["06:37,680","06:39,240","\"- That sucks.\""]
["06:39,240","06:42,240","\"I did that with, it wasn't a full burger,\""]
["06:42,240","06:45,280","\"but I like drove through like an in and out or something.\""]
["06:45,280","06:47,120","\"And when I was, since I was driving,\""]
["06:47,120","06:49,040","\"like when I was done eating it,\""]
["06:49,040","06:52,160","\"I just smashed it into not really a glove compartment,\""]
["06:52,160","06:54,960","\"just like a space underneath my stereo.\""]
["06:54,960","06:59,680","\"And there it remained for like four months.\""]
["06:59,680","07:02,020","\"Until I was like, what the fuck stinks in my car?\""]
["07:02,020","07:03,260","\"And then yeah, it was that.\""]
["07:03,260","07:07,700","\"- It is satisfying to find the true source of a bad smell.\""]
["07:07,700","07:09,420","\"- The true stink of the source.\""]
["07:09,420","07:10,760","\"- Instead of having to just be like,\""]
["07:10,760","07:12,380","\"oh, I guess it just smells.\""]
["07:12,380","07:15,340","\"- Maybe, but wouldn't it suck if you fucking tore apart\""]
["07:15,340","07:16,940","\"like your drywall or something?\""]
["07:16,940","07:20,260","\"- Like, I feel like that's happened to a lot of people.\""]
["07:20,260","07:23,220","\"They just lose a little piece of food somewhere.\""]
["07:23,220","07:26,220","\"- It turns out it was all coming from your neighbor's\""]
["07:26,220","07:28,420","\"place all along or something.\""]
["07:28,420","07:30,420","\"Yeah, you stinky fucking neighbors.\""]
["07:30,420","07:36,120","\"No, the worst was like, I used to live in this fucking nightmare house that was like,\""]
["07:36,120","07:40,420","\"it used to be an auto shop, but the guy fucking converted it into a duplex.\""]
["07:40,420","07:48,120","\"And, uh, we just had such a fucking bad rat problem that like, by the time I left that place, like, reeked of death.\""]
["07:48,120","07:51,720","\"It's like it was fun, they would just get in the walls and like shit and die.\""]
["07:51,720","07:55,420","\"It was bad, man. Like, it got real bad.\""]
["07:56,020","07:59,620","\"Because it was in the walls, it's like you can't really do anything about that.\""]
["07:59,620","08:06,020","\"I remember being a kid and playing some old like CD-ROM Lego game for Windows.\""]
["08:06,020","08:07,020","\"It was a Lego Island?\""]
["08:07,020","08:08,520","\"Yeah, Lego Island.\""]
["08:08,520","08:11,020","\"It was a song called \"\"Brick by Brick\"\", yeah.\""]
["08:11,020","08:14,020","\"That game looks ridiculous.\""]
["08:14,020","08:17,020","\"God, this fucking guy took forever to kill.\""]
["08:17,020","08:18,020","\"Well, you did it.\""]
["08:18,020","08:19,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:19,020","08:22,020","\"I'm not gonna stop doing it either. Fuck you, dude.\""]
["08:24,020","08:30,820","\"I'm so proud of you you've come so far ever since the accident. He's truly minced. Yeah, that's so fucking satisfying\""]
["08:30,820","08:36,060","\"You've talked about like how you were unclogging the toilet, right?\""]
["08:36,060","08:40,120","\"And I waffle stomped you waffle stomped it down\""]
["08:40,120","08:45,100","\"You broke the toilet you slipped on the waffle. What's the term waffle stop?\""]
["08:45,100","08:47,600","\"You smudge shit down a drain with your foot. Oh\""]
["08:47,600","08:52,160","\"Yeah, like you know like the great on like the the drain of your shower\""]
["08:52,160","08:59,420","\"Oh, I see I thought it was just because of like the shape of like the bottom of a shoe that it's the most perfect description for that exact thing\""]
["08:59,420","09:06,020","\"Yeah, it's pretty good. Whoever came up with it as a genius. Yeah, and now everyone's gonna steal it from him\""]
["09:06,020","09:14,620","\"Including us. Yeah, we just did. Oh, no, yeah, this is exactly what you were talking about become the evil this looks like Traverse Town\""]
["09:14,620","09:17,360","\"it is\""]
["09:17,360","09:19,360","\"Sing the song to Omar, please\""]
["09:19,520","09:23,900","\"The traverse town song. Yeah, how's it go?\""]
["09:23,900","09:29,100","\"Remember\""]
["09:29,100","09:38,380","\"It's a good song even though it's really annoying I've definitely heard it for many many hours\""]
["09:38,380","09:42,360","\"Yes, it's one of those things where it's like the first time you hear it\""]
["09:42,360","09:47,360","\"You're like that's pleasant and then the nine thousandth time you heard it. You're like I hate this\""]
["09:48,060","09:54,420","\"That was like my biggest thing with near automata is that that game never shuts the fuck up and it has like four songs\""]
["09:54,420","10:01,860","\"By the end of it. You're just like oh stop one thing that ruins a lot of media for me is when they just shove music in when it's not\""]
["10:01,860","10:03,660","\"Needed it all\""]
["10:03,660","10:09,380","\"Yeah, that that game has like it has like an overworld theme that has vocals in it\""]
["10:09,380","10:14,060","\"Yeah, so you just hear it like over and over and over again. That's annoying. I\""]
["10:15,340","10:20,540","\"I will say that persona has a lot of that, but it never really wore down on me because they're really...\""]
["10:20,540","10:23,040","\"I don't know, it's just because they're good songs.\""]
["10:23,040","10:32,840","\"I haven't played the new person, but I tried to play in person 3, and that game reset the same track every time you went through a loading screen.\""]
["10:32,840","10:36,940","\"So I heard the beginning of that song like, \"\"I fucked that up!\"\"\""]
["10:36,940","10:41,840","\"I only played like persona 3 for like an hour 12 years ago.\""]
["10:42,840","10:46,840","\"Me too, and I still remember being so annoyed with that that it stuck with me.\""]
["10:46,840","10:52,440","\"But maybe that's just me being autistic because I hate hearing like repetitive things.\""]
["10:52,440","10:57,960","\"I definitely played it for more than an hour, but I just remember like when I came to at least the assumption that like,\""]
["10:57,960","11:02,920","\"\"\"Am I really just gonna keep going back into the same dungeon over and over again for the entire game?\"\"\""]
["11:02,920","11:04,520","\"Oh shit.\""]
["11:04,520","11:07,400","\"Which I don't even know if that's the case, but that's what I thought at the time.\""]
["11:07,400","11:08,840","\"What did I just do?\""]
["11:08,840","11:10,520","\"Help me, I'll be one could I be?\""]
["11:10,520","11:13,120","\"Yeah, you threw down a little Princess Leia hologram.\""]
["11:13,120","11:17,720","\"Oh, that's like, uh, that's probably like the uh, Nootie Mag and uh, Metal Gear Solid.\""]
["11:17,720","11:18,220","\"Ooh.\""]
["11:18,220","11:18,720","\"That's supposed to catch-\""]
["11:18,720","11:20,520","\"Ah, that didn't fucking work at all.\""]
["11:20,520","11:21,420","\"I really tried-\""]
["11:21,420","11:22,220","\"Wait a minute!\""]
["11:22,220","11:23,220","\"The walking bar!\""]
["11:23,220","11:24,020","\"Let's walk it!\""]
["11:24,020","11:27,320","\"It's okay, we know this isn't really a Metal Gear game anyway.\""]
["11:27,320","11:29,320","\"Yeah, I guess that's not the appeal of it.\""]
["11:29,320","11:31,120","\"But it could have been.\""]
["11:31,120","11:35,020","\"I think like Star Wars is the greatest experiment of all time.\""]
["11:35,020","11:36,320","\"What about it?\""]
["11:36,320","11:37,920","\"Just the entire franchise?\""]
["11:37,920","11:38,720","\"Just like...\""]
["11:39,420","11:43,420","\"How much can we spend on this thing and still make it as shit as possible?\""]
["11:43,420","11:46,420","\"I'm actually talking about just Disney Store?\""]
