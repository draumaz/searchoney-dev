["01:25,020","01:27,420","\"Oh, it's Martini Mario.\""]
["01:27,420","01:29,420","\"Oh, I was just kidding.\""]
["01:29,420","01:31,420","\"They didn't get that guy from, but they should.\""]
["01:31,420","01:33,380","\"They got someone weird to voice Luigi.\""]

["01:36,660","01:37,660","\"All right, all right.\""]
["01:37,660","01:40,300","\"It's just some celebrity who some producer\""]
["01:40,300","01:42,660","\"wanted to make friends with.\""]
["01:42,660","01:44,580","\"Yeah, I think it might be Joseph Gordon Levitt.\""]
["01:44,580","01:47,020","\"I'm not sure.\""]
["01:47,020","01:49,140","\"Joseph Gordon, Luigi.\""]

["01:54,980","02:03,120","\"Oh, oh, what's Bowser's deal today? Oh, he's just being a real piece of shit. Oh, I guess I go down here. Okay\""]
["02:03,120","02:06,400","\"Thank you coins. I would have known otherwise\""]
["02:06,400","02:09,680","\"Wow, he's fucking huge\""]

["02:21,360","02:24,040","\"Why'd better you say brickle berry?\""]
["02:24,040","02:26,040","\"What is this?\""]
["02:26,040","02:28,800","\"What's he doing?\""]
["02:28,800","02:35,920","\"It's just being a dick. Oh, maybe maybe it was just rumors. Uh-oh. I could have sworn it was like Joseph Gordon Levitt or something was\""]
["02:35,920","02:40,760","\"voicing Luigi. I wish it was Joseph Gordon Levitt. I wish Zoe the Chanel voice Mario.\""]
["02:40,760","02:44,680","\"Did you look it up? I looked it up. I couldn't find anything\""]
["02:44,680","02:50,600","\"I might have just fucking heard some stupid rumor and believed it was true. Yeah, no Joseph Gordon Levitt's gonna be tales\""]
["02:50,600","02:58,400","\"That's what you're thinking of. Oh, yeah, it's tails and Sonic - that hurts. Oh, you finally heard him\""]
["02:58,400","03:04,680","\"That's how you can be you just taking tiny dips out of his health bar\""]
["03:04,680","03:11,520","\"So from what I've heard this whole game is like one big open level really yeah, that's a cool little sprite\""]
["03:11,520","03:17,560","\"There he is man, that's so lazy, but it looks very fluid\""]
["03:20,200","03:21,800","\"Imagine if that was you.\""]
["03:21,800","03:23,920","\"If you saw a picture of that, someone showed you that\""]
["03:23,920","03:26,160","\"and was like, \"\"Look at yourself.\"\"\""]
["03:26,160","03:27,880","\"- Well, you mean Bowser?\""]
["03:27,880","03:28,720","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:28,720","03:33,080","\"Like if you were in a really, really bad mood\""]
["03:33,080","03:35,600","\"and someone took a picture of you and showed you it\""]
["03:35,600","03:37,080","\"and it looked like that and they were like,\""]
["03:37,080","03:39,280","\"\"\"Do you realize this is what you look like\""]
["03:39,280","03:41,720","\"\"\"to other people when you do this?\"\"\""]
["03:41,720","03:42,560","\"- I would just be like,\""]
["03:42,560","03:44,760","\"\"\"What, I would say the same thing I'm saying right now.\""]
["03:44,760","03:47,160","\"\"\"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\"\""]
["03:47,160","03:48,920","\"Look, like-- - Go inside the lighthouse.\""]
["03:48,920","03:49,920","\"- This is a weird thing.\""]
["03:49,920","03:52,640","\"Yeah, if I try walking slowly, he's still like does that.\""]
["03:52,640","03:53,880","\"But if you walk quickly.\""]
["03:53,880","03:54,680","\"Wheee!\""]
["03:54,680","03:55,840","\"Yeah, I noticed that.\""]
["03:55,840","03:57,200","\"I'm going.\""]
["03:57,200","03:58,600","\"I'm going.\""]
["03:58,600","04:01,640","\"He doesn't really have like a slow walk animation.\""]
["04:01,640","04:03,120","\"Well.\""]
["04:03,120","04:06,320","\"Oh, this is very peaceful.\""]
["04:06,320","04:07,320","\"Sure is.\""]
["04:07,320","04:09,400","\"It makes me think of better times.\""]
["04:09,400","04:11,560","\"Help!\""]
["04:11,560","04:13,920","\"Fucking kill me.\""]
["04:13,920","04:16,160","\"Put me out of my misery.\""]
["04:18,640","04:22,400","\"He's actually crying. What's wrong with him? He's fucking peeved dude\""]
["04:22,400","04:28,440","\"So wait, can one of you guys join in or is this actually more of like Mario 64 type game?\""]
["04:28,440","04:34,040","\"I think you've got to go talk to fucking baby Bowser there. Oh, I see\""]
["04:34,040","04:38,640","\"I think baby Bowser is my favorite Mario character\""]
["04:38,640","04:42,560","\"Everyone loves him you my dad's a fuck head\""]
["04:42,560","04:48,040","\"That's not a good picture and now it's better. Oh wow. He's black facing him\""]
["04:48,040","04:58,400","\"Oh my god. Yeah I fucking noticed that already. Yeah no shit. Mario dad is out of control.\""]
["04:58,400","05:02,140","\"I don't know what happened. Wait why didn't he just talk in the first place then?\""]
["05:02,140","05:10,780","\"Mario this is like you punk ass. I don't trust this kid. He's too big and mad. I can't\""]
["05:10,780","05:20,460","\"change dad back by myself. He's been corrupted by the Mario's cynical. I never\""]
["05:20,460","05:27,460","\"ask you for help ever ever. Don't do anything to save Piappa. So help me. I see\""]
["05:27,460","05:36,900","\"you got empathy you're on my side. He's good now. His brush turned from black to\""]
["05:36,900","05:47,940","\"some sort of neon thing. Put a little. How much help? None. Alrighty. Alrighty. It's been done.\""]
["05:47,940","06:00,340","\"This is the best thing you could possibly do. In my realm. My own. Oh how'd you become little so\""]
["06:00,340","06:01,340","\"fast.\""]
["06:01,340","06:03,700","\"Like fucking fell into black paint.\""]
["06:03,700","06:05,140","\"You can't do that.\""]
["06:05,140","06:07,820","\"That you Bowser Jr. probably sat down.\""]
["06:07,820","06:11,380","\"Did you see the new horrible smash reveal that everyone literally fucking hated?\""]
["06:11,380","06:12,380","\"What was it?\""]
["06:12,380","06:14,180","\"It was a fucking Xenoblade character.\""]
["06:14,180","06:15,180","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["06:15,180","06:16,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:16,180","06:20,860","\"Like literally nobody outside of Japan would ever care about a new Xenoblade character.\""]
["06:20,860","06:24,220","\"I don't know if anybody inside of Japan necessarily does.\""]
["06:24,220","06:25,220","\"It's hard to say.\""]
["06:25,220","06:28,740","\"It feels sometimes like it's just for the ego of the guys that have created these more\""]
["06:28,740","06:33,500","\"new games and they're like, well, we're first party Nintendo, so uh, it's probably, and\""]
["06:33,500","06:37,460","\"we're here at the office and so you should probably appreciate our characters more.\""]
["06:37,460","06:39,780","\"It's like nobody cares about Xenoblade.\""]
["06:39,780","06:44,060","\"I mean, I think it's just integrated advertising really is going on here.\""]
["06:44,060","06:46,780","\"That's the most simple explanation for it.\""]
["06:46,780","06:53,380","\"My problem with Xenoblade, like I get the appeal, like I like those kinds of games,\""]
["06:53,380","06:58,540","\"like the big action RPGs, like the open world action RPGs, but something about Xenoblade\""]
["06:58,540","07:00,140","\"is never quite clicked with me.\""]
["07:00,140","07:02,460","\"Where like I never really care about the world\""]
["07:02,460","07:03,940","\"or the characters.\""]
["07:03,940","07:06,820","\"- Have you seen like the actual reveal for it?\""]
["07:06,820","07:07,660","\"- No.\""]
["07:07,660","07:09,100","\"- It just seemed like really, really lazy.\""]
["07:09,100","07:10,820","\"Like it was the most like--\""]
["07:10,820","07:12,460","\"- Shared with Sephiroth in the shower.\""]
["07:12,460","07:14,740","\"- Yeah, like that was the best fucking reveal ever.\""]
["07:14,740","07:15,580","\"And then right after that,\""]
["07:15,580","07:17,220","\"it's like the worst fucking reveal ever.\""]
["07:17,220","07:18,100","\"It's just really weird.\""]
["07:18,100","07:20,460","\"- Maybe that's why they picked Now to Do It.\""]
["07:20,460","07:22,660","\"'Cause everyone was feeling so good about Sephiroth\""]
["07:22,660","07:25,300","\"still though like we could really get away with anything.\""]
["07:25,300","07:26,140","\"- Probably right.\""]
["07:26,140","07:27,940","\"- So let's take our week as character.\""]
["07:27,940","07:29,860","\"we had left to reveal and do it now.\""]
["07:29,860","07:32,260","\"- Yeah, Sephiroth seemed like a preemptive apology.\""]
["07:32,260","07:33,700","\"- Yeah. (laughs)\""]
["07:33,700","07:34,940","\"- You're right.\""]
["07:34,940","07:37,140","\"- 'Cause you already are willing to forgive them\""]
["07:37,140","07:38,140","\"because of Sephiroth, right?\""]
["07:38,140","07:39,820","\"- Yeah, I knew there was no way\""]
["07:39,820","07:41,940","\"that it was gonna be two good ones in a row.\""]
["07:41,940","07:44,020","\"It was just not gonna happen.\""]
["07:44,020","07:46,740","\"- Yeah, I guess this game is more of like a,\""]
["07:46,740","07:51,540","\"it's like almost a throwback to Mario Sunshine,\""]
["07:51,540","07:54,780","\"you know, without any of its core game mechanics.\""]
["07:54,780","07:55,780","\"- That's fine by me.\""]
["07:55,780","07:57,780","\"You like the mung shooter?\""]
["07:57,780","08:03,980","\"I mean, I don't miss it, no, but it's cool for that game, but I wouldn't want it back.\""]
["08:03,980","08:07,380","\"The lighthouse wants to bring something to light.\""]
["08:07,380","08:11,500","\"The spotty goople vanish into the light of a catch shine.\""]
["08:11,500","08:14,660","\"If you can't find one try looking at another island.\""]
["08:14,660","08:15,660","\"Okay.\""]
["08:15,660","08:20,900","\"Does each pile of goop need a certain amount of catch shines?\""]
["08:20,900","08:22,900","\"Uh, yes.\""]
["08:22,900","08:29,780","\"Shine sprites was in terms specifically from I guess I got over there now. Bye. From that Mario, right?\""]
["08:29,780","08:31,780","\"Can I just fly forever? Yeah\""]
["08:31,780","08:36,140","\"Wait, where are you? Oh, okay. I can return to you\""]
["08:36,140","08:44,420","\"Uh-huh. It's a gigabelle. I heard a cool thing about these. I think it was when the beast rises the gigabelle ring or some shit\""]
["08:44,420","08:46,860","\"Maybe we got to get this splotchy goopah\""]
["08:46,860","08:49,180","\"Yeah, okay\""]
["08:49,180","08:51,180","\"We got to go over here\""]
["08:51,300","08:59,120","\"If they did a reveal for smash and it was Mike Matei's gadget it would probably be the coolest thing ever I'd laugh\""]
["08:59,120","09:03,440","\"Mike Matei's inspector gadget\""]
["09:03,440","09:11,020","\"Copyright unenforceable. It would be so funny. They should do that or they should do Homer and Peter Griffin in the same reveal\""]
["09:11,020","09:14,820","\"That would be awesome. I think that would actually hype people to fuck up\""]
["09:18,820","09:25,400","\"I would fucking scream in the light. I'm sick of Nintendo characters. It's always Nintendo obviously\""]
["09:25,400","09:32,120","\"So picking shitty ones. I think that one is a Nintendo character. I think that's the only reason why they know they have not\""]
["09:32,120","09:35,760","\"Created an iconic character in like a decade or two\""]
["09:35,760","09:37,800","\"They should have gotten the metal slug guy\""]
["09:37,800","09:44,240","\"It's like who was the last like all the all the recent iconic Nintendo characters have just been additions to like\""]
["09:44,240","09:46,840","\"Mario or Zelda I\""]
["09:47,280","09:53,460","\"Think they could have gotten Chrono trigger guy. They could have done Eggman. You mean Chrono. Yeah\""]
["09:53,460","10:00,960","\"See our metal Sonic that'd be cool. Yeah, no, I'd rather get an Eggman or a metal Sonic or tails or Knuckles\""]
["10:00,960","10:06,000","\"I mean, I'm still like they won't put tails or Knuckles in cuz they put him in his trophies already\""]
["10:06,000","10:09,040","\"I still think Gino would be a good one\""]
["10:09,040","10:12,360","\"Yeah, no every yeah Gino would be pretty cool\""]
["10:12,360","10:14,580","\"Gino I\""]
["10:14,580","10:22,720","\"Whoa, I know it becomes more obscure the law the further we get from you know the 20 year ago release of Super Mario RPG, but\""]
["10:22,720","10:30,360","\"Nobody would be upset about that. I just can't imagine it. I mean if this were like purely about like the characters\""]
["10:30,360","10:35,120","\"They'd probably put like crash Bandicoot. They really think it crashed would get in. Oh\""]
["10:35,120","10:42,460","\"Like there's some that I would want that I just like there's probably no chance in hell like Master Chief or Kratos or something\""]
["10:42,460","10:48,020","\"like there's no way they would do like Dante would be a good one thought they\""]
["10:48,020","10:52,420","\"would be great fucking I was thinking like couldn't they do at this point\""]
["10:52,420","10:57,840","\"doesn't Microsoft to have like or does Bungie still own the rights to Master\""]
["10:57,840","11:02,620","\"Shield Microsoft does and they put Banjo in which Microsoft also owns the\""]
["11:02,620","11:09,660","\"right and Minecraft yeah so they feasibly could they could do what's his\""]
["11:09,660","11:15,340","\"name. They could. I'm not sure if they would. Yeah. Master Chief. Yeah. Like I know I'm stupid\""]
["11:15,340","11:18,780","\"for wanting that one, but like I want that one. I don't think you're stupid for wanting\""]
["11:18,780","11:24,380","\"that. I think like solid snake is kind of like all alone is like the modern kind of fighter\""]
["11:24,380","11:28,220","\"guy in that game. I don't think it could hurt to have another one. I want to yeah. I want\""]
["11:28,220","11:32,460","\"to see them actually try to tackle a character from a first person shooter. Like I want to\""]
["11:32,460","11:37,420","\"see how they would actually do it because they usually bring in mechanics that kind of like work\""]
["11:37,420","11:39,620","\"with the game that they're bringing the character from.\""]
["11:39,620","11:41,980","\"I would hope they bring the sticky grenade.\""]
["11:41,980","11:43,780","\"I think that would be one of the best things.\""]
["11:43,780","11:45,620","\"Oh yeah, or the Doom guy.\""]
["11:45,620","11:47,340","\"The Doom guy would also be cool.\""]
["11:47,340","11:48,660","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["11:48,660","11:50,620","\"Be a Master Chief, you could definitely make and play\""]
["11:50,620","11:52,660","\"like something between Mega Man and Snake\""]
["11:52,660","11:55,740","\"would be like a good way to do that.\""]
["11:55,740","11:56,700","\"But yeah, I don't know.\""]
["11:56,700","11:57,860","\"That one's stupid.\""]

["25:36,220","25:39,780","\"That's the coincidence. I thought it yeah, I thought it was just a little side zone\""]

["26:27,700","26:35,180","\"I don't know anything about Guy Furia, and I always expect he's like a Tommy Wise Oish kind of character. I know I wouldn't compare with Tommy Wise\""]
