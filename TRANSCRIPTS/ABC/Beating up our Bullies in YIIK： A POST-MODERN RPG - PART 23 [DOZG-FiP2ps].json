["04:44,740","04:48,740","\"At least he's with a sister.\""]
["04:48,740","04:54,740","\"Why do you think it keeps happening that people will make things with huge castle characters\""]
["04:54,740","04:58,740","\"and they want to make a character driven story, but then because there's too many characters,\""]
["04:58,740","05:02,740","\"they start fighting for screen time and certain ones get ignored?\""]
["05:02,740","05:04,740","\"Because you can't have that many characters.\""]
["05:04,740","05:07,740","\"So you can't really manage a script of again one?\""]
["05:07,740","05:13,820","\"So why don't you just make something with fewer characters? It's not just him. It's like other stuff that because I don't think that's the\""]
["05:13,820","05:18,940","\"Way that you think of writing a story. I don't think you're just quantifying the character count\""]
["05:18,940","05:24,740","\"If anything it feels like he's struggling to justify why you even have a party to begin with\""]
["05:24,740","05:31,140","\"Everybody keeps calling each other friends, and it's like you guys literally have not had any connections going here at all\""]

["05:34,140","05:38,140","\"I guess to some degree they keep like everyone shuts each other down\""]
["05:38,140","05:43,320","\"You know what Michael and Rory are the only ones who actually connected at any point\""]
["05:43,320","05:47,580","\"He actually asked him about things and was wondering what his life was like\""]
["05:47,580","05:52,940","\"Yeah, everyone else just like listens to each other and says I don't want to hear any more of that stop\""]
["05:52,940","05:57,060","\"By the way Michael and Rory have been two characters off to the side also\""]
["05:57,060","06:00,000","\"I wasn't pressing a and was making her swing her key\""]
["06:00,000","06:03,500","\"That that minigame is the janky shit ever\""]
["06:03,500","06:06,760","\"I have no idea why it was doing that\""]
["06:06,760","06:15,480","\"What happened he turns you fucking white\""]
["06:15,480","06:22,320","\"He is the mind crush. What would you say the rules are for a protagonist being likable?\""]

["06:28,200","06:33,160","\"That's like, you know everything for all everybody yeah, no like the whole thing about this guys\""]
["06:33,160","06:37,360","\"character is everyone hates me so unlikeable Alex right yeah like everyone who\""]

["06:50,720","06:55,240","\"entertaining I mean that's the thing is you can obviously have moments where you\""]
["06:55,240","06:59,800","\"take pleasure in him being punished for the way that he is yeah and if he\""]
["06:59,800","07:04,680","\"He actually does grow by the end of the game, then it will actually make sense.\""]
["07:04,680","07:05,680","\"But I haven't seen him.\""]
["07:05,680","07:06,680","\"You know what?\""]
["07:06,680","07:08,320","\"He did apologize to Vella.\""]

["07:54,120","07:58,600","\"Is Earthbound actually good? Because I've tried it like 20 times and I can never get into it.\""]
["07:58,600","08:03,960","\"You have to be there for like a lot of the style itself too though.\""]
["08:03,960","08:06,920","\"Because yeah the story isn't much. You're kind of going from place to place.\""]
["08:06,920","08:10,120","\"It's just kind of like a little situation. You almost got it.\""]
["08:10,120","08:10,840","\"You almost got it.\""]

["08:14,360","08:19,160","\"Um I played for like an hour and I just put it down because I'd be walking around the hills\""]
["08:19,160","08:20,120","\"just being like okay.\""]
["08:21,560","08:24,120","\"The beginning of the game takes a little bit grinding.\""]
["08:24,120","08:25,640","\"It's a little bit slow at the start.\""]
["08:25,640","08:27,400","\"But once you start having things move, which is-\""]
["08:27,400","08:29,160","\"-I remember specifically- -Which doesn't take long.\""]
["08:29,160","08:31,480","\"-...having to get some stuff- -...putting grinding if it starts stupid.\""]
["08:31,480","08:33,240","\"-I did it in this too. -Yeah.\""]
["08:33,240","08:37,800","\"Having to do- I remember Frankie Stein being like the first like difficulty spike.\""]
["08:37,800","08:38,760","\"-Frankey Stein.\""]
["08:38,760","08:41,240","\"-But that's very early at the beginning.\""]
["08:41,240","08:43,720","\"Yeah. Once you get past that, things come get easier.\""]
["08:43,720","08:48,440","\"-Check out my- -[laughs]\""]
["08:48,440","08:49,560","\"-What did that happen?\""]

["09:07,120","09:10,600","\"Oh, she messed up. I guess so I like go there\""]
["09:10,600","09:14,920","\"So you said you're not a good singer Chris\""]
["09:15,720","09:21,060","\"Don't know I'm okay. I said you should do a cover of biggering because you really like it\""]
["09:21,060","09:24,720","\"That'll be cool. I can't sing like that guy though. He's got\""]
["09:24,720","09:29,720","\"He can I can only hit really really low notes and I can't really hit very high ones\""]
["09:29,720","09:35,520","\"And you can't like change the key of the song or anything to like fit your vocal range you can but I\""]
["09:35,520","09:39,440","\"Feel like that's cheating. I don't know fair enough you think so\""]
["09:39,440","09:45,120","\"At least no, it's not cheating, but to me it's to myself. It kind of is I don't know. Yeah, I understand that\""]
["09:45,120","09:50,480","\"I yeah setting rules for like your your art is just a thing that people do that\""]
["09:50,480","09:53,440","\"Yeah, he has giving it your own personal flair though if you do it that way\""]
["09:53,440","09:58,680","\"No as opposed to just trying to do it. I mean for one. You're just singing within your vocal range. That's it. I\""]
["09:58,680","10:02,320","\"Mean I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about I\""]
["10:02,320","10:07,280","\"Need trust that you do your music guy your music for the good. I\""]
["10:07,280","10:12,660","\"Mean if you can't physically sing out of your range, then why would you try out? I'm just being stupid\""]
["10:14,320","10:16,320","\"Well, I mean, yeah, there's\""]
["10:16,320","10:22,120","\"Are you shy to sing in front of people? Yeah, yeah, I like singing when no one's listening\""]
["10:22,120","10:26,360","\"But I don't like singing when people are around I would like to I want to oh\""]
["10:26,360","10:32,400","\"I would like to take either singing lessons or just practice on my own. However, you do it\""]
["10:32,400","10:34,760","\"That's what I was gonna ask you is I don't know\""]
["10:34,760","10:36,680","\"Do you know whether or not like you can?\""]
["10:36,680","10:40,160","\"Improve your vocal range is that bio definitely can\""]
["10:40,760","10:44,920","\"You 100% can improve it's literally you're just working at a muscle\""]
["10:44,920","10:50,500","\"And the more you do the the more your vocal range gets bigger. It's weird. That's good then I\""]
["10:50,500","10:58,600","\"Would like to do that someday. I bought a I bought an ad tutorial by by this crazy guy. Hmm. He like oh\""]
["10:58,600","11:04,800","\"Well, he was in some band. He's this guy really long like blonde hair and he was like in an 80s metal band\""]

["11:34,760","11:36,960","\"most entertaining tutorial you'll ever see.\""]
["11:36,960","11:39,520","\"- I'll follow your advice.\""]
["11:39,520","11:43,840","\"- But no, yeah, pretty much if you keep doing the scales\""]
["11:43,840","11:46,760","\"and trying to push yourself a little further,\""]
["11:46,760","11:50,560","\"and what I've learned is that you just can't strain\""]
["11:50,560","11:51,640","\"your voice at all.\""]
["11:51,640","11:53,880","\"If your voice feels in any way in pain,\""]
["11:53,880","11:54,920","\"you're doing it wrong.\""]
["11:54,920","11:55,760","\"- Really?\""]
["11:55,760","11:57,680","\"- Yeah, but if you get to a point\""]
["11:57,680","11:59,800","\"where you're pushing the note and it's coming out\""]
["11:59,800","12:02,040","\"and it's comfortable, if you keep doing it,\""]
["12:02,040","12:03,600","\"the next time you try, you'll probably be able\""]
["12:03,600","12:04,440","\"to go out a little higher.\""]
["12:04,440","12:06,400","\"- That makes sense 'cause it's kind of like body building\""]
["12:06,400","12:09,120","\"that you're not supposed to overwork the muscle.\""]
["12:09,120","12:12,320","\"You're just trying to get like a really efficient\""]
["12:12,320","12:13,400","\"workout out of it.\""]
["12:13,400","12:15,940","\"- It's handy to have a piano that you can\""]

["12:19,760","12:20,600","\"It's always nice.\""]
["12:20,600","12:21,960","\"- I definitely wanna learn music,\""]
["12:21,960","12:24,760","\"but like being an animator takes so much time already.\""]
["12:24,760","12:26,280","\"I respect you for that a lot,\""]
["12:26,280","12:28,600","\"but you've got like a multiple,\""]

["12:32,360","12:34,720","\"You've got multiple disciplines under your belt.\""]
["12:34,720","12:36,720","\"But I completely regret that.\""]
["12:36,720","12:38,000","\"Really do you?\""]
["12:38,000","12:39,000","\"I do.\""]
["12:39,000","12:42,120","\"Do you feel like you're a jack of all trades and a master of none?\""]
["12:42,120","12:43,120","\"Exactly.\""]
["12:43,120","12:48,360","\"If I had a stick to one thing, I could have mastered it by now.\""]
["12:48,360","12:51,920","\"I feel like you're perfectly competent from what I can tell you.\""]
["12:51,920","12:55,320","\"I can at least get a good job done in most shit.\""]
["12:55,320","12:59,440","\"To me, it seems really valuable to be able to...\""]
["12:59,440","13:02,680","\"We were talking about being able to just put your vision out there.\""]
["13:02,680","13:06,800","\"That if you can do everything that you need for a project that seems like a good thing\""]
["13:06,800","13:07,800","\"to me.\""]
["13:07,800","13:08,800","\"And I assume that's why you did it.\""]
["13:08,800","13:13,800","\"It is, but it's also like if you're doing everything you rarely ever going to get shit\""]
["13:13,800","13:14,800","\"done.\""]
["13:14,800","13:19,160","\"It makes sense because you know you got to be if it would be more efficient time.\""]
["13:19,160","13:21,600","\"I feel like making people working at the same time.\""]
["13:21,600","13:25,960","\"Yeah, like making content should usually be a team effort even if it's stupid bullshit\""]
["13:25,960","13:29,160","\"because you're going to burn yourself out even doing stupid bullshit.\""]
["13:29,160","13:34,160","\"I also very highly believe in the, believe in a collaborative collaboration.\""]
["13:34,160","13:35,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["13:35,160","13:39,160","\"I feel like you generally get better things when different people are mixing ideas.\""]

["13:46,160","13:48,160","\"It's true. You can definitely get that.\""]
["13:48,160","13:50,160","\"It is still good.\""]
["13:50,160","13:55,160","\"I think that Ding Dong, I think that Ding Dong and I went through when we were working on Trigertreat\""]
["13:55,160","13:59,880","\"I told him we can't use the color blue because it's not spooky and\""]

["14:02,880","14:10,760","\"A lot of me spooky ever yeah, I do I think you're allowed to make blue spooky. It's nighttime color. That's what I said\""]

["14:16,480","14:20,560","\"Yeah, I really I really like to make an uncomfortable atmosphere\""]
["14:20,720","14:28,000","\"It can like in Resident Evil the remake when you're walking through the match and the moonlight's creeping. Yeah, that's really nice\""]
["14:28,000","14:34,120","\"Specifically, I think like light night outdoors spooky. Yeah, I'm from that\""]
["14:34,120","14:38,640","\"I don't like rules to color theory\""]
["14:38,640","14:45,320","\"You want me to play? Yeah, gooey. Like I understand certain situations like\""]

["15:24,240","15:28,240","\"I was going to say, I don't like rules to color theory.\""]
["15:28,240","15:31,240","\"Only blue can be used in sad situations.\""]
["15:31,240","15:35,240","\"Or warm colors can be used for comedy or coziness.\""]
