["08:52,420","08:56,220","\"I thought like Captain America seemed to be more of the good guy and the Red Skeleton\""]
["08:56,220","08:57,900","\"seemed to be more of the like bad.\""]
["08:57,900","08:58,900","\"Sure.\""]
["08:58,900","09:01,660","\"That's pretty controversial but I'll be with you on that.\""]

["09:11,900","09:15,580","\"Supposed to be subtle when writing and like making stuff, but I feel like they were too subtle\""]
["09:15,580","09:19,060","\"I just kind of it didn't really go anywhere. Yeah. No dude. I know what you mean\""]
["09:19,060","09:22,220","\"Don't you think red skull would be a better villain\""]
["09:22,220","09:27,960","\"They could be there's no if he was literally just a red skeleton with no clothes on versus Captain America\""]
["09:27,960","09:32,500","\"I'm a stan. He's like you're punching him. He's just an actual skeleton running around\""]
["09:32,500","09:35,000","\"Imagine that motion captured real red skeleton\""]
["09:35,000","09:39,420","\"And he's got a beating her on top of his head\""]
["09:39,980","09:43,420","\"Does he have the eyeballs still or no? He's just a skeleton\""]
["09:43,420","09:49,960","\"Imagine a red skeleton like a really generic like CG red skeleton versus Captain America. That would be cool\""]
["09:49,960","09:53,960","\"Guys by the way, I know I'm not playing very well\""]
["09:53,960","09:59,100","\"But I need the audience to understand something. Yep, so I've never said this before\""]
["09:59,100","10:06,620","\"You need to say it. I need to say this here and now when I'm laughing and having fun. I cannot focus on the game. I'm sorry\""]

["10:12,240","10:15,180","\"He said I trucked up a doctor with her shirt. Yeah\""]
