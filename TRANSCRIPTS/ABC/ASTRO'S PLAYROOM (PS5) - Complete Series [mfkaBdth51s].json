["05:45,060","05:51,740","\"You would be so fucking scared. Yeah, I'm terrified if someone brought that stuff to work and you're making these horrible marks on the ground\""]

["06:10,100","06:12,300","\"This looks pretty\""]
["06:12,300","06:18,100","\"It's very Mario. I honestly think if these people took it not that this isn't a real game\""]
["06:18,100","06:20,180","\"But this isn't a real game. It's not a real game\""]
["06:20,180","06:24,660","\"Like if they took a crack it like an actual like real game\""]
["06:24,660","06:29,300","\"I really think it would actually be really good these guys\""]
["06:29,300","06:33,620","\"They made they made something with this guy before did they yeah\""]
["06:33,620","06:39,180","\"For the eye toy or some something or are you sure they made something?\""]
["06:39,180","06:41,700","\"No, it was for the ps4 VR and it was really good\""]
["06:41,700","06:46,860","\"Oh, maybe that is it is it just Sony itself is making this or I don't know\""]
["06:46,860","06:53,120","\"I guess is the the president of Sony made it all on his own why don't you be useful and look it up or some shit?\""]
["06:53,120","06:57,940","\"I don't know. I actually don't want to know. I like the mystery. It is a mystery box. You're right\""]
["06:57,940","07:01,780","\"What's that supposed to be that's the smoke monster? It's like it's a cloud man\""]
["07:01,780","07:07,660","\"Gusting at you. He's so charming. Can you feel the gust on your vibrating controller?\""]
["07:07,660","07:12,760","\"Wind out of the hole under my cock is it really blowing wind out of the hole my cock is starting to free shut\""]
["07:12,760","07:15,740","\"Did you feel actual pain there? Yes?\""]
["07:15,740","07:20,580","\"Okay, it sticks with the needles out of the controller and stabs you that would be cool\""]
["07:20,580","07:25,660","\"If it stab you in the cock yeah, if it's circumcised you while you're playing\""]
["07:25,660","07:31,020","\"I'm not sure if I've talked about this, but you got circumcised by the ps2. I did\""]
["07:31,020","07:36,620","\"No, I have an irrational fear that like my cockhole is gonna get cauterized shut\""]
["07:36,620","07:40,400","\"Like it specifically I'm sorry I shouldn't laugh at that\""]
["07:40,400","07:45,740","\"It's sort of the same kind of fear is you know when you're up high and you look down and you have that like gut thing\""]
["07:45,740","07:52,340","\"Like oh what if I fall off this sort of the same thing like if I'm ever like if I'm ever like naked and like using a pan\""]
["07:52,340","07:56,980","\"Or something like that like cooking on a stove or some shit. I'm always like fuck\""]
["07:56,980","08:01,420","\"What if like what if my cock gets in there and it cauterizes the dick hole?\""]
["08:01,420","08:07,100","\"I think that's a valid concern and a perfectly good justification not to cook while naked.\""]
["08:07,100","08:10,020","\"Well, what am I supposed to do?\""]
["08:10,020","08:14,020","\"Think about all the hot liquids that you don't want making contact with your skin when you're\""]
["08:14,020","08:17,940","\"like say using a like a pan to fry bacon or something.\""]
["08:17,940","08:18,940","\"Right.\""]
["08:18,940","08:21,300","\"There's a lot of reasons not to cook naked.\""]
["08:21,300","08:22,740","\"Are you a chef?\""]
["08:22,740","08:23,740","\"No.\""]
["08:23,740","08:28,580","\"See Gordon Ramsay is a chef and he's never said anything about not cooking naked.\""]
["08:28,580","08:32,180","\"He's never said anything in favor of cooking naked either.\""]
["08:32,180","08:32,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:32,980","08:37,180","\"So how do laws work in this land, Tomar?\""]
["08:37,180","08:44,980","\"Is it avoid until permitted or engage until told to avoid?\""]
["08:44,980","08:52,260","\"Uh, I don't have an answer ready for that, I guess.\""]
["08:52,260","08:53,700","\"You got your egg.\""]
["08:53,700","08:57,180","\"I think it's-- I think it's do until someone tells you not to,\""]
["08:57,180","08:57,900","\"I guess.\""]
["08:57,900","09:03,700","\"So right I guess that favors your side of this this guy's such an asshole\""]
["09:03,700","09:09,180","\"He's a piece of shit. He's he makes little things. He looks sad that he's doing that to me\""]
["09:09,180","09:22,620","\"That's fair if he's programmed that way he's like he's like a genie that an asshole has a wish on him\""]
["09:22,620","09:24,620","\"And he's like blow these people\""]
["09:24,620","09:28,540","\"They're like sorry. Oh, there should be a game. Oh, yeah\""]
["09:28,540","09:34,740","\"We're like all literally all the enemies you fight are like your family members and they're all being made to fight you against their will\""]
["09:34,740","09:38,820","\"And you just really don't want to fight them brothers with your family\""]
["09:38,820","09:46,980","\"Again, I play that I want to fight my dad. I feel like there's video games that did do that where they're like oh\""]
["09:46,980","09:52,660","\"If you kill these guys your dick you can use these look at that. That's awesome\""]
["09:52,660","09:53,160","\"Awesome.\""]
["09:53,160","09:55,860","\"The jetpacks?\""]
["09:55,860","09:57,180","\"Yeah, you can burn things with it.\""]
["09:57,180","09:58,460","\"Yeah, it makes sense.\""]
["09:58,460","09:59,460","\"Ha ha!\""]
["09:59,460","10:00,360","\"Motherfuckers!\""]
["10:00,360","10:02,060","\"Oh, you can grab those.\""]
["10:02,060","10:03,560","\"Come here.\""]
["10:03,560","10:04,460","\"Yeah, that's right.\""]
["10:04,460","10:05,460","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:05,460","10:06,260","\"That feels good.\""]
["10:06,260","10:07,660","\"Rip the polar hair.\""]
["10:07,660","10:08,560","\"That's so mean.\""]
["10:08,560","10:12,560","\"You're just ripping them apart.\""]
["10:12,560","10:14,160","\"You guys ever go on YouTube and just watch\""]
["10:14,160","10:16,860","\"Mortal Kombat death compilations?\""]
["10:16,860","10:18,860","\"Not in a bit, but yes, I have.\""]
["10:18,860","10:19,460","\"I love that.\""]
["10:19,460","10:21,260","\"I don't want to play it, but I want to watch everyone get\""]
["10:21,260","10:22,060","\"killed horribly.\""]
["10:22,060","10:27,300","\"You know that's all you really want to do whenever you get a more mortal combat game is just watch all the fatalities\""]
["10:27,300","10:29,980","\"By the time you've watched them all you've gone to the next one\""]
["10:29,980","10:35,940","\"I really wish that I could clone myself and play fighting games with me\""]
["10:35,940","10:40,500","\"So that I would be playing against somebody that's exactly my skill level\""]
["10:40,500","10:44,400","\"Because I feel like that's the only circumstance where fighting games are fun\""]
["10:44,400","10:44,780","\"Yeah\""]
["10:44,780","10:51,900","\"Is when you're playing against somebody exactly as good as you I agree because if you're playing some with somebody like way worse than you\""]
["10:51,900","10:54,540","\"Then it's not challenging you're just wailing on it\""]
["10:54,540","10:58,300","\"But if you're playing with somebody way better than you then it's just like I can't fucking do anything\""]
["10:58,300","11:03,460","\"I'm on your side. I don't dedicate a lot of time to fighting games\""]
["11:03,460","11:07,800","\"I can empathize to I so it's one of those things\""]
["11:07,800","11:14,740","\"Like do I do I have to put time into like every single one just so I can like play against the 12 year olds online?\""]
["11:14,740","11:17,220","\"Or do I just not play fighting games?\""]
["11:17,220","11:21,960","\"Look at my hand look how I'm playing this. This is my main solution has just been to know. Oh wow\""]
["11:21,960","11:25,140","\"Yeah, he's this is the weirdest since you can't see this\""]

["11:43,580","11:47,800","\"It's not kind of fair that they have it hard, but also have better like things to play with downstairs\""]

["15:48,140","15:52,620","\"Yeah, GTA 5 like worked a little bit better. You see\""]
["15:53,380","15:59,260","\"GTA 4 has a lot of things that just look and feel super awkward\""]
["15:59,260","16:02,020","\"Yeah, but it's funny\""]
["16:02,020","16:07,800","\"Yeah, I agree with you there, but I think GTA 5 like plays better\""]
["16:07,800","16:14,020","\"There was something to the whole like euphoria engine that was really fun about GTA 4\""]

["24:23,980","24:30,580","\"still share games which you know then the Xbox one it you know went back on their whole thing\""]
["24:30,580","24:36,180","\"about that the Xbox straight up was not going to let you like hand over your\""]
["24:36,180","24:40,020","\"games to another person I forgot they were gonna I think there was a lot of\""]
["24:40,020","24:45,500","\"pushback from consumers and from GameStop it would have killed a huge part of\""]
["24:45,500","24:50,060","\"their business forgot about that to you yeah that that's that would have been\""]
["24:50,060","24:55,480","\"really stupid I hope that they never try it again yeah me too but uh yeah I\""]
["24:55,480","25:02,120","\"I got an Xbox one and I I'm not even exaggerating when I say I literally own one game for it\""]
["25:02,120","25:09,320","\"And that game is halo 5 Xbox one you and I get strongly regret you spent fucking $500 for halo\""]
["25:09,320","25:14,920","\"Oh, no, I got it off somebody used. Okay. It was not nearly that much\""]
["25:14,920","25:18,000","\"But it was uh it was not my best purchase\""]
["25:18,000","25:22,200","\"Xbox one I never bought one that was the same with me in the Wii U\""]
["25:22,200","25:29,640","\"It's gonna say like I've for the last few generations. I've kept up with most consoles, but this guy's having a fucking blast\""]
["25:29,640","25:32,880","\"He loves that he made his friend buff. He sure does\""]
["25:32,880","25:44,160","\"I'd say my favorite thing about these new consoles though is that they are backwards compatible\""]

["25:46,320","25:53,860","\"Can you believe he looks at me? Can you believe it? I mean the upside is that they're probably all gonna remain just normal like x86\""]
["25:53,860","26:01,200","\"Architecture for the sake of like multi-platform releases so backwards compatibility is like at least with all the other\""]
["26:01,200","26:04,640","\"x86 based stuff is gonna be pretty straightforward\""]
["26:04,640","26:11,640","\"That'd be good. I was really really bummed when like the PlayStation 4 came out\""]
["26:11,640","26:14,320","\"And it just like wasn't backwards compatible with anything\""]
["26:14,320","26:20,480","\"But it's because they decided to go with their whole wacky like like billion core architect\""]
["26:20,480","26:21,920","\"What was that chip called?\""]
["26:21,920","26:29,340","\"I don't know, but I know what you're talking about the PlayStation 3 had some weird thing where it it like created RAM out of other\""]
["26:29,340","26:35,240","\"Like components. I don't know what it fucking did, but you know what I'm talking about right Tomar\""]
["26:35,240","26:37,840","\"I think we've had this conversation yet\""]
["26:38,400","26:44,800","\"No, it did a lot of really unique stuff which I think made a lot of people hate porting to it\""]
["26:44,800","26:51,660","\"Yeah, I remember that was a running thing where PlayStation 3 ports of stuff would often be like\""]
["26:51,660","26:54,860","\"Kind of crappy because the architecture was so different\""]
["26:54,860","27:02,380","\"But PlayStation 3 exclusives like looked really really good. Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 4 still looks really fucking good now\""]
["27:02,380","27:06,440","\"It seems like yeah things that were able to actually leverage that technology by design\""]
["27:07,380","27:11,980","\"Ran great. I hate that there's no version of my like your for that you just play now\""]
["27:11,980","27:19,860","\"Yeah, I think that platform is the exact reason why oh, yeah, they're not able to port that right yeah, they'd have to either\""]
["27:19,860","27:26,260","\"Get a stronger system to emulate it, which I think would actually be pretty tough this rocks look what I'm doing here\""]
["27:26,260","27:31,420","\"You like that and you hold down that and it's got the haptic feedback. That's so cool\""]
["27:31,420","27:34,100","\"here you try\""]

["27:50,380","27:56,540","\"It really is and it's it's literally just designed to be like look what your new thing can do\""]
["27:56,540","28:01,460","\"I'm glad they found a way to innovate the controller that doesn't feel like a shitty gimmick it actually feels like\""]
["28:01,460","28:06,220","\"Also, if you're a kid and you just got the console and you didn't get any games yet this\""]
["28:06,220","28:10,380","\"I assume this is free right yeah, so you'd at least have this\""]
["28:10,380","28:16,360","\"This would be a good thing to spend some time on getting used to your new system while you waited to get yes\""]

["38:39,600","38:44,600","\"That was the best console and I'm not just saying that because it was out at the exact\""]

["39:43,380","39:45,760","\"I think GPU jungle sounds like a good old time\""]

["40:12,560","40:15,240","\"Like I don't think it's the length\""]
["40:15,240","40:19,440","\"But this is like Mario Odyssey quality shit. I think so\""]
["40:19,440","40:26,620","\"Like maybe not a gameplay wise, but definitely graphically and polish. Oh shit. It's it's real nice looking\""]

["40:30,920","40:35,280","\"I loved it. That was one of the the Chris O'Neill seal of approval games\""]
["40:35,280","40:38,120","\"I mean it wasn't perfect or nothing, but I liked it a lot\""]
["40:38,120","40:42,120","\"It had that problem of having too much stars that are really annoying to collect\""]
["40:42,120","40:47,280","\"Yeah, I think part of that though was because it was on the switch\""]
["40:47,280","40:51,320","\"I feel like a lot of switch games because the console kind of like pops off\""]
["40:51,320","40:56,000","\"Yeah, designed to kind of be played for like 15 minutes if you want, you know, I mean\""]
["40:56,000","41:01,440","\"Yeah, so rather than having like one star that takes like 20 minutes to get there like oh, yeah\""]
["41:01,440","41:04,200","\"Let's just put a bunch of them in there that take like five minutes to get\""]
["41:04,200","41:14,200","\"Look at that! Yes, that's physics man. That's physics. Looks fucking beautiful.\""]
["41:14,200","41:18,800","\"Even though the little leaves are reacting properly and shit. Where's Tolm here?\""]

["41:33,720","41:35,720","\"He punched him off. Yeah, look\""]
["41:35,720","41:41,960","\"Oh, you like that. He likes them. I think he got mad because you hit the glass\""]
["41:41,960","41:44,940","\"Is that what happened? It's hitting the glass\""]
["41:44,940","41:54,100","\"Oh, he hits you back. That's so cool. You don't know this yet, but you're like a cultural sacrifice\""]

["42:05,680","42:11,240","\"No, when you can hold the battle like sticks so slightly and he walks it like that. Yeah, I like that\""]
["42:11,240","42:13,800","\"Look look at that. You can go so slow\""]
["42:13,800","42:19,000","\"That is a super nice detail and the animation is like different in it or is it yeah\""]
["42:19,000","42:26,380","\"Yeah, I like that a lot. I also like in first-person shooter games when you look down you can see your legs\""]
["42:27,280","42:34,000","\"Yeah, and body most of them do that now, but I remember back in the day like almost none of them did that\""]
["42:34,000","42:39,240","\"So mar you missed it the greatest thing you'll ever see\""]
["42:39,240","42:47,080","\"There's no need to cry check this out. So I need to yell at Chris. There's no need to call bitch a bitch a Chris\""]
