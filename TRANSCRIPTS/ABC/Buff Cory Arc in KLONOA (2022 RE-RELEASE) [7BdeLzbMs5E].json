["25:50,960","25:54,760","\"Yeah, I don't know but I you know it's cute. I really would not want to see\""]
["25:54,760","25:57,880","\"You know what's my top three things?\""]
["25:57,880","26:02,200","\"There's a point in my life where I was absolutely\""]
["26:02,200","26:08,240","\"100% obsessed with Digimon. I was like I was into it way more than I was Pokemon. It was like my favorite thing\""]
["26:08,240","26:12,240","\"Do you like the Angelina and a condo opening or she like I didn't mind it. I was like\""]
["26:12,240","26:16,080","\"I'm gonna see the Diddy Man movie fellow nightmarish child\""]
["26:17,040","26:21,720","\"I think what happened is in Ireland. It wasn't a big deal. No one cared about it\""]
["26:21,720","26:25,820","\"So the once it got phased out it was gone and there was no real way to watch it\""]
["26:25,820","26:28,560","\"I don't think there was video sales or DVD sales\""]
["26:28,560","26:33,360","\"So it literally just got deleted out of my life and it was no way for me to like watch her, you know\""]
["26:33,360","26:38,800","\"Enjoy it anymore. So I think because of that that's the reason why I didn't become a weird obsessed furry or something\""]
["26:38,800","26:41,040","\"What about you Gio?\""]
["26:41,040","26:45,320","\"I never watched that. I was like what it's about cards. This is\""]
["26:46,640","26:52,000","\"I remember thinking Yu-Gi-Oh is cool very very briefly. I like the theme song\""]
["26:52,000","26:58,200","\"I was the theme song that turned off my my school and I've learned that this wasn't a universal thing\""]
["26:58,200","27:00,200","\"It was just for some reason like my school\""]
["27:00,200","27:03,360","\"Everyone just decided like after\""]
["27:03,360","27:09,040","\"The first generation of Pokemon. Yeah, everyone just decided Pokemon was for babies and\""]
["27:10,320","27:16,320","\"Generation is like the honestly I used to think like the first generation is the only Pokemon I like but I do think like\""]
["27:16,320","27:23,680","\"More cool one and four. I think like one two four were good because that I don't I think one and two were good\""]
["27:23,680","27:28,920","\"And the rest is just annoying well you have to think of it this way like the Pokemon games now\""]
["27:28,920","27:34,000","\"Which I don't really I can't fucking believe people still get high for Pokemon. It's the same game\""]
["27:34,800","27:40,400","\"What's called arcaeus we play is so on fucking believably bland and looks like shit\""]
["27:40,400","27:44,020","\"It's really it's the most phoned in crap, and I'm sick of people caring about\""]
["27:44,020","27:46,520","\"Pokemon it's really weird to me\""]
["27:46,520","27:52,820","\"Fuckin you really oh did you see the new drop for generations? Oh it looks exactly the same no innovation\""]
["27:52,820","27:56,740","\"It's they they're completely phoning it in and treating you like chumps\""]
["27:56,740","28:02,760","\"It's literally the most profitable media franchise of all time, and then it's like it's also did you see yeah?\""]
["28:02,760","28:05,480","\"That now you can like move around in the over\""]
["28:05,480","28:15,040","\"It's the same exact thing as generation one except on a 3d plane. Nothing's improved. I want to say something all the poke what go on\""]
["28:15,040","28:17,940","\"I mean, I never played Pokemon, but this is something I've wanted to say\""]
["28:17,940","28:21,600","\"I'm being really bad. Let me let me let me like figure this out, but\""]
["28:21,600","28:26,000","\"I wanted to play the new Pokemon game. Oh\""]
["28:27,200","28:32,280","\"Because everybody was saying that but also like okay. I'll just let me prefix\""]
["28:32,280","28:34,480","\"Is this is that the right term prefix? Yeah?\""]
["28:34,480","28:37,280","\"Prefix or prefix either\""]
["28:37,280","28:41,560","\"Technically grammatically correct. I wanted to play it. Oh\""]
["28:41,560","28:46,160","\"I gotta hold it fucking idiot. Okay. I wanted to play the new\""]
["28:46,160","28:48,880","\"Pokemon game, and I'm like\""]
["28:48,880","28:53,360","\"This is the tweet I made I'm just gonna I keep like going off topic because my brain is shutting down\""]
["28:53,360","28:56,880","\"I'm like I'm like explaining to me like every time I see a new Pokemon game\""]
["28:56,880","29:01,080","\"It looks the exact same as the previous one like the new one looks exactly like the sword and shield one\""]
["29:01,080","29:03,080","\"And I'm like I don't get the hype behind it\""]
["29:03,080","29:05,860","\"But I also said like explain to me how I don't get that\""]
["29:05,860","29:13,420","\"But I somehow understand like Sonic like for me Sonic is like I'll play the same mediocre fucking series over and over\""]
["29:13,420","29:18,760","\"And love every bit of it, but I won't enjoy Pokemon and when I made that tweet that got a ton of attention\""]
["29:19,080","29:24,800","\"But also I noticed a lot of people were like yeah fuck Pokemon and that was like the general consensus\""]
["29:24,800","29:30,720","\"But yet this is the game that sells more than any other game ever. I just don't get it people still play these games\""]
["29:30,720","29:35,080","\"Yeah turned into like the Call of Duty of the Nintendo franchise and people\""]
["29:35,080","29:43,440","\"Complaining it's for children. It's for children. So children would of course enjoy it. That's the point on a Pokemon fans are kind of perpetually\""]
["29:44,280","29:46,280","\"disappointed and I get it.\""]
["29:46,280","29:52,280","\"But I'm saying like if you're a kid I completely understand if you'd enjoy it but I'm talking about adults who obsess over it and they enjoy it.\""]
["29:52,280","29:54,280","\"I don't think they even enjoy it.\""]
["29:54,280","29:56,280","\"No they complain they hate it.\""]
["29:56,280","29:58,280","\"They haven't liked the last four of them.\""]
["29:58,280","30:02,280","\"Oh all I see are super Pokemon fans who are very critical of new Pokemon games.\""]
["30:02,280","30:07,280","\"Yet it's still like the number one selling switch game of all time during then.\""]
["30:07,280","30:10,280","\"They get pulled into the fucking hype for like a month.\""]
["30:10,280","30:11,280","\"And I mean I get it.\""]
["30:11,280","30:12,280","\"I get it.\""]
["30:12,280","30:18,020","\"I love anything Sonic related, but like even then I'm critical of the games and if the game looks like shit\""]
["30:18,020","30:20,020","\"I'm not gonna play it like the new\""]
["30:20,020","30:23,840","\"Sonic Colors game came out. I didn't even buy it because it looked like shit\""]
["30:23,840","30:26,540","\"Dave ended up buying for me. Plus his heart\""]
["30:26,540","30:29,220","\"But I didn't never beat it because it was a piece of garbage\""]
["30:29,220","30:31,380","\"So I get it\""]
["30:31,380","30:33,020","\"But also I don't\""]
["30:33,020","30:40,340","\"Like I saw some screenshots from that new Pokemon game that local wars then fucking dark cloud on PS2 the new new one\""]
["30:40,340","30:44,520","\"No the one our chaos yeah, our taste looks fucking\""]
["30:44,520","30:51,220","\"So better than any other previous book here looks 50 times better than it does\""]
["30:51,220","30:56,580","\"You know the worst part is like that one is probably the best one they put out in a very long time\""]
["30:56,580","31:00,580","\"Insane because it's fucking dog shit. I wouldn't say that it's good\""]
["31:00,580","31:02,920","\"But I like the thing I get annoyed\""]
["31:02,920","31:07,860","\"It's like you can't even get attached to these fucking Pokemon because a new set of Pokemon is gonna come out\""]
["31:07,860","31:12,760","\"Like you can't even enjoy the trainer Pokemon like they have the the weed cat and all this other stuff\""]
["31:12,760","31:19,120","\"The next Pokemon's gonna come out you're gonna have like a fucking plant frog and like a fire toad again or some shit\""]
["31:19,120","31:21,120","\"Like it's not even a matter\""]
["31:21,120","31:25,580","\"Yeah, I think there is a problem that's introduced when they've hit so many of them\""]
["31:25,580","31:32,980","\"That now it's like oh if we want to have every single one we have to make like a thousand models for the next game and animations\""]
["31:32,980","31:34,580","\"Yeah, it's just ridiculous\""]
["31:34,580","31:38,740","\"But also I've never played a single Pokemon game so this mouse is coming from a place of new-\""]
