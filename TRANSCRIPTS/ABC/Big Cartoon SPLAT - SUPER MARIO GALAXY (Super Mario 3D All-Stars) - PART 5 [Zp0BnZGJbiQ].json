["00:36,000","00:39,100","\"Yeah, tender. Oh there you go\""]
["00:39,100","00:45,620","\"I got a drink from tender greens earlier called the greens or something where they just like blend a bunch of like green\""]
["00:45,620","00:51,640","\"Vegetables are really like tender greens. No, it's it's really not good. I feel like it's an overrated rest. It's not gonna\""]
["00:51,640","00:54,760","\"It's actually it always arrives. It's like not very nice\""]
["00:54,760","00:57,960","\"But I was drinking that greens and then I went into my bedroom\""]
["00:57,960","01:03,800","\"And then like 30 minutes later I come out and I look in the mirror and just like green shit all over my leg t-shirt\""]
["01:03,800","01:06,280","\"I like spilled it all over myself like an idiot\""]
["01:06,280","01:08,760","\"and I didn't even notice and\""]
["01:08,760","01:12,480","\"Like it like it's silly, but if you had to see it you would have been like what the fuck?\""]
["01:12,480","01:18,860","\"Like I look so stupid. It was like the biggest cartoon splat I've ever seen kill him kill him kill him\""]

["01:25,760","01:36,640","\"Ever been a good Mario boss fight like ever like you haven't really felt like challenging I kind of know what you mean\""]
["01:36,640","01:41,760","\"Like these are fine for what they are but I feel like some of the\""]
["01:41,760","01:43,800","\"Like never in the main game\""]
["01:43,800","01:49,280","\"But like an odyssey there were some fun ones in like the late game like like the sort of post-end game\""]
["01:49,280","01:55,420","\"I mean the fact that we're kind of all struggling to think of a good one probably says like how do you make like a good\""]
["01:55,420","01:57,980","\"Boss fight for such a like a kind of a slow-moving\""]
["01:57,980","02:00,700","\"platforming thing\""]
["02:00,700","02:04,180","\"You would kind of have to make it like a bit of a level I would think\""]
["02:04,180","02:12,300","\"Yeah, it's kind of a doozy in it kind of that's actually really weird that you point that out because it's like it's fucking Mario, right?\""]
["02:12,300","02:13,620","\"you think\""]
["02:13,620","02:16,780","\"You think it'd be like oh yeah, it's got memorable bosses\""]
["02:16,780","02:19,780","\"But they're typically not the best parts of those games.\""]
["02:19,780","02:22,980","\"Yeah, no, it's really more about the level design than about the bosses.\""]
["02:22,980","02:28,680","\"I think they're really just there just to show that you're progressing and having something satisfying at the end of a thing to say,\""]

["02:30,480","02:33,480","\"Ooh, if it isn't the better rack!\""]
["02:33,480","02:38,680","\"Honestly, a lot of games in general have shitty bosses.\""]
["02:38,680","02:42,880","\"Yeah, and there's a lot of those bosses where it's like the upper torso of the thing,\""]
["02:42,880","02:47,840","\"because you can't... that's the only way to have its face and your character in the same place.\""]
["02:47,840","02:48,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:48,160","02:53,920","\"And again, I don't know what the solution to that is, aside from doing like a shadow of the\""]
["02:53,920","02:59,600","\"Colossus type thing where you literally climb up it. I loved the idea of shadows of the\""]
["02:59,600","03:04,720","\"Colossus. I mean, I like the game itself, but just the idea of it just being a game of giant\""]
["03:04,720","03:10,880","\"boss battles. And I know other people have done similar concepts since then. That game,\""]
["03:10,880","03:16,360","\"Dragon's Dogma had some cool like bosses and large monsters that you can kind of climb up like that\""]
["03:16,360","03:19,280","\"That's right. It had the climbing mechanic as like a\""]
["03:19,280","03:24,440","\"Like in addition to like a full art like action RPG system\""]
["03:24,440","03:29,380","\"Dragon's Dogma is one of those games though. We're like if you just start it from scratch\""]
["03:29,380","03:33,720","\"It sort of suffers from like there's too many fucking things I can do\""]
["03:33,720","03:35,120","\"Yeah, it's yeah\""]
["03:35,120","03:40,280","\"It's weird how that game kind of came back like years and years after it came out now\""]
["03:40,280","03:44,680","\"It's got like a Netflix show what really yeah, what the fuck I?\""]
["03:44,680","03:50,240","\"Like the Witcher show by the way, I know there's mixed opinions on that but I enjoyed it\""]
["03:50,240","03:55,800","\"You also love the game didn't you I'd yeah, I really like the Witcher. I think most people do\""]
["03:55,800","04:00,400","\"Why else are we also hype for them to make cyberpunk? Oh?\""]

["04:18,720","04:24,920","\"Dude, maybe just maybe in like 50 years Redditor is a dirty word\""]
["04:24,920","04:30,320","\"Think of you called someone right now\""]
["04:30,320","04:36,080","\"But in like in like maybe in 20 years people will hate being called it so much like even you to be you\""]
["04:36,080","04:42,100","\"YouTuber is like it just refers to someone who releases videos on YouTube, but like a Redditor is like\""]

["13:01,580","13:04,920","\"He's talking\""]
["13:06,800","13:11,980","\"You have to tuck it all the way around the bag. I hate those tumor rocks so much. Oh\""]
["13:11,980","13:17,400","\"How this sounds oh, I finally saw venom loll. Oh, yeah\""]
["13:17,400","13:23,880","\"Recommended for like seven years. I think Kyle recommended it. I did like it. It was what it wasn't great\""]
["13:23,880","13:30,240","\"But it's still fun. Yeah, it's stupid as hell. It's funny. I wish it was stupid or it's more entertaining than most other\""]
["13:30,240","13:34,260","\"Like movies like them that I would I ever would have expected\""]
["13:34,260","13:38,540","\"I was hoping that it would have gotten like way co-goreier and crazier and stupider\""]
["13:38,540","13:42,840","\"I think originally it was supposed to be rated R and then they said that they couldn't\""]
["13:42,840","13:46,480","\"They pulled like yeah, their hands were tied and they had to make this weird\""]
["13:46,480","13:49,520","\"Weird PG-13 movie\""]
["13:49,520","13:54,240","\"I almost feel like that movie has a little bit of that vibe of like I'm gonna\""]
["13:54,240","14:00,680","\"I'm gonna suggest these stupid things to my boss just to prove he's an idiot kind of things\""]
["14:00,680","14:05,480","\"Yeah, where like there's there's a part literally near like right at the end of the movie\""]
["14:05,480","14:10,840","\"Where it's just voiceover of venom and he's like I'm a good guy now\""]
["14:10,840","14:12,360","\"I used to be a bad guy\""]
["14:12,360","14:19,280","\"But now you are my friend and it's like that nothing in the movie is like happening that it clearly was something added in afterwards\""]
["14:19,280","14:25,480","\"He says the funniest line of the whole movie there. He says for you see on my planet. I was a loser like you\""]
["14:25,480","14:29,720","\"Okay, that actually was the best part of the whole movie though\""]
["14:29,720","14:35,620","\"Even if they had that in for no reason it was the best part. It was funny. Yeah, I'm never gonna beat this game never\""]
["14:35,620","14:38,820","\"No, you're beating you did it. Look at you go. Okay\""]
["14:38,820","14:46,900","\"It's time to go crawl all over your queen again. She's conscripting you you're getting drafted to the war. Oh\""]

["14:59,040","15:01,040","\"Ooh\""]
["15:01,040","15:07,960","\"Finally you can recognize your B-cell. Yeah assume the form. Oh you got to go up the the dandelion\""]
["15:07,960","15:09,960","\"You got to spin on it, or you could do that\""]
["15:09,960","15:14,680","\"Or you could just die. Nope. I'm not dying. Ha ha\""]
["15:14,680","15:17,680","\"Whoa, okay\""]
["15:17,680","15:20,840","\"There you go, this gives you a nice little boost\""]

["15:30,000","15:33,640","\"You kind of cheated the angle there, huh?\""]
["15:33,640","15:35,480","\"So what's it supposed to do?\""]
["15:35,480","15:37,200","\"I mean, I guess that's okay.\""]
["15:37,200","15:39,000","\"He's got a little piss hole on the bottom.\""]
["15:39,000","15:41,840","\"It's his cloaca.\""]
["15:41,840","15:45,680","\"Bugs don't have cloaca's.\""]
["15:45,680","15:47,240","\"What do they have then, genius?\""]
["15:47,240","15:49,000","\"Shitholes and piss holes.\""]
["15:49,000","15:50,640","\"Do they have separate dicks and balls?\""]
["15:50,640","15:51,640","\"Yeah, I would be surprised if they--\""]
["15:51,640","15:52,640","\"Anuses and--\""]
["15:52,640","15:53,640","\"Are you sure that's true, Chris?\""]
["15:53,640","15:57,600","\"I would have thought they would be more likely to have a cloaca.\""]
["15:57,600","16:03,840","\"They've got shit holes in piss holes. Okay. No, I don't know. I'm just like they've got two dicks\""]
["16:03,840","16:05,840","\"I mean I honestly don't know\""]
["16:05,840","16:08,280","\"vaginas and\""]
["16:08,280","16:10,280","\"They've got a lot of attitude\""]
["16:10,280","16:15,080","\"That thing felt actual pain\""]
["16:15,080","16:18,720","\"Poor little fellow\""]
["16:18,720","16:24,480","\"To be fair he was being a pest. Yeah, that's true. But so was Mario. You're right\""]
["16:25,560","16:32,640","\"I've always found it kind of uncanny how Mario is like always smiling. He's almost never like angry or\""]
["16:32,640","16:37,720","\"Scared or anything like that even when the situation totally calls for it\""]
["16:37,720","16:41,000","\"I've got a little bit better about that and like Odyssey and stuff\""]
["16:41,000","16:46,460","\"But in the old Mario games like people would be dying around to me just jump and be like\""]
["16:46,460","16:52,140","\"Okay, Luigi's the scared one. Yeah, we'll go to the battle rock\""]
["16:52,140","16:55,040","\"fly to the galaxy\""]
["16:55,040","17:01,720","\"Oh, was that trash exploding thing that I did the last time was that not even what I was supposed to do there\""]
["17:01,720","17:05,680","\"What do you mean because it said you had like the star star in oh?\""]
["17:05,680","17:10,920","\"I don't know. I think the trash thing you did was like a one star level. I think that was a separate thing\""]
["17:10,920","17:15,160","\"I would give it one star if I were to read the quality of it\""]
["17:15,160","17:19,920","\"I remember the first time I saw the the trailer for that movie gravity\""]
["17:19,920","17:22,600","\"It actually made me laugh\""]
["17:23,240","17:33,400","\"Because because the movie was called gravity it seemed like one of those like lazy like premise movies where somebody like thinks of the title first and then the movie afterwards\""]
["17:33,400","17:41,680","\"It seemed like they they just went where would gravity be the scariest the highest up place of all space\""]
["17:41,680","17:47,840","\"A lot of movies do this thing where they'll have like a big disaster happen\""]
["17:47,840","17:53,040","\"But they'll also have the character going through some kind of inner turmoil. That's completely unrelated. Oh, yeah\""]
["17:53,040","17:57,680","\"Like oh, we're going through the apocalypse, but my daughter is going off to college\""]
["17:57,680","18:03,440","\"Yes, I don't understand why that's even part of the story is to try to make it more relatable to\""]
["18:03,440","18:08,680","\"viewers like you but in that movie she's like my daughter died\""]
["18:08,680","18:16,320","\"Like I don't know your daughter lady. I don't care. Wow. This is my space right now\""]
["18:16,320","18:19,760","\"Would you say that right to her face? No?\""]
["18:20,520","18:27,860","\"Well, then why would you say it here? She's gonna see this Sandra bollocks. Well, that's not Sandra Bullock the character from the movie\""]
["18:27,860","18:29,420","\"um\""]
["18:29,420","18:33,900","\"I would just say it was really cool. You survived space that she'd be like my daughter's dead\""]
["18:33,900","18:36,380","\"Like okay\""]
["18:36,380","18:38,380","\"The space was cool though\""]
["18:38,380","18:46,760","\"She would get a green heart that's the one they give you for surviving or dying in space. I didn't see the movie\""]
["18:46,760","18:53,580","\"I don't know if she dies, but yeah, that's every disaster movies problem. It's like oh my moorajes fail like it's like at the end of the\""]
["18:53,580","18:55,420","\"Movie, you know what I learned?\""]
["18:55,420","18:57,300","\"Families importance like I don't care\""]
["18:57,300","19:01,940","\"I just wanted to see a cool title a rip apart a city all it took was the Mayan apocalypse\""]
["19:01,940","19:04,180","\"Dude, did you see the new Godzilla?\""]
["19:04,180","19:09,460","\"Yeah, that's just the newest one. Oh, I mean the one with one of the monsters whatever. Yeah, yeah\""]
["19:09,460","19:12,860","\"That one's pretty boring to well the monster stuff is better in it\""]
["19:12,860","19:17,860","\"But like the human drama is absolutely the stupidest fucking thing in that.\""]
["19:17,860","19:19,860","\"That always sucks. Why do they keep doing that?\""]
["19:19,860","19:22,860","\"It even feels like the people writing it don't want to be writing it.\""]
["19:22,860","19:23,860","\"They don't.\""]
["19:23,860","19:28,860","\"They were specifically told by the producers who don't know anything.\""]
["19:28,860","19:32,860","\"We need to have people like feel connected with the characters.\""]
["19:32,860","19:36,860","\"And then the writers like, they just want to see monsters smashing each other.\""]
["19:36,860","19:37,860","\"They do.\""]
["19:37,860","19:38,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["19:38,860","19:41,860","\"It's Godzilla making chocolate pudding.\""]
