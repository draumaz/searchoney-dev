["03:47,780","03:53,100","\"I don't think it's going to explain either why somehow he was able to get through your gaming device and talk to you this way\""]

["03:56,260","03:59,020","\"Oh brother\""]
["03:59,020","04:01,020","\"I don't know what will happen\""]

["04:07,260","04:10,140","\"Us\""]
["04:10,140","04:15,400","\"I think this is funny, but it also has destroyed the only thing about the game I liked which was that it was like a\""]

["04:22,500","04:27,480","\"No, did you not consider when you entered your names that none of them showed up in the game anyway?\""]
["04:27,480","04:30,680","\"Yeah, no, I knew that okay like I've seen earthbound do that shit\""]
["04:30,680","04:34,840","\"And I've never noticed it like having an actual effect, but I never got that far so whatever\""]
["04:34,840","04:41,400","\"But still it's like okay now. I mean this is very ridiculous that even the switches there and everything\""]
["04:41,400","04:44,720","\"Anyway, let's continue\""]
["04:44,720","04:49,040","\"I hope it gets to show me in real life right now\""]
