["00:18,900","00:19,860","\"This rocks.\""]
["00:19,860","00:21,900","\"It's like Superman 64.\""]
["00:21,900","00:24,900","\"That's the first thing that popped in your head.\""]
["00:24,900","00:26,420","\"You're flying through hoops.\""]
["00:26,420","00:28,420","\"I guess that's true.\""]
["00:28,420","00:30,320","\"What a horrible game.\""]
["00:30,320","00:33,180","\"- That's such a weird mechanic to be like,\""]
["00:33,180","00:35,540","\"if you're Superman, here's what you wanna do.\""]
["00:35,540","00:38,900","\"- Yeah, you wanna fly through a bunch of hoops.\""]

["00:44,980","00:48,700","\"It's actually really fun to just fly around in that game.\""]
["00:48,700","00:50,420","\"I remember I played the demo of that\""]
["00:50,420","00:52,980","\"and I played a futon of it.\""]
["00:52,980","00:56,220","\"But everything that's not flying around\""]
["00:56,220","00:57,900","\"just feels like shit.\""]
["00:57,900","01:00,100","\"But the flying around is actually really cool.\""]
["01:00,100","01:02,780","\"This is really cool.\""]
["01:02,780","01:03,900","\"This is really cool.\""]

["01:23,500","01:27,100","\"I like the ball.\""]
["01:27,700","01:29,080","\"It is a lovely ball.\""]
["01:29,080","01:30,180","\"- I like the ball, man.\""]
["01:30,180","01:31,020","\"- I love the ball.\""]
["01:31,020","01:32,940","\"Tuba.\""]
["01:32,940","01:34,800","\"- What would you say you're in love with the ball?\""]
["01:34,800","01:37,100","\"Or just that you love the ball platonically?\""]
["01:37,100","01:38,660","\"- I'm in love with it.\""]
["01:38,660","01:39,500","\"- You're in love with it?\""]
["01:39,500","01:40,340","\"- I think so.\""]
["01:40,340","01:41,180","\"- You know what, that's fair.\""]
["01:41,180","01:42,500","\"I was kind of going back and forth,\""]
["01:42,500","01:43,340","\"but you know what?\""]
["01:43,340","01:44,860","\"I think I'm in love with it too, man.\""]
["01:44,860","01:46,780","\"- I think Plato would be in love with it.\""]
["01:46,780","01:47,620","\"- Plato?\""]
["01:47,620","01:48,660","\"Like the philosopher?\""]
["01:48,660","01:52,420","\"- Yeah, for whom the term platonically is named.\""]
["01:52,420","01:53,260","\"- Wait, really?\""]
["01:53,260","01:54,260","\"- Yeah, he would love Ed fuck the ball.\""]
["01:54,260","01:56,120","\"- I thought you meant Plato, like, like, like,\""]
["01:56,120","01:57,440","\"- Clato.\""]
["01:57,440","01:58,480","\"- Oh no. - Like the toy?\""]
["01:58,480","02:00,480","\"Yeah, well the CEO of Clato also--\""]
["02:00,480","02:01,800","\"- Look at the T, not a D.\""]
["02:01,800","02:04,200","\"- Yeah, but honestly the creator of Clato\""]
["02:04,200","02:08,040","\"would probably love and be in deep lust with this ball.\""]
["02:08,040","02:09,960","\"- Wait, is it called Play-Doh or Clato?\""]
["02:09,960","02:11,400","\"Which is the knockoff version?\""]
["02:11,400","02:14,440","\"- Clato is the fake one, at least in American.\""]
["02:14,440","02:15,400","\"- Oh.\""]
["02:15,400","02:18,200","\"- Yeah, Play-Doh is definitely the real one.\""]
["02:18,200","02:19,880","\"- And I think there's an H in Doh,\""]
["02:19,880","02:21,680","\"like the Homer Simpson Doh in there.\""]
["02:21,680","02:22,720","\"- Yeah, it's a, what?\""]
["02:22,720","02:24,880","\"No, wait, is it actually now I don't remember\""]
["02:24,880","02:26,220","\"- How they spell it.\""]
["02:26,220","02:29,560","\"- Did I just, did I just Mandela affect that into your brain?\""]
["02:29,560","02:30,740","\"- No, you might be right.\""]
["02:30,740","02:33,000","\"It maybe spells, it maybe sort of.\""]
["02:33,000","02:35,340","\"- I said it to fuck with you, but now I'm second guessing it.\""]
["02:35,340","02:39,560","\"- It might be spelled D-O-H and not D-O-G-A, D-O-U-G-H.\""]
["02:39,560","02:40,600","\"- Holy fuck.\""]
["02:40,600","02:42,280","\"- No!\""]
["02:42,280","02:44,880","\"- 'Cause isn't it just PLA, D-O-A?\""]
["02:44,880","02:45,720","\"- The man.\""]
["02:45,720","02:47,960","\"- D-O-Y, oh no, it's play D-O-H.\""]
["02:47,960","02:48,780","\"- It'll be up.\""]
["02:48,780","02:49,680","\"- I told you.\""]
["02:49,680","02:50,520","\"- Yeah.\""]
["02:50,520","02:51,560","\"- I should have never doubted me.\""]
["02:51,560","02:54,080","\"You made me, I meant, I'll affected you,\""]
["02:54,080","02:56,320","\"and then you Mandela affected me back.\""]
["02:56,320","02:58,400","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:58,400","03:00,040","\"- Tomar's always Mandela affecting.\""]
["03:00,040","03:02,120","\"- That's why it's actually called the Tomar effect.\""]
["03:02,120","03:03,800","\"You're just remembering it, Rob.\""]
["03:03,800","03:05,320","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:05,320","03:08,400","\"- I remember I turned anti-aliasing on Tomar off\""]
["03:08,400","03:10,720","\"and then he got to like a steady 60 frame\""]
["03:10,720","03:12,800","\"so I can turn Mandela affecting back on.\""]
["03:12,800","03:14,280","\"- Oh no!\""]
["03:14,280","03:15,120","\"- Jesus.\""]
["03:15,120","03:17,200","\"- It runs like a dream.\""]
["03:17,200","03:18,240","\"- Tomar runs like a dream?\""]
["03:18,240","03:19,240","\"- He does.\""]
["03:19,240","03:20,080","\"- I guess he does.\""]
["03:20,080","03:22,520","\"- For miles and miles no less.\""]
["03:22,520","03:23,360","\"- Look what I see.\""]
["03:23,360","03:25,680","\"- Yes, yes.\""]
["03:25,680","03:26,520","\"Excellent.\""]
["03:26,520","03:27,340","\"- Yes!\""]
["03:27,340","03:28,600","\"- Forward then.\""]

["03:29,420","03:30,260","\"- No!\""]
["03:30,260","03:31,160","\"- Did you see that?\""]
["03:31,160","03:32,000","\"- No!\""]
["03:32,000","03:33,480","\"- That was the most fucking cool shit ever.\""]
["03:33,480","03:35,180","\"- Oh, this is some physics.\""]

["03:39,400","03:41,540","\"- Oh, that was awesome and then it sucked.\""]
["03:41,540","03:42,520","\"- Fuck!\""]
["03:42,520","03:43,700","\"- Oh, I need to go into this.\""]
["03:43,700","03:44,540","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:44,540","03:45,700","\"- I don't think you can make that without the hoop.\""]
["03:45,700","03:46,520","\"- Ooh.\""]
["03:46,520","03:47,720","\"- I guess I got a, no.\""]

["04:40,820","04:46,700","\"Yeah, oh, okay. What is it that well the bad news is as I found out that I'm not your real father\""]
["04:46,900","04:49,280","\"Jack Black is actually your real father.\""]
["04:49,280","04:51,380","\"The good news is I still want to be part of your life.\""]
["04:51,380","04:53,620","\"My-- Your mother and I are fine.\""]
["04:53,620","04:56,320","\"- Eugh. - And here's Jack Black's phone number.\""]
["04:56,320","05:00,320","\"Do you pursue a relationship, a dad relationship with Jack Black?\""]
["05:00,320","05:01,020","\"Or do you--\""]
["05:01,020","05:02,320","\"- I mean, I feel like that's fair.\""]
["05:02,320","05:04,920","\"But I still have my-- my-- my fake daddy.\""]
["05:04,920","05:06,220","\"He still raised me really good.\""]

["05:17,860","05:21,160","\"Jack Black did kind of abandon Chris.\""]
["05:21,160","05:25,860","\"Yeah, he abandoned me, so like my fake dad is at least the better father, so...\""]
["05:25,860","05:28,360","\"I'd be like, \"\"You know what, Jack Black, you're a Hollywood dickhead.\"\"\""]
["05:28,360","05:33,860","\"But I bet if Jack Black heard this, he's like, \"\"Well, I didn't really do that, and he'd just be really sad that you said he was a bad father.\"\"\""]
["05:33,860","05:37,860","\"Yeah, what if your mom told Jack Black to get out and never contact her again?\""]
["05:37,860","05:42,860","\"I would get the fuck out and just be like, \"\"How dare you call my dad a bad father?\"\"\""]
["05:42,860","05:45,160","\"- I would get the full story.\""]
["05:45,160","05:47,060","\"I'd be like, so what really happened then?\""]
["05:47,060","05:50,180","\"And if his story's convincing, I'd be like, okay, that's fine.\""]
["05:50,180","05:51,420","\"- Okay, but that's not the question.\""]
["05:51,420","05:52,900","\"- You just never knew you were born.\""]
["05:52,900","05:55,260","\"- Do you get the real story on December 25th\""]
["05:55,260","05:56,940","\"or on January 3rd?\""]
["05:56,940","05:58,340","\"That's the question I'm asking.\""]
["05:58,340","06:01,580","\"- I would get the real story on December 23rd.\""]
["06:01,580","06:04,580","\"- Okay, so you'd meet up with Jack Black before Christmas.\""]
["06:04,580","06:07,580","\"- Just to help make your decision of where to spend it.\""]
["06:07,580","06:10,540","\"- No, I don't even know who's my real dad right now, do I?\""]
["06:10,540","06:11,540","\"- Well, you do know--\""]
["06:11,540","06:15,300","\"- You just confirmed the Jack Black is your real biological dad.\""]
["06:15,300","06:16,980","\"- Yeah, I'd say after Christmas,\""]
["06:16,980","06:18,860","\"you just ask his DNA and their database and they say,\""]
["06:18,860","06:20,320","\"\"\"After Christmas, I'll come visit you\""]
["06:20,320","06:22,180","\"\"\"and you tell me everything.\"\"\""]
["06:22,180","06:24,540","\"- What if Jack Black for Christmas gives you\""]
["06:24,540","06:26,740","\"a vial of his blood and he says,\""]
["06:26,740","06:29,900","\"\"\"Okay, I instantly block him on everything.\"\"\""]
["06:29,900","06:31,500","\"- Wait, you didn't even hear his proposition.\""]
["06:31,500","06:32,500","\"- Okay, okay, go.\""]
["06:32,500","06:36,140","\"- You can inject the blood and become a younger Jack Black\""]
["06:36,140","06:38,140","\"with all of my powers.\""]
["06:38,140","06:39,860","\"- So I'm really good at guitar and singing?\""]
["06:39,860","06:40,700","\"- Yes.\""]
["06:40,700","06:41,760","\"- And kind of good at acting?\""]

["06:42,600","06:45,360","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:45,360","06:48,120","\"- That's actually, that sounds like a backhanded compliment.\""]
["06:48,120","06:49,120","\"- I know, I know, but.\""]
["06:49,120","06:51,760","\"- If you consider Jack Black's pretty good at acting\""]
["06:51,760","06:53,560","\"and that's like his third best ability\""]
["06:53,560","06:54,720","\"in the eyes of Chris, that's the best ability\""]
["06:54,720","06:55,560","\"he's been playing.\""]
["06:55,560","06:56,400","\"- Best ability is like sing.\""]
["06:56,400","06:59,440","\"I kind of wish he would just sing more like albums.\""]
["06:59,440","07:00,480","\"- I do too.\""]
["07:00,480","07:02,440","\"- I wish he'd do a cover album.\""]
["07:02,440","07:03,600","\"- I'd listen to that.\""]
["07:03,600","07:05,160","\"I love his singing voice.\""]
["07:05,160","07:07,760","\"But yeah, I would just be like, what the fuck?\""]
["07:07,760","07:09,200","\"Like, how did this even happen?\""]
["07:09,200","07:11,600","\"You wanna hear a funny story about Jack Black and my dad though really?\""]
["07:11,600","07:14,000","\"Sure, you did on Earth history.\""]
["07:14,000","07:19,720","\"When I was growing up, one of my friends, he used to play these gigs in Wexford town\""]
["07:19,720","07:24,120","\"when he was like 16, so he'd play guitar and his brother would play drums.\""]
["07:24,120","07:28,160","\"And then one time they came over to my house at like after school and they were like,\""]
["07:28,160","07:31,480","\"\"\"Chris, we're thinking about asking Jack Black to come to Wexford.\"\"\""]
["07:31,480","07:33,960","\"And they were saying this at the dinner table.\""]
["07:33,960","07:38,200","\"And then my dad was like, \"\"You think you're gonna get Jack Black to come to Wexford?\"\"\""]
["07:38,200","07:39,940","\"And they're like, yeah, he's like,\""]
["07:39,940","07:40,940","\"Duh!\""]
["07:40,940","07:42,440","\"He's certainly laughing in their faces.\""]
