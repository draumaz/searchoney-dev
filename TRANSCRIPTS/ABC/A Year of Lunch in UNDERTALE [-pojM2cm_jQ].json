["00:01,600","00:05,800","\"One time, Alphys' friend came over here.\""]
["00:05,800","00:08,800","\"All he did was lie seductively on the piano.\""]
["00:08,800","00:11,200","\"- Jesus. - And fed himself grapes.\""]
["00:11,200","00:13,100","\"I don't really like that guy.\""]
["00:13,100","00:15,600","\"But I admire his lifestyle.\""]
["00:15,600","00:20,600","\"And the sink is a teacup in the shape of a fish.\""]
["00:20,600","00:21,100","\"*sigh*\""]
["00:21,100","00:25,400","\"This oven is some top of the line, MIT thing.\""]
["00:25,400","00:28,200","\"But you know, as much as technology advances,\""]
["00:28,200","00:31,200","\"Nothing beats food home cooked with fire magic.\""]
["00:31,200","00:32,200","\"Hmm.\""]
["00:32,200","00:34,800","\"There's a silverware drawer.\""]
["00:34,800","00:40,440","\"It has forks, spoons, knives, tiny swords, axes, spears, nunchucks.\""]
["00:40,440","00:41,440","\"One.\""]
["00:41,440","00:43,360","\"Can I go in the bone drawer?\""]
["00:43,360","00:44,360","\"Yes.\""]
["00:44,360","00:45,360","\"Mmm.\""]
["00:45,360","00:46,360","\"Motherfucker.\""]
["00:46,360","00:52,400","\"He's always coming back.\""]
["00:52,400","00:54,640","\"I hate cold food.\""]
["00:54,640","00:58,160","\"So office fixed up my fridge so it heats up food instead.\""]
["00:58,160","01:00,900","\"Hot fridge! The world's greatest invention!\""]
["01:00,900","01:03,060","\"Get rid of the oven though.\""]
["01:03,060","01:06,360","\"Humans suck, but their history kind of rules.\""]
["01:06,360","01:09,760","\"Case in po- I feel like I'm making her sound too much like-\""]
["01:09,760","01:11,460","\"-slight papyrus. -No!\""]
["01:11,460","01:11,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:11,960","01:13,660","\"Whoops.\""]
["01:13,660","01:17,860","\"You- you like 1% gradually went into it over time and I didn't even notice.\""]
["01:17,860","01:21,760","\"Case in point, this giant sword.\""]
["01:21,760","01:26,360","\"Historically, humans wielded swords up to ten times their size.\""]
["01:26,360","01:27,760","\"True.\""]
["01:27,760","01:30,760","\"-Troughed it. -I knew it!\""]
["01:30,760","01:33,760","\"When I first heard that, I immediately wanted one.\""]
["01:33,760","01:37,760","\"So me and Alfas built a giant sword together.\""]
["01:37,760","01:39,760","\"She figured out all the specs yourself.\""]
["01:39,760","01:41,760","\"She's smart, huh?\""]
["01:41,760","01:43,760","\"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\""]
["01:43,760","01:47,760","\"-So we're going to her room and up. -Let's see my room.\""]
["01:47,760","01:50,760","\"Yes. Too bad. No nerds allowed.\""]
["01:50,760","01:53,760","\"Well, maybe some nerds.\""]
["01:53,760","01:54,760","\"So we can?\""]
["01:54,760","01:56,760","\"Uh, let's just talk to her.\""]
["01:56,760","01:58,760","\"It's so nice to have you over.\""]
["01:58,760","02:00,760","\"Why not take a seat at the table?\""]
["02:00,760","02:02,760","\"Yeah, Tomar.\""]
["02:02,760","02:04,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:04,760","02:07,760","\"Comfortable.\""]
["02:07,760","02:09,760","\"I'll get you something to drink.\""]
["02:09,760","02:11,760","\"Nah.\""]
["02:11,760","02:13,760","\"She a skinny bitch.\""]
["02:13,760","02:14,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:14,760","02:15,760","\"She a twink.\""]
["02:15,760","02:17,760","\"Without all that armor on ya.\""]
["02:17,760","02:19,760","\"I'll set what would you like?\""]
["02:19,760","02:21,760","\"Oh my god.\""]
["02:21,760","02:23,760","\"Hey, bitch!\""]
["02:23,760","02:24,600","\"- Bitch!\""]
["02:24,600","02:25,440","\"- Don't get up!\""]
["02:25,440","02:26,280","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:26,280","02:28,960","\"You're the guest, sit down and enjoy yourself.\""]
["02:28,960","02:33,400","\"Why not just point to what you want?\""]
["02:33,400","02:34,600","\"You can use the spear.\""]
["02:34,600","02:37,040","\"- Wow.\""]
["02:37,040","02:37,880","\"- Let's see.\""]
["02:37,880","02:39,920","\"Do we want tea?\""]
["02:39,920","02:42,500","\"Or yellow liquid?\""]
["02:42,500","02:43,340","\"- No.\""]
["02:43,340","02:45,200","\"- Persona or hot chocolate?\""]
["02:45,200","02:46,040","\"- Hot chocolate.\""]
["02:46,040","02:46,880","\"- Well there's tea.\""]
["02:46,880","02:47,720","\"- Or tea box.\""]
["02:47,720","02:48,640","\"- Chocolate.\""]
["02:48,640","02:50,840","\"- Blatenly correct choice it says though.\""]
["02:50,840","02:51,840","\"- Yeah, yeah, Blatenly.\""]
["02:51,840","02:52,920","\"- Okay, do the dead.\""]
["02:52,920","02:53,420","\"Yeah!\""]
["02:53,420","02:55,920","\"Uh, chocolate milk tea, huh?\""]
["02:55,920","02:56,920","\"Coming right up.\""]
["02:56,920","02:58,920","\"It's so blatantly right.\""]
["02:58,920","03:00,920","\"Hmm.\""]
["03:00,920","03:03,920","\"She's spat in it.\""]
["03:03,920","03:05,920","\"She's shit in it.\""]
["03:05,920","03:08,920","\"No, she may have never.\""]
["03:08,920","03:11,920","\"It'll take a moment for the water to boil.\""]
["03:11,920","03:14,920","\"She did a bit of a lactation movement.\""]
["03:14,920","03:15,920","\"Ew.\""]
["03:15,920","03:19,920","\"I think that might be in this canon of undertow.\""]
["03:21,920","03:24,120","\"I think that's built into all the cannon.\""]
["03:24,120","03:28,400","\"I think maybe a dying is a mammal, even though she appears to be a fish.\""]
["03:28,400","03:30,120","\"And she uses lactation.\""]
["03:30,120","03:32,520","\"Okay, it's all done. Cool.\""]
["03:32,520","03:35,440","\"This is a good question, but is there male and women fish?\""]
["03:35,440","03:38,280","\"Yes. Yes, there is. I'm fucking stupid.\""]
["03:38,280","03:38,800","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:38,800","03:40,720","\"Haven't you ever seen Finding Nemo?\""]
["03:40,720","03:42,520","\"Yeah, but that's a good question.\""]
["03:42,520","03:43,920","\"No, I'm just kidding.\""]
["03:43,920","03:44,920","\"Oh.\""]
["03:44,920","03:46,920","\"Here we are.\""]
["03:46,920","03:50,120","\"I'm wrong.\""]
["03:50,120","03:51,720","\"Careful. It's hot.\""]
["03:51,720","03:56,560","\"It's not that hot.\""]
["03:56,560","03:58,640","\"Just drink it already.\""]
["03:58,640","04:00,000","\"You take a sip of the tea.\""]
["04:00,000","04:01,640","\"It's burning.\""]
["04:01,640","04:04,480","\"But other than that, it's pretty good.\""]
["04:04,480","04:05,480","\"It's pretty good, right?\""]
["04:05,480","04:10,040","\"Nothing but the best for my absolutely precious friend.\""]
["04:10,040","04:13,440","\"God, she's so passive aggressive.\""]
["04:13,440","04:16,560","\"Hey, you know, it's kind of strange to choose.\""]
["04:16,560","04:18,760","\"You chose that tea.\""]
["04:18,760","04:20,360","\"Goldenflower tea.\""]
["04:20,360","04:22,360","\"It's Asgore's favorite kind.\""]
["04:22,360","04:27,480","\"Actually, now that I think about it, you kind of remind me of him.\""]
["04:27,480","04:30,160","\"You're both total weenies!\""]
["04:30,160","04:31,160","\"Sort of.\""]
["04:31,160","04:33,000","\"Oh, I'm not.\""]
["04:33,000","04:37,400","\"You know, I was a pretty hot-headed kid.\""]
["04:37,400","04:41,400","\"Once to prove I was the strongest, I tried to fight Asgore.\""]
["04:41,400","04:43,000","\"Emphasis on \"\"tried.\"\"\""]
["04:43,000","04:46,440","\"I couldn't land a single blow on him.\""]
["04:46,440","04:49,840","\"And worse, the whole time he refused to fight back.\""]
["04:49,840","04:52,580","\"I was so humiliated.\""]
["04:52,580","04:55,980","\"Afterwards, he apologized and said something goofy.\""]
["04:55,980","04:56,980","\"\"\"Excuse me?\""]
["04:56,980","04:59,460","\"Do you want to know how to beat me?\"\"\""]
["04:59,460","05:02,980","\"I said yes, and from then on, he trained me.\""]
["05:02,980","05:06,260","\"One day during practice, I finally knocked him down.\""]
["05:06,260","05:07,420","\"I felt...bad.\""]
["05:07,420","05:10,700","\"But he was beaming.\""]
["05:10,700","05:14,620","\"I'd never seen someone more proud to get their butt kicked.\""]
["05:14,620","05:18,740","\"Anyway, long story short, he kept training me.\""]
["05:18,740","05:21,680","\"And now I'm the head of the Royal Guard.\""]
["05:21,680","05:25,000","\"So I'm the one who gets to train dorks to fight.\""]
["05:25,000","05:27,240","\"Like Papyrus.\""]
["05:27,240","05:28,240","\"Hmm.\""]
["05:28,240","05:29,240","\"Hm.\""]
["05:29,240","05:30,240","\"Hm.\""]
["05:30,240","05:37,940","\"But uh, to be honest, I don't know if I can ever let Papyrus into the Royal Guard.\""]
["05:37,940","05:39,540","\"Don't tell him I said that.\""]
["05:39,540","05:43,860","\"He's just, well, I mean it's not that he's weak.\""]
["05:43,860","05:46,020","\"He's actually pretty freaking tough.\""]
["05:46,020","05:48,020","\"It's just that he's...\""]
["05:48,020","05:50,020","\"He's too innocent and nice.\""]
["05:50,020","05:52,020","\"I mean, look.\""]
["05:52,020","05:54,020","\"He was supposed to capture you.\""]
["05:54,020","05:57,020","\"And he ended up being friends with you instead.\""]
["05:57,020","06:00,020","\"I could never send him into battle.\""]
["06:00,020","06:03,020","\"He'd get ripped into little smiling shreds.\""]
["06:03,020","06:05,020","\"That's part of why...\""]
["06:05,020","06:08,020","\"I started teaching him how to cook, you know?\""]
["06:08,020","06:12,020","\"So, uh, maybe he can do something else with his life.\""]
["06:12,020","06:14,020","\"Oh, sweet.\""]
["06:14,020","06:17,620","\"*Cough* Oh, sorry, I was talking for so long.\""]
["06:17,620","06:19,620","\"You're out of tea, aren't you?\""]
["06:19,620","06:21,620","\"I'll get you some more.\""]
["06:21,620","06:26,120","\"Wait a second.\""]
["06:26,120","06:27,820","\"Papyrus.\""]
["06:27,820","06:29,620","\"His cooking lesson.\""]
["06:29,620","06:32,620","\"He was supposed to have that right now!\""]
["06:32,620","06:35,120","\"And if he's not here to have it,\""]
["06:35,120","06:37,920","\"you'll have to have it for him!\""]
["06:37,920","06:40,720","\"*Chuckles*\""]
["06:40,720","06:42,720","\"*Sigh*\""]
["06:42,720","07:01,720","\"Jesus. That's right. Oh my god. Nothing is brought from fire so I closer than cooking. Which means that if I give you his lesson, we'll become closer than you can ever imagine. F-hahaha afraid? We're gonna be best friends.\""]
["07:01,720","07:05,720","\"Jesus. Ah!\""]
["07:05,720","07:08,720","\"Let's start with the sauce.\""]
["07:08,720","07:12,720","\"Envision these vegetables as your greatest enemy.\""]
["07:12,720","07:15,720","\"Now pound them to dust with your fists.\""]
["07:15,720","07:18,720","\"How will you pound? Strong or wimpy?\""]
["07:18,720","07:19,720","\"Strong.\""]
["07:19,720","07:23,720","\"You punch the vegetables at full force, you knock over a tomato.\""]
["07:23,720","07:28,720","\"Yeah, yeah! Our hearts are uniting against these healthy ingredients.\""]
["07:28,720","07:30,720","\"Now it's my turn.\""]
["07:30,720","07:31,560","\"Yeah!\""]
["07:31,560","07:35,820","\"Jesus, you made a mess.\""]
["07:35,820","07:38,960","\"Well, we'll just scrape this into a bowl later.\""]
["07:38,960","07:40,100","\"But for now,\""]
["07:40,100","07:45,020","\"we add the noodles.\""]
["07:45,020","07:47,060","\"Homemade noodles are the best,\""]
["07:47,060","07:49,860","\"but I just buy a store brand.\""]
["07:49,860","07:51,780","\"They're the cheapest.\""]
["07:51,780","07:52,620","\"Yeah!\""]
["07:52,620","07:55,740","\"Just put them in the pot.\""]
["07:55,740","07:59,920","\"How will you put them in fiercely or carefully?\""]
["07:59,920","08:00,920","\"Be fierce dude.\""]
["08:00,920","08:05,880","\"You throw everything into the pot as hard as you can, including the box.\""]
["08:05,880","08:07,880","\"It clanks against the empty bottom.\""]
["08:07,880","08:10,160","\"Yeah, I'm into it!\""]
["08:10,160","08:13,920","\"Alright, now it's time to stir the pasta.\""]
["08:13,920","08:17,920","\"As a general rule of thumb, the more you stir, the better it is.\""]
["08:17,920","08:18,920","\"Ready?\""]
["08:18,920","08:19,920","\"Let's do it.\""]
["08:19,920","08:22,920","\"Oh shit, I'm done wearing it.\""]
["08:22,920","08:24,920","\"Stir harder.\""]
["08:24,920","08:26,920","\"*Laughter*\""]
["08:26,920","08:27,920","\"*Screaming*\""]
["08:27,920","08:28,920","\"Holy fuck.\""]
["08:28,920","08:29,920","\"*Laughter*\""]
["08:29,920","08:30,920","\"Let me do it.\""]
["08:30,920","08:31,920","\"Oh my god.\""]
["08:31,920","08:32,920","\"*Laughter*\""]
["08:32,920","08:34,920","\"Did you bent your nice pot?\""]
["08:34,920","08:35,920","\"*Laughter*\""]
["08:35,920","08:36,920","\"That's the stuff.\""]
["08:36,920","08:37,920","\"Alright.\""]
["08:37,920","08:39,920","\"Now for the final step.\""]
["08:39,920","08:40,920","\"Turn up the heat.\""]
["08:40,920","08:43,920","\"Let the stovetop symbolize your passion.\""]
["08:43,920","08:44,920","\"*Whoo!*\""]
["08:44,920","08:47,920","\"Let your hopes and dreams turn into burning fire.\""]
["08:47,920","08:48,920","\"Ready?\""]
["08:48,920","08:50,920","\"Don't hold anything back.\""]
["08:50,920","08:51,920","\"Go to work!\""]
["08:51,920","08:53,920","\"Wait, hold right to turn up the heat.\""]
["08:53,920","08:55,920","\"Yeeeeeeeaaahh\""]
["08:55,920","08:57,400","\"Alright, start up way too hot.\""]
["08:57,400","08:58,400","\"HADDER!\""]
["08:58,400","08:59,400","\"Oh my...\""]
["08:59,400","09:01,400","\"HADDER Darn it!\""]
["09:01,400","09:02,400","\"HADDER!\""]
["09:02,400","09:07,400","\"Wait, that's too...\""]
["09:07,400","09:08,400","\"You nuked her.\""]
["09:08,400","09:09,400","\"Oh no...\""]
["09:09,400","09:12,400","\"She became fish soup?\""]
["09:12,400","09:13,400","\"Ahh...\""]
["09:13,400","09:19,440","\"Man, no wonder papyrus sucks at cooking.\""]
["09:19,440","09:23,280","\"Ah, geez.\""]
["09:23,280","09:26,280","\"So what's next, scrapbooking friendship bracelets?\""]
["09:26,280","09:27,280","\"Oh.\""]
["09:27,280","09:29,480","\"Who am I kidding?\""]
["09:29,480","09:32,200","\"I really screwed this up, didn't I?\""]
["09:32,200","09:34,880","\"I can't force you to like me, human.\""]
["09:34,880","09:37,680","\"Some people just don't get along with each other.\""]
["09:37,680","09:43,960","\"I understand if you feel that way about me, and if we can't be friends, that's okay.\""]
["09:43,960","09:49,360","\"Because if we're not friends, it means I can destroy you without regrets!\""]
["09:49,360","09:50,360","\"What?\""]
