["00:01,600","00:02,800","\"*It disappeared*\""]
["00:02,800","00:05,600","\"*Now I get what happened on the security means*\""]
["00:05,600","00:06,500","\"*That was the-*\""]
["00:06,500","00:09,000","\"Oh wait, can I- I wonder if I can scan them to see them?\""]
["00:09,000","00:10,300","\"Look at that Belinda!\""]
["00:10,300","00:12,300","\"See, Lyle, there's always a new type of hunter.\""]
["00:12,300","00:15,100","\"I don't like that.\""]
["00:15,100","00:16,100","\"*Cute laughter*\""]
["00:16,100","00:17,100","\"*Woo!*\""]
["00:17,100","00:20,800","\"They should have made them look like chameleons or something if you're gonna do that with them.\""]
["00:20,800","00:22,800","\"Like the karma chameleons?\""]
["00:22,800","00:25,600","\"I don't think they would look as intimidating with like a Rango face.\""]
["00:25,600","00:28,600","\"I don't know, I think chameleon heads look creepy.\""]
["00:28,600","00:34,080","\"These are the eyes that like look around in all different directions. They have a million monsters and\""]
["00:34,080","00:37,200","\"Do they really?\""]
["00:37,200","00:41,080","\"So they ripped off a lot. Yeah, they pretty much stole his idea. Sorry, well\""]
["00:41,080","00:48,880","\"So we're in a little bit worthwhile, man. I wish I had like the tolerance level to enjoy monster hunter\""]
["00:48,880","00:55,000","\"What don't you like about it? It you spend 95% of the game in a menu. Oh\""]
["00:55,000","00:58,280","\"Not if you play it\""]
["00:58,280","01:05,840","\"which monster hunter I've tried world oh which people have said is like\""]
["01:05,840","01:10,360","\"actually one of the better ones for that so that's not instilling faith yeah\""]
["01:10,360","01:14,080","\"I actually think monster hunter world lets you too much out of the menu if I'm\""]
["01:14,080","01:19,280","\"being honest that can't be your real opinion I just think it's too easy I\""]
["01:19,280","01:23,600","\"think monster in a world they kind of like dumbed it down a lot oh but I still\""]
["01:23,600","01:27,720","\"think it's a good game the game is like a nine step process if you want to play\""]
["01:27,720","01:29,720","\"with a friend that's really annoying.\""]
["01:29,720","01:31,720","\"Oh, it's not that bad.\""]
["01:31,720","01:33,720","\"It's always bad.\""]
["01:33,720","01:35,720","\"Oh, it's bad.\""]
["01:35,720","01:38,220","\"No, but I genuinely probably would really like that game.\""]
["01:38,220","01:40,220","\"If I could get into it, I just can't get into it.\""]
["01:40,220","01:41,220","\"It is.\""]
["01:41,220","01:44,220","\"There's a little bit of the learning curve is steep.\""]
["01:44,220","01:46,720","\"But once you get past that, it's nothing but fun and thrills\""]
["01:46,720","01:48,720","\"and super good chills.\""]
["01:48,720","01:53,720","\"Yeah, I've kind of found bad UI for me\""]
["01:53,720","01:56,720","\"is a really, really big deal breaker, especially\""]
["01:56,720","01:59,480","\"If it's like an RPG or something this game has badoui\""]
["01:59,480","02:05,520","\"Why don't you pick your little boy? Well, do you your broccoli as a kid your parents just beat the shit out of you both? Oh?\""]
["02:05,520","02:07,840","\"Oh, it's a broccoli out of him\""]
["02:07,840","02:10,760","\"Or into him\""]
["02:10,760","02:16,120","\"I don't know give me broccoli as an excuse because they wanted to beat the shit out of me and then I'd eat it and they'd be like\""]
["02:16,120","02:18,640","\"Fuck is that character?\""]
["02:18,640","02:23,280","\"Is that Naruto guy called broccoli because it's like broccoli. Oh my god\""]
["02:23,800","02:26,800","\"He's stealing the dragon ball method of naming characters\""]
["02:26,800","02:33,800","\"Never thought about it till now. I didn't either. It's probably not it's probably like Bruce Lee. That makes more sense. Oh\""]
["02:33,800","02:40,980","\"Yeah, oh, I didn't even consider that till now. Yeah, that probably is it. That's the more obvious one. Oh\""]
["02:40,980","02:45,240","\"It could be anything that's like you see a character called like wacky Chan. You're like oh\""]
["02:45,240","02:48,440","\"Jackie Chan wacky\""]
["02:49,200","02:55,280","\"You think like Jackie Chun from Dragon Ball? Yeah, exactly. You're like oh, I think that's based on\""]
["02:55,280","03:00,120","\"Wait, no, I lost it. Well, that's like the Street Fighter thing right like originally Balrog\""]
["03:00,120","03:05,320","\"And Bison had opposite names because it was and Bison like Mike Tyson\""]
["03:05,320","03:10,040","\"Oh, yeah, and then they were like we can't do that so they just like switched the names\""]
["03:10,040","03:12,480","\"That's so weird how it worked out\""]
["03:12,480","03:16,440","\"Bison's just a cool like name. Yeah, no, I think it's much better\""]
["03:16,440","03:22,680","\"The only unfortunate thing though is that now if you watch like fighting game footage of Japanese people they saw the original names\""]
["03:22,680","03:25,520","\"Really? Yeah, so it's a whole fuckfest. Oh\""]
["03:25,520","03:31,740","\"Yeah, went do your job. It's a cool name. I would name\""]
["03:31,740","03:36,600","\"Everybody in my life quint if I could I do kind of like this weird bald fuck\""]
["03:36,600","03:42,120","\"He's growing on me. They're just having fun typing on shit\""]
["03:43,640","03:45,640","\"You do some cool dudes\""]
["03:45,640","03:53,440","\"He's just like some guy yeah, we just found some guy to voice him\""]
["03:53,440","03:59,660","\"Editor rewind to the 10 seconds ago in that woman walk by at the start of the scene and zoom in on her beautiful smile\""]
["03:59,660","04:05,280","\"Nice nice one. I love when women are happy me too\""]
["04:05,280","04:11,020","\"I always buy them flowers and listen to them in the first three resident games. They just found randos in Japan\""]
["04:11,760","04:15,860","\"That was smart. I think it worked out. I do too. I love their shitty voices\""]
["04:15,860","04:20,880","\"What's your favorite line from the original resident evil Korea? Well, he says maybe it's\""]
["04:20,880","04:24,440","\"No, that's from the remake. I don't know\""]
["04:24,440","04:27,120","\"Master of unlocking. Here's a lockpick\""]
["04:27,120","04:31,600","\"It might be handy if you the master of unlocking taken with you\""]
["04:31,600","04:36,240","\"Did you know that the um reason that uh Shenmue the voices are like that?\""]
["04:36,240","04:40,160","\"Why is uh because they cast people who looked like the characters\""]
["04:40,160","04:42,680","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:42,680","04:43,520","\"- Really?\""]
["04:43,520","04:45,040","\"- Yeah, that's so cool.\""]
["04:45,040","04:46,840","\"They literally just cast people\""]
["04:46,840","04:49,120","\"who like physically looks like those characters.\""]
["04:49,120","04:51,440","\"- I'm gonna do that, that's a great idea.\""]
["04:51,440","04:54,360","\"- They'll talk like Maroons, dang it.\""]
["04:54,360","04:55,200","\"- Maroons.\""]
["04:55,200","04:57,880","\"- Maroons.\""]
["04:57,880","04:59,240","\"- It's like every time there's a character\""]
["04:59,240","05:00,800","\"with a really, really deep voice,\""]
["05:00,800","05:02,200","\"you look up like who voiced him,\""]
["05:02,200","05:05,320","\"and it's always like this scrawny white dude\""]
["05:05,320","05:06,880","\"that looks like a muppet.\""]
["05:06,880","05:08,520","\"You're like, whoa.\""]
["05:08,520","05:09,400","\"Whoa, huh.\""]
["05:09,400","05:11,400","\"We're in the Mediterranean Sea, guys.\""]
["05:11,400","05:13,660","\"(groaning)\""]
["05:13,660","05:15,920","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:15,920","05:22,440","\"- That's the Mediterranean Greek.\""]
["05:22,440","05:24,780","\"- And his Mediterranean babe.\""]
["05:24,780","05:28,740","\"- Oh god, she knows what she's doing\""]
["05:28,740","05:30,100","\"with her little outfits.\""]
["05:30,100","05:32,440","\"- Right, the one leg exposed.\""]
["05:32,440","05:35,080","\"- She's got like a whole ass cheek out, that's awesome.\""]
["05:35,080","05:37,480","\"- See, it's just enough to keep Chris' adrenaline up.\""]
["05:37,480","05:46,200","\"Wait, look at her. God. She is so cool. Yeah, she's nice. I genuinely like that. It's stupid, but I like it\""]
["05:46,200","05:47,880","\"I feel like Chris should have done it as well. I\""]
["05:47,880","05:52,920","\"Do too that would have evened out and just had like one ball hanging out\""]
["05:52,920","05:57,200","\"I would have liked to see both of his balls hanging out just the whole nut sack. Yeah\""]
["05:57,200","06:00,840","\"She looks like the\""]
["06:00,840","06:04,040","\"Strippedies poster or what you call it showgirls. Oh\""]
["06:04,600","06:10,680","\"Yeah with the lamp. Yeah, she's a lamp woman. So your head looks weird. I love that she's always smiling your little dumbass smile\""]
["06:10,680","06:16,600","\"Time to be a sex model. Oh, you're screwed dude. There's no coming out of this\""]
["06:16,600","06:23,680","\"I do think if you were like a mondo Jack like turbo meathead. Yeah, and there was like a\""]
["06:23,680","06:31,200","\"Hot girl watching you at all times you would be like motivated to do better right. Yeah, I think it actually would work\""]
["06:31,400","06:35,200","\"It's like in the Civil War when they had the little guys with the drums\""]
["06:35,200","06:43,400","\"And that really helped in the war\""]
["06:43,400","06:49,800","\"Enough that they were willing to risk all their lives to do it. So yeah, I really think modern wars should have that kind of shit\""]
["06:49,800","06:54,260","\"Like in my back drummers. Yeah, I think so too like dudes with electric guitars\""]
["06:54,260","07:01,240","\"Or even just a timpani that was so cool. Yeah, like have you seen my max for your road where they got the guitar guys\""]
["07:01,240","07:07,020","\"The truck yeah, that was the coolest thing I ever saw my life. He did look like you made me want to try harder to not die\""]
["07:07,020","07:11,040","\"He was having so much fun. Oh wait. So wait are you Chris Redfield for\""]
["07:11,040","07:14,040","\"Is this modern times?\""]
["07:14,040","07:19,760","\"I'm on the boat to try and rescue you cuz what is it right now Jill and her buddy are drowning I?\""]
["07:19,760","07:28,040","\"Thought Jill was here to rescue you remember they had a fake Chris red. No. No she wish she was and now now the tables are turned\""]
["07:29,560","07:35,080","\"Man, this is like a flashback or something. Oh, no that she's drowning right now with that other guy with the chubby man\""]
["07:35,080","07:41,960","\"That was pretty sick. That was not remember the stab remember your knife\""]
["07:41,960","07:47,980","\"Yeah, do you know if they scaled up the graphics for this or did it look like this on the 3d\""]
["07:47,980","07:53,100","\"I must have scaled yeah, I can't imagine that the 3ds looked I mean it honestly doesn't look too different\""]
["07:53,100","07:58,320","\"It's like you can notice that some things have really sharp edges and that's where like the 3ds is really left into it\""]
["07:58,320","08:04,320","\"And the textures aren't that high res like it does kind of just like look how angular that window is and all this stuff\""]
["08:04,320","08:08,980","\"Like that or the top of Chris's head hmm. Yeah, it's it's a 3ds game, baby\""]
["08:08,980","08:11,800","\"3ds ran at 1p\""]
["08:11,800","08:17,800","\"One pixel night you're thinking of the DS the 3ds ran at 3p\""]
["08:17,800","08:25,000","\"And it let's I remember the Mario 64 port on the DS was so fucking ugly\""]
["08:25,840","08:32,320","\"They made everything piss yellow in it. Yeah, that was my first exposure to Mario 64. That's sad. Sorry. I know\""]
["08:32,320","08:39,420","\"It's a different game like it's totally different. Yeah, it starts you up. It's like Yoshi. Oh, yeah\""]
["08:39,420","08:44,520","\"It does doesn't it you don't even start as Mario. No you have to unlock more horrible idea\""]
["08:44,520","08:49,480","\"You don't have to unlock Mario that can't be true you do have to unlock and you have to be different characters\""]
["08:49,480","08:54,320","\"You use different powerups. I think only Wario could be metal or something. What yeah the metal hat and shit\""]
["08:54,320","08:57,480","\"They don't exist. It's just like one universal power up hat\""]
["08:57,480","09:04,480","\"So Mario gets the flight Luigi gets the invisibility and Wario gets the metal hat and you have to like switch between them\""]
["09:04,480","09:06,640","\"I remember I got Donkey Kong 64 shit\""]
["09:06,640","09:10,320","\"I got all the stars in it the first time played and I was like that was great and then\""]
["09:10,320","09:14,720","\"I was like what not the original slick and I played it and I beat it again. It was better\""]
["09:14,720","09:18,960","\"Yeah, I don't even think that the DS version is bad. It's just weird\""]
["09:20,160","09:25,960","\"Well, I will say it probably did feel pretty fucking amazing playing a full console game one handheld back when that came out\""]
["09:25,960","09:32,000","\"Even if it is worse. Oh man, you know what was the worst how they handled the analog controls you have to like buy it\""]
["09:32,000","09:35,320","\"No, you need to wear this stupid little like thumb\""]
["09:35,320","09:39,440","\"Cap you to wear a little thing on your thumb and you drag it around on the touchscreen\""]
["09:39,440","09:45,960","\"Did like have analog controls and but it didn't keep the analog stick in the same place\""]
["09:45,960","09:51,060","\"Like if you dragged your thumb around the analog stick would also move with you. It was horrible. This is upsetting\""]
["09:51,060","09:54,100","\"I know so I did just use the deep pegs like this is awful. Oh\""]
["09:54,100","09:57,480","\"My god\""]
["09:57,480","10:02,720","\"He cannot have the same amount of health as the first time right oh\""]
["10:02,720","10:09,300","\"Dude, I can't believe it. I thought he was talking and shit. There can't be two oh\""]
["10:09,300","10:14,920","\"Oh, I have to fight them. Oh that oh that sucks. Oh fuck. Oh, it's bad\""]
["10:14,920","10:20,640","\"Oh fuck yourself by coming up here only a little bit\""]
["10:20,640","10:21,900","\"they have a\""]
["10:21,900","10:30,120","\"this is not good baby you're getting owned I don't want to be\""]
["10:30,120","10:36,420","\"me punch him yeah see I punched him Chris well you want to go to a casino tonight\""]
["10:36,420","10:43,360","\"and win big I would win big you probably would you fucker you put like a\""]
["10:43,360","10:45,960","\"I'm gonna nickel into a fucking slaw machine and win like a million dollars\""]
["10:45,960","10:52,820","\"Maybe I can see Lyle doing that Lyle if you think about it if both of us do it we increase the rods times too\""]
["10:52,820","10:58,240","\"There is a 100% chance of winning at the casino if you just go with a hundred people\""]
["10:58,240","11:02,000","\"I went where you're right. I went with\""]
["11:02,000","11:04,200","\"me and\""]
["11:04,200","11:09,100","\"Ben and Adam we were doing a road trip through the country and we got to one of those\""]
["11:09,100","11:11,640","\"Indian casinos and\""]
["11:11,640","11:15,880","\"We went into it and when I walked in I literally said to Adam\""]
["11:15,880","11:19,520","\"as like Adam they're watching us on a camera right now and\""]
["11:19,520","11:24,380","\"if like we look like a bunch of stupid kids so they're gonna make\""]
["11:24,380","11:29,080","\"Probably all three of us win instantly so that we get hooked so once we win\""]
["11:29,080","11:33,000","\"We're gonna we're gonna take the money and walk out. He's okay\""]
["11:33,000","11:37,400","\"Like and that's good logic right yeah, we all fucking won\""]
["11:38,240","11:42,520","\"Literally we all won like like a $50 or something instantly. I was like okay\""]
["11:42,520","11:47,720","\"Let's go and then as we were walking out Adam fucking wasted all of the money and he lost it all and more\""]
["11:47,720","11:53,680","\"Because he wouldn't fucking listen. He's like no dude. I'm gonna rule dude. It's like fucking told you what's gonna happen you fool\""]
["11:53,680","12:00,080","\"You're a smart man Chris. I feel like that is the only time that will ever fucking work in my life\""]
["12:00,080","12:03,520","\"Yeah, and you you well Adam squandered it\""]
["12:04,440","12:08,940","\"Did you at least keep your money? Yeah, I think I won I won a little bit I won like\""]
["12:08,940","12:12,340","\"$30 he won more than me and I think Ben wants some to\""]
["12:12,340","12:16,420","\"They just make you win a little bit. So you're like oh hey, I'm gonna roll\""]
["12:16,420","12:23,220","\"Do you think free money then you lose it all? Yeah, basically this guy look cute to you Chris\""]
["12:23,220","12:28,140","\"What's this problem? What's in him?\""]
["12:28,140","12:31,140","\"What a dumbass?\""]
["12:31,800","12:35,420","\"Oh shit, I do love them. The enemies in this game are funny\""]
["12:35,420","12:40,400","\"They're cool. They're little sea enemies. Here's a weird question\""]
["12:40,400","12:46,220","\"I'm a fuck do they vet the guys that they hire in casinos as like blackjack dealers\""]
["12:46,220","12:49,640","\"If they're scummy and we'll fuck you over the higher them\""]
["12:49,640","12:54,540","\"Maybe okay, okay hypothetical scenario, right? Mm-hmm\""]
["12:54,540","12:58,880","\"They hire me as a blackjack dealer. Yeah, and you come into the casino\""]
["12:59,600","13:03,040","\"Like who's to say that I can't just like have you win a bunch?\""]
["13:03,040","13:10,420","\"If you did that they would probably be illegal, but like how would they know you look into it? They'd be like I\""]
["13:10,420","13:14,180","\"Don't know they've got they've got scary like records and shit\""]
["13:14,180","13:18,200","\"I don't know what I mean like they strap a bomb to your leg and every single guy\""]
["13:18,200","13:22,280","\"Against everyone who wins at his table and make sure that they don't know each other\""]
["13:22,280","13:27,040","\"But it's a bit over a certain amount. They'd be like what are you fucking doing?\""]
["13:27,560","13:29,560","\"Why did you do that?\""]
