["03:03,480","03:04,480","\"Originally the game was called pikeman.\""]

["05:05,620","05:09,180","\"What's the right order to be missing your teeth?\""]
["05:09,180","05:13,740","\"Well, it was like you got his teeth missing a tooth has a tooth missing a tooth\""]
["05:13,740","05:19,260","\"It was like there was such big gaps between his teeth. Yeah, so he can clamp his mouth down further\""]
["05:19,260","05:21,260","\"than most people can\""]
["05:21,260","05:24,780","\"It was an episode of Keenan and Kelle where they kept doing close-up shots of his face\""]
["05:24,780","05:27,980","\"It was really zitty and I turned off the TV as a young boy\""]
["05:27,980","05:33,340","\"You got scared just wanted to you just want to grab his face and squeezes hard as you could\""]

["05:39,020","05:41,020","\"So you you would like run out of the room\""]
["05:41,020","05:45,300","\"Not run out. I the only time ever did that was with Final Fantasy 7\""]
["05:45,300","05:52,020","\"Was at the beginning of the game when the when the timer was going off right before the city exploded\""]
["05:52,020","05:54,020","\"I turned off the PlayStation run out crying\""]

["06:31,580","06:34,380","\"They improved on the gameplay a lot\""]
["06:34,380","06:41,500","\"But I think it's a little too fantastical. I like when I like this game being very sort of grounded in reality\""]
["06:41,500","06:52,380","\"There was a plane full of chance Julian I got shot down do you think they'd survive no\""]
["06:52,380","06:55,620","\"Why not?\""]

["07:10,580","07:13,580","\"Why did they shoot it down?\""]
["07:13,580","07:17,980","\"Because one of the chimps was making serious threats to who?\""]
["07:17,980","07:20,700","\"girls online\""]
["07:22,700","07:25,440","\"- Silly found a plane and shot it down.\""]
