["12:37,380","12:46,980","\"I wouldn't call it covering tracks. I just call it like not letting the entire world go to shit\""]
["12:46,980","12:53,080","\"This is always the plot. This is always the plot of like every single zombie thing. It's like well, we fucked up time to nuke everything\""]
["12:53,080","13:00,500","\"Why don't they just say like dang you know what let's just conceal everything and then like free it in another part of the world\""]
["13:00,500","13:02,100","\"What?\""]
["13:02,100","13:04,100","\"That would be different. It would be different\""]
["13:04,100","13:08,500","\"That would be like if that would be like saying that like when the Japanese people were fucking about some world\""]
["13:08,500","13:11,960","\"Or two like let's just take off the Japanese people put somewhere else like can't fuck with us though\""]
["13:11,960","13:17,520","\"I mean, why didn't they think it? Why did you think of that? Why do you end their lives instead of just moving them to a different location?\""]
["13:17,520","13:19,440","\"Why didn't you think of that?\""]
["13:19,440","13:23,720","\"Here's the thing if there were zombies attacking you put them all in\""]
["13:23,720","13:29,200","\"Side of one of those fucking traveling crates that they used to carry massive boxes from overseas\""]

["13:33,760","13:38,840","\"Anyways pick that up drop it in Antarctica. There you go problem solved\""]
["13:38,840","13:41,660","\"What the fuck is gonna happen when you release a zombie in Antarctica?\""]
["13:41,660","13:44,500","\"It's just gonna freeze the dead have you seen return to the living dead?\""]
["13:44,500","13:46,160","\"Yeah, at the end of that movie\""]
["13:46,160","13:51,480","\"They knew the place but then all their ashes flap in the air and it turns into acid rain and it starts raining zombie juice down\""]
["13:51,480","13:56,140","\"And the world still shit. Exactly. That's why you contain everything\""]
["13:56,140","13:58,480","\"Drop it in an antarctic location\""]
["13:58,480","14:04,240","\"Sure, it'll kill and mang everything there, but at least it'll be concentrated in a cold area\""]
["14:04,240","14:08,580","\"And then it won't spread because when it's cold it'll slow the process of\""]
["14:08,580","14:15,380","\"Ronnie. I was really sad that uh the return of the Living Dead's theme song isn't isolated anywhere\""]
["14:15,380","14:20,880","\"What do you mean like you can't just download the song and it's so and there's always like sound effects on top of it\""]
["14:20,880","14:24,520","\"Really maybe the song was built with sound effects on top of it. It's possible\""]
["14:24,520","14:26,960","\"Like a really really good song\""]
["14:26,960","14:33,000","\"Return of living did is a great movie return to living dad's my favorite zombie movie probably it's pretty good\""]
["14:33,000","14:37,480","\"Funest zombie movie ever made yeah, I think the worst zombie movie probably landed with that\""]
["14:37,480","14:41,280","\"I that's fucking boring. I hate it so much. It's by George Romero\""]
["14:41,280","14:47,520","\"Yeah, but it's like it's like action in like stupid like the zombies. It's just such a dumb\""]
["14:47,520","14:50,360","\"Yeah, sorry. It's just such a dumb fucking idea\""]
["14:50,360","14:52,800","\"What is it? I've never seen it\""]
["14:52,800","14:56,200","\"I'll give you the basic gist of it. It's like people\""]
["14:56,200","14:59,640","\"The world is an outbreak. It's like chaos\""]
["14:59,640","15:04,120","\"So they have this like island for rich people and the poor people\""]

["15:09,960","15:17,360","\"Zombies start becoming smarter and like learning how to use like rockets and all this other bullshit\""]
["15:17,360","15:20,960","\"And they basically just gain the knowledge to\""]
["15:20,960","15:28,080","\"Infiltrate this place and kill everybody and then at the very end after they kill everybody\""]
["15:28,280","15:33,880","\"They're just like they're just gonna go their merry way now that they're satisfied because they ain't and killed enough people\""]
["15:33,880","15:38,160","\"Then they just go on they nod to the zombies and the zombies go off to kill more people\""]
["15:38,160","15:43,520","\"What that sucks? I'm tough. It's true. That's the ending. I think the original day of the dead is really good\""]
["15:43,520","15:49,520","\"And I like the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the dead is like such a sorrowful movie\""]
["15:49,520","15:51,520","\"We just feel sorry for everybody\""]
["15:51,520","15:57,960","\"It's so sad because you just the ending is just a kick in the nuts. It's such a hopeless movie that you're just like\""]
["15:57,960","16:00,560","\"Damn, this is sad man. Like it's just like it's rough\""]
["16:00,560","16:05,260","\"It's what would happen really if you were a fucking the militia in a zombie outbreak your fuck you\""]
["16:05,260","16:12,440","\"But the remake of it's like they got like bloody nose is it can climb up walls and they're like spiders on me\""]
["16:12,440","16:15,320","\"I haven't seen the remake at the end of it. It is so dumb\""]
["16:15,320","16:18,880","\"It's so weird that the guy who fucking made the genre sucks now\""]
["16:18,880","16:20,760","\"He just can't write it\""]
["16:20,760","16:26,900","\"He tries to like over he tries to make the next one more bombastic and he's like no these zombies need to be able to have snorkels\""]
["16:26,900","16:31,540","\"and braille under water. It's like why? What the fuck is the point? It's like these\""]
["16:31,540","16:35,940","\"zombies need to be smart and not to use the elevator and use cars. It's like no?\""]
["16:35,940","16:40,580","\"I mean yeah that would be scary but at the same time it's dumb. I miss the idea of\""]
