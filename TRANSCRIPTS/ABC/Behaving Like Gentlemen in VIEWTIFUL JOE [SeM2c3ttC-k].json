["17:45,140","17:47,140","\"knocking it over on her and she dies instantly.\""]

["17:51,140","17:52,140","\"Yeah, the end.\""]
["17:52,140","17:54,140","\"Oh, fucking...\""]
["17:54,140","17:57,400","\"This game is fucking hard by the way.\""]
["17:57,400","17:58,400","\"It's ruthless.\""]
["17:58,400","18:00,200","\"I do not remember being this hard.\""]
["18:00,200","18:04,240","\"You probably played it on kid mode and you got like one extra hit each time.\""]
["18:04,240","18:06,000","\"That shit's crazy.\""]
["18:06,000","18:10,280","\"I feel like everybody's got like too much health and it is pretty nuts.\""]
["18:10,280","18:13,840","\"That's what you do when you knock the barrel in the air Chris or Lyle.\""]
["18:13,840","18:16,640","\"This how games used to be Lyle.\""]
["18:16,640","18:17,640","\"Games were hard.\""]
["18:17,640","18:18,640","\"Don't you remember?\""]
["18:18,640","18:20,560","\"You know this game reminds me of what?\""]
["18:20,560","18:21,560","\"Oh, Tommy.\""]
["18:21,560","18:22,560","\"That's what it reminds me of.\""]
["18:22,560","18:23,560","\"Commer made O'Kami.\""]
["18:23,560","18:29,700","\"Yeah, so yeah, I mean it makes sense, but it's like this style the cell shade style is very old comedy\""]
["18:29,700","18:33,460","\"Like although I feel like this one has more obviously the comic book aesthetic\""]
["18:33,460","18:39,760","\"Was a comic good. Yeah, it was really good. I mean never played it. No, it's like the best Zelda game\""]
["18:39,760","18:43,260","\"That's not a Zelda game. It's like a wolf. It's extremely slow though\""]
["18:43,260","18:49,380","\"It's yeah, when I remember the part where you have to like find you have to like hunt all these like wolf spirits\""]
["18:49,960","18:52,680","\"- Oh, I see what I have to do.\""]
["18:52,680","19:01,200","\"Yes, yes, good job. I believe that we live in a time where save states should be allowed in every game ever released period\""]
["19:01,200","19:05,720","\"Because that's what fucking saving is in the current era you can fucking save anywhere\""]
["19:05,720","19:09,920","\"I don't know. You know what? I don't actually like that. I don't like being able to save scum\""]
["19:09,920","19:13,740","\"I think games should just give you fair checkpoints, and that's it. You know what? That's true\""]
["19:13,740","19:18,960","\"I felt like Halo was one of those games that really mastered checkpoints every time I played Halo\""]
["19:18,960","19:22,820","\"It was always like I just got passed apart and it's like checkpoint. You're just like cool\""]
["19:22,820","19:27,920","\"Yeah, but then like you play games, you know, it's a different type of game, right like Dark Souls\""]
["19:27,920","19:31,040","\"It's the fireplaces and you know that that's the kind of game it is\""]
["19:31,040","19:38,200","\"But also I feel like you could beat that whole game with like nothing, but this game there's so much fighting that it like wears you out\""]
["19:38,200","19:40,600","\"You can't just like\""]
["19:40,600","19:44,220","\"Dodger all through enemies and then run to the next room like you kind of have to do this\""]
["19:44,220","19:49,640","\"Just came down easy like Dark Souls. I honestly do God you start running\""]
["19:49,640","19:53,480","\"Speed of the puma\""]
["19:53,480","19:58,940","\"Oh, dude, you have to hit the oh Jesus. Oh, oh\""]
["19:58,940","20:01,640","\"Yeah, never mind\""]
["20:01,640","20:08,380","\"A cool scene where you just had to like keep grabbing like for like liquid and stuff beat the puddies. Oh\""]
["20:08,380","20:13,180","\"Yeah, they do kind of look like those crazy rascals don't they yeah?\""]
["20:13,260","20:18,640","\"What are putties from the power Rangers guys they look like foot soldiers made by a curator yama\""]
["20:18,640","20:25,720","\"It's still stand by that it looks like me by curator yama. I feel like this is kind of based on like old Japanese like\""]
["20:25,720","20:30,840","\"Sentai yeah, I know it's absolutely sentai he's like he's like\""]
["20:30,840","20:35,640","\"Pointy thing is super sentai and then when he did his hand gesture. That's like sentai rangers\""]
["20:35,640","20:41,680","\"I mean sentai is just this it's like power Rangers is I don't know how they did power rangers\""]
["20:41,680","20:46,100","\"I remember watching a documentary. I don't know if it was like two shows mixed into one or it was just yeah\""]
["20:46,100","20:50,080","\"The part where there were teenagers with attitude that was like America America\""]
["20:50,080","20:53,400","\"And then when it was like the Japanese stuff that was when they had the suits on in another place\""]
["20:53,400","20:57,340","\"But for them Power Rangers movie they actually like filmed\""]
["20:57,340","21:04,940","\"The power Rangers stuff again. I didn't watch power Rangers. I didn't really either. I just I just knew that yeah\""]
["21:04,940","21:11,300","\"You also didn't watch power Rangers. I feel like that was like there was like a generation where I remember I had\""]
["21:11,300","21:16,900","\"Excuse me. I had a red Rangers doll, but I just had it. I'm like, why do I have this?\""]
["21:16,900","21:19,900","\"I don't even like this. See I like the part where they were the power Rangers\""]
["21:19,900","21:22,740","\"But I didn't like the part where they were teenagers with attitude. Isn't that lame?\""]
["21:22,740","21:26,220","\"Yeah, even then when I was a kid, I'm like, why do I care about these like adults?\""]
["21:26,220","21:31,100","\"Doing like high school shit. I don't know if it just didn't think that you were gonna do that\""]
["21:31,100","21:35,020","\"Well, you did and I would have done the same thing. Oh, you light them\""]
["21:35,020","21:41,020","\"That's cool. Like how fast you're going. You're so frictiony. Well, you're really quick\""]
["21:41,020","21:43,020","\"Did you know that you're like fast?\""]
["21:43,020","21:45,020","\"Well, it's my most frictiony friend.\""]
["21:45,020","21:48,020","\"It's good to know. What am I? You're most slippery?\""]
["21:48,020","21:49,020","\"You're m-\""]
["21:49,020","21:50,020","\"Mmm.\""]
["21:50,020","21:51,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["21:51,020","21:52,020","\"You're kind of slippery.\""]
["21:52,020","21:54,020","\"I would call you more of a like...\""]
["21:54,020","21:56,020","\"Disheveled slippery mess.\""]
["21:56,020","22:00,020","\"With our powers combined, we are appropriately grippy.\""]
