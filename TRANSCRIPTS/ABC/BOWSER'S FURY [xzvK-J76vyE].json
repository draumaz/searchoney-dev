["01:24,500","01:27,100","\"Charlie's with Martini Mario.\""]
["01:27,100","01:29,300","\"I was just kidding.\""]

["02:25,420","02:28,780","\"Huh, what's he doing?\""]
["02:28,780","02:35,860","\"It's just been a dick. Oh, maybe maybe it was just rumors. Uh-oh. I could have sworn it was like Joseph Gordon Levitt or something was\""]
["02:35,860","02:41,740","\"Moisting Luigi. I wish it was Joseph Gordon. Love it. I was Zoe Deschanel voice Mario. No, it's good\""]

["03:09,500","03:12,140","\"That's a cool little sprite\""]
["03:12,140","03:14,860","\"There he is\""]
["03:14,860","03:17,520","\"Man, that's so lazy, but it looks very fluid\""]
["03:17,520","03:25,040","\"Imagine if that was you if you saw a picture of that someone showed you that and was like look at yourself\""]
["03:25,040","03:27,520","\"What you mean Bowser?\""]
["03:27,520","03:30,640","\"Yeah, like if if if if you\""]
["03:30,640","03:36,400","\"Were in a really really bad mood and someone took a picture of you and showed you it and it looked like that\""]
["03:36,400","03:40,600","\"And they were like do you realize this is what you look like to other people when you do this?\""]
["03:40,600","03:46,080","\"I just feel like what I would say the same thing. I'm saying right now. What the fuck are you talking about?\""]
["03:46,800","03:53,500","\"Look go inside the lighthouse. There's a weird thing where if I try walking slowly still like does that but if you walk quickly\""]

["05:00,080","05:02,080","\"Wait, why didn't he just talk in the first place then?\""]
["05:02,080","05:04,080","\"Mario, this is like you punk ass.\""]
["05:04,080","05:13,080","\"I don't trust this kid. He's too big and mad. I can't change dad back by myself.\""]
["05:13,080","05:22,400","\"He's been corrupted by the Mario cynical. I never ask you for help, never ever. Don't\""]
["05:22,400","05:29,280","\"do anything to save Piappa. So help me. I see you guys have empathy, you're on my\""]
["05:29,280","05:34,280","\"He's good now.\""]
["05:34,280","05:40,280","\"His brush turned from black to some sort of neon thing.\""]
["05:40,280","05:41,280","\"Put a little.\""]
["05:41,280","05:42,280","\"How much help?\""]
["05:42,280","05:43,280","\"None.\""]
["05:43,280","05:44,280","\"Alrighty.\""]
["05:44,280","05:45,280","\"Alrighty.\""]
["05:45,280","05:50,280","\"It's been done.\""]
["05:50,280","05:53,280","\"This is the best thing you could possibly do.\""]
["05:53,280","05:57,280","\"In my realm.\""]
["05:57,280","06:02,220","\"Oh, how'd you become little so fast? I fucking fell in the black paint\""]
["06:02,220","06:07,460","\"You can't do that that you Bowser Jr. Probably sat down\""]
["06:07,460","06:14,060","\"Did you see the new horrible smash reveal that everyone literally fucking hated? What was it? It was a fucking Xenoblade character\""]
["06:14,060","06:20,820","\"Oh, yeah, yeah, like literally nobody outside of Japan would ever care about a new Xenoblade character\""]
["06:20,820","06:24,420","\"I don't know if anybody yeah inside of Japan necessarily does\""]
["06:24,420","06:29,220","\"To say it feels sometimes like it's just for the ego of the guys that have created these more new games\""]
["06:29,220","06:34,340","\"And they're like well, we're first party Nintendo so it's probably and we're here at the office\""]
["06:34,340","06:39,660","\"And so you should probably appreciate our characters more. It's like nobody cares about Xenoblade\""]
["06:39,660","06:45,820","\"I mean, I think it's just integrated advertising really what is going on here? That's the most simple explanation for it\""]
["06:45,820","06:48,980","\"my problem with Xenoblade like I\""]
["06:49,780","06:56,380","\"Get the appeal like I like those kinds of games like the big action RPGs like the open world action RPGs\""]
["06:56,380","07:03,180","\"But something about Xenoblade has never quite clicked with me where like I never really care about the world of the characters\""]
["07:03,180","07:06,100","\"I did have you seen like the actual reveal for it?\""]
["07:06,100","07:11,840","\"It just seemed like really really lazy like it was the most like compared with Cephra\""]
["07:11,840","07:15,420","\"Yeah, like that was the best fucking reveal ever and then right after that\""]
["07:15,420","07:17,780","\"It's like the worst fucking reveal ever. It's just really weird\""]
["07:17,780","07:22,840","\"Maybe that's why they picked now to do it because everyone was feeling so good about Cepharot still\""]
["07:22,840","07:24,840","\"They're like we could really get away with anything\""]
["07:24,840","07:32,040","\"Take our weakest character we had left to reveal and do it now. Yeah cepharos seemed like a preemptive apology\""]
["07:32,040","07:37,820","\"Right because you already will are willing to forgive them because Cepharot\""]
["07:37,820","07:41,520","\"Yeah, I knew there was no way that it was gonna be two good ones in a row\""]
["07:41,520","07:43,520","\"It was just not gonna happen\""]
["07:43,520","07:45,560","\"Yeah, I guess this game is more of like a\""]
["07:46,280","07:50,520","\"It's like it's like almost a throwback to Mario Sunshine\""]
["07:50,520","07:53,440","\"You know without any of its core game mechanics\""]
["07:53,440","07:57,360","\"It's fine by me. You like the mung shooter. I\""]
["07:57,360","08:05,920","\"Mean I don't miss it. No, but it was it's cool for that game, but I wouldn't want it back the lighthouse wants to bring something to light\""]
["08:05,920","08:09,700","\"The spotchy goople vanish into the light of a catch shine\""]
["08:09,700","08:13,240","\"If you can't find one try looking at another island\""]
["08:13,240","08:16,240","\"Okay\""]
["08:16,240","08:20,120","\"Does each pile of goop need a certain amount of cat shines?\""]
["08:20,120","08:27,480","\"Yes, cuz with shot shine sprites was a term specifically from I guess I got over there now\""]
["08:27,480","08:31,740","\"Bye from that Mario right can I just fly forever? Yeah?\""]
["08:31,740","08:36,100","\"Wait, where are you okay? I can return to you\""]
["08:36,100","08:40,560","\"Uh-huh. It's a giga bell. I heard a cool thing about these\""]
["08:40,560","08:44,360","\"I think it was when the beast rises the giga bell will ring or some shit\""]
["08:44,800","08:46,900","\"Maybe we got to get this blotchy goop up\""]
["08:46,900","08:49,160","\"Yeah, okay\""]
["08:49,160","08:51,160","\"We got to go over heat\""]
["08:51,160","08:59,100","\"If they did a reveal for smash and it was Mike Matei's gadget it would probably be the coolest thing ever I'd laugh\""]
["08:59,100","09:03,420","\"Mike Matei's inspector gadget\""]
["09:03,420","09:11,000","\"Copyright unenforceable. It would be so funny. They should do that or they should do Homer and Peter Griffin in the same reveal\""]
["09:11,280","09:14,760","\"That would be awesome. I think that would actually hype people to fuck up\""]
["09:14,760","09:21,440","\"So if you got the bring it a Homer and Peter Griffin both choice that I would fucking scream in the light\""]
["09:21,440","09:26,780","\"I'm sick of Nintendo characters. It's always Nintendo obviously. It's for picking shitty ones\""]
["09:26,780","09:32,080","\"I think that one is a Nintendo character. I think that's the only reason why they know they have not\""]
["09:32,080","09:35,720","\"Created in iconic character in like a decade or two\""]
["09:35,960","09:41,680","\"They should have gotten the metal slug guy. It's like who was the last like all the all the recent iconic\""]
["09:41,680","09:46,300","\"Nintendo characters have just been additions to like Mario or Zelda I\""]
["09:46,300","09:53,380","\"Think they could have gotten Chrono trigger guy. They could have done Eggman. You mean Chrono. Yeah\""]
["09:53,380","10:00,920","\"See our metal Sonic that'd be cool. Yeah, I know I'd rather get an Eggman or a metal Sonic or Tails or Knuckles\""]
["10:00,920","10:05,960","\"I mean, I'm still like they won't put tails or knuckles in because they put him in his trophies already\""]
["10:05,960","10:09,000","\"I still think Gino would be a good one\""]
["10:09,000","10:12,320","\"Yeah, no every yeah Gino would be pretty cool\""]
["10:12,320","10:14,840","\"Gino I I\""]
["10:14,840","10:22,680","\"Know it becomes more obscure the law the further we get from you know the 20 year ago release of Super Mario RPG, but\""]
["10:22,680","10:27,400","\"Nobody would be upset about that. I just can't imagine it\""]
["10:27,400","10:32,480","\"I mean if this were like purely about like the characters they'd probably put like crash bandicoot. They\""]
["10:32,480","10:35,440","\"Really think it crashed would get in\""]
["10:35,440","10:36,400","\"Oh\""]
["10:36,400","10:42,400","\"Like there's some that I would want that I just like there's probably no chance in hell like Master Chief or Kratos or something\""]
["10:42,400","10:44,400","\"Like there's no way they would do\""]
["10:44,400","10:48,400","\"Like Dante would be a good one. I thought they would be great\""]
["10:48,400","10:54,000","\"Fucking I was thinking like couldn't they do at this point doesn't Microsoft to have like\""]
["10:54,560","10:58,020","\"Or does Bungie still own the rights to Master Chief?\""]
["10:58,020","10:59,280","\"No, Microsoft does.\""]
["10:59,280","11:02,760","\"And they put Banjo in, which Microsoft also owns the rights to.\""]
["11:02,760","11:04,800","\"I suppose they end Minecraft.\""]
["11:04,800","11:05,460","\"Yep.\""]
["11:05,460","11:10,760","\"So they feasibly could do-- what's his name?\""]
["11:10,760","11:11,360","\"They could.\""]
["11:11,360","11:12,960","\"I'm not sure if they would.\""]
["11:12,960","11:13,920","\"Yeah, Master Chief.\""]
["11:13,920","11:14,420","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:14,420","11:16,280","\"I know I'm stupid for wanting that one,\""]
["11:16,280","11:17,360","\"but I want that one.\""]
["11:17,360","11:19,000","\"I don't think you're stupid for wanting that.\""]
["11:19,000","11:24,440","\"I think Solid Snake is all alone as the modern fighter\""]
["11:24,440","11:28,640","\"guy in that game I don't think it could hurt to have another one I want to yeah I want to see them\""]
["11:28,640","11:33,000","\"actually try to tackle a character from a first person shooter like I want to see how they would\""]
["11:33,000","11:38,080","\"actually do it because they usually bring in mechanics that kind of like work with the game\""]
["11:38,080","11:42,120","\"that they're bringing the character from I don't think I would hope they bring the sticky grenade I\""]
["11:42,120","11:47,080","\"think that would be one of the best thing oh yeah or the doom guy the doom guy would also be cool\""]
["11:47,080","11:52,080","\"oh yeah be a master chief you could definitely make him play like something between like Mega Man\""]
["11:52,080","11:55,840","\"and snake would be like a good, a good way to do that.\""]
["11:55,840","11:57,880","\"But yeah, I don't know, that one's stupid.\""]
["11:57,880","11:59,160","\"Phoenix Wright would be a good one,\""]
["11:59,160","12:01,200","\"O'Kami would be a good one.\""]
["12:01,200","12:03,360","\"- I'd love Phoenix Wright just because it would mean\""]
["12:03,360","12:05,280","\"they could add the music into the can.\""]
["12:05,280","12:06,840","\"- Yeah, that'd be sick.\""]
["12:06,840","12:07,920","\"You're showing me all the music.\""]
["12:07,920","12:10,120","\"- I was gonna say I still have a very big soft spot\""]
["12:10,120","12:13,640","\"for the music of the original trilogy.\""]
["12:13,640","12:15,120","\"- Yeah, it's real good.\""]
["12:15,120","12:16,920","\"Oh, there's another one over here.\""]
["12:16,920","12:20,000","\"There's that like, I don't know if it's like the group\""]
["12:20,000","12:25,000","\"whatever like the cadenza yeah album I like the cadenza one I like the\""]
["12:25,000","12:29,240","\"orchestra one I think the best though the Phoenix meets orchestra and there's\""]
