["48:21,940","48:29,320","\"To the Sun and a black hole, but then she like combines with the Sun. It becomes like a demon monster. She becomes mega Maria\""]

["48:59,740","49:01,420","\"- So here's the thing, he's breaking up\""]
["49:01,420","49:03,500","\"in the atmosphere, his legs and arms are breaking up.\""]
["49:03,500","49:04,500","\"- He's screaming.\""]
["49:04,500","49:05,660","\"(laughing)\""]
["49:05,660","49:08,100","\"- And screaming, if only I had some rings.\""]
["49:08,100","49:10,940","\"- Luckily, he learned to put in one lone ring,\""]
["49:10,940","49:12,420","\"which looks safe, some from death.\""]
["49:12,420","49:13,420","\"- Oh, yeah, exactly.\""]
["49:13,420","49:15,020","\"- That's how Maria lived too.\""]

["49:17,220","49:18,220","\"- No, no, no, no.\""]
["49:18,220","49:20,620","\"Now when he looks up, he sees Maria's head in the sky,\""]

["49:22,980","49:23,820","\"- Oh my God.\""]
["49:23,820","49:31,260","\"Yes, that mega Maria's coming to earth yes, and is there a day like there's a day in my\""]
["49:31,260","49:35,080","\"And he has to collect the Maria stones to fire into her with a cannon\""]
["49:35,080","49:41,380","\"That's her timer so first of all Eggman has to meet up with shadow. That's level one. Mm-hmm. You're running the shot\""]

["50:00,320","50:03,600","\"And how do you do that?\""]
["50:03,600","50:08,980","\"Shoot zone and did that's a level that's the first level. Yeah, but choose zone\""]
["50:08,980","50:16,240","\"And then when you finally get to his door he goes hmm you again, huh? Yeah, huh?\""]
["50:16,680","50:20,120","\"Kill my girlfriend did you huh, and he lets you in\""]
["50:20,120","50:35,400","\"He goes what are you doing here huh, and then Eggman opens the blinds really quick and the light pours in\""]
["50:35,400","50:38,320","\"Shutter walks over the light and it's like the camera pans up\""]

["51:02,040","51:03,360","\"(laughing)\""]
["51:03,360","51:06,080","\"Anyway, shadow sees Maria.\""]
["51:06,080","51:08,000","\"He puts the gun to his head\""]
["51:08,000","51:10,080","\"and shoots his brain out of his head.\""]
["51:10,080","51:10,920","\"- Why?\""]
["51:10,920","51:12,320","\"Because he can't comprehend.\""]
["51:12,320","51:14,240","\"But he also was holding a ring.\""]
["51:14,240","51:16,920","\"And then it goes, OK, now that I thought about a little bit more,\""]
["51:16,920","51:18,240","\"I don't actually want to do this.\""]

["54:42,760","54:45,240","\"How are dean screen machine?\""]
["54:45,240","54:50,280","\"They start firing of bean particles at each other through the large be drawn collider\""]

["55:10,980","55:14,420","\"The why did you take out this very convoluted part?\""]
["55:14,420","55:15,980","\"Oh shit, I ain't saying that\""]
["55:15,980","55:17,280","\"It's on the outside you're saying\""]
["55:17,280","55:20,180","\"You must defeat my beautiful Maria\""]
["55:20,180","55:23,320","\"And you're spinning around over and over and over and it's like kind of like DDR\""]
["55:23,320","55:25,320","\"And you have to stop on your control\""]
["55:25,320","55:28,180","\"Can you give me a sample of the main theme because it has to play the main theme during this\""]
["55:28,180","55:29,740","\"You're gonna be fighting Mega Maria.\""]
["55:29,740","55:32,160","\"Okay, so it's kind of like industrial,\""]
["55:32,160","55:33,820","\"'cause it's Dr. Robotnik, so it's like...\""]
["55:33,820","55:36,160","\"(beatboxing)\""]
["55:36,160","55:40,900","\"See, that's pretty cool.\""]

["55:54,260","55:57,240","\"It's kind of like \"\"Wonewe\"\" and \"\"Angel\"\", it's really epic.\""]
["55:57,240","55:59,240","\"I believe you do you have a choir behind it.\""]
["55:59,240","56:01,240","\"Yeah, there's a choir of uh...\""]

["56:12,240","56:14,240","\"Anyway, so...\""]
["56:14,240","56:16,240","\"You're a good Christian!\""]
["56:16,240","56:18,240","\"Just a little detail that needs to be in there.\""]
["56:18,240","56:23,240","\"Because you spent, you have to do 999 spins and they all take a minute each.\""]
["56:23,240","56:25,240","\"So it's really epic.\""]
["56:25,240","56:30,760","\"Anyway, once you hit the final spin, Sonic runs in and he starts running on your cake.\""]
["56:30,760","56:31,760","\"Again?\""]

["56:41,760","56:42,760","\"It's called final cake.\""]
["56:42,760","56:43,760","\"It's really cool.\""]
["56:43,760","56:44,760","\"That sounds like a Sonic level.\""]
["56:44,760","56:46,240","\"Yeah, it works.\""]
["56:46,240","56:49,960","\"So Shadow is eating the cake outside the master emerald.\""]
["56:49,960","56:50,960","\"Sonic runs on it.\""]
["56:50,960","56:51,960","\"Oh, well, okay.\""]

["56:55,720","56:58,840","\"\"\"Gah! You always do this!\"\"\""]
["56:58,840","57:02,440","\"And then Sonic Lalls and kick Shadow to death.\""]
["57:02,440","57:09,480","\"Which calls him the fall on the lever which actually stops the master emerald from spinning,\""]

["57:22,040","57:24,640","\"And it's so funny that Shadow also pukes.\""]

["57:26,560","57:28,200","\"They all start, yeah.\""]

["57:30,680","57:31,600","\"- Oh my god.\""]
["57:31,600","57:34,760","\"- The whole planet is surrounded by a thin layer of puke.\""]
["57:34,760","57:36,160","\"- And then they make the camera roll.\""]
["57:36,160","57:38,080","\"- And they protect Shadow Platic.\""]
["57:38,080","57:39,680","\"- Oh, they form a new ozone layer.\""]

["57:50,400","58:18,400","\"I don't think Sega's gonna take this idea. I don't know something about it. How much far is that away from the ending?

["59:01,520","59:05,620","\"I need to actually figure out how to destroy them. So shadow\""]
["59:05,620","59:13,420","\"Mentioned that 9/11 happened so maybe they can use that to their advantage. I'm imagining there's just like a child babbling\""]
["59:13,520","59:17,820","\"He got into their office somehow. He got into the board room. Wait a minute. Shadow's dead\""]
["59:17,820","59:22,580","\"Anyway, is he yeah, he died earlier sonic kicked him to death on the ground\""]
["59:22,580","59:30,520","\"But then he wasn't crushed 42. Oh, you're right. It's where crushed 40 brought him back to life with their power music holding a ring again\""]
["59:30,520","59:35,000","\"Yes, okay, okay, okay. If there's ever a problem the solution is just give them a ring\""]
["59:35,000","59:37,960","\"Okay\""]
["59:37,960","59:43,000","\"Okay, so the planes all flying to the sides of Maria she screams and Aggie in agony\""]
