["16:44,020","16:45,020","\"There's no way.\"\"\""]
["16:45,020","16:52,020","\"So then it got to the point where, you know, when you need to poo so bad, you start actually just clenching your butt cheeks together to hold it in?\""]

["16:56,020","17:05,020","\"And like every four steps it would be like that, \"\"You knees go weak and you start to kind of go dizzy a little bit, you're sweating, you're sweating.\"\"\""]
["17:05,020","17:09,020","\"So anyways, I was like, \"\"This is not gonna work. There's no way.\"\" I start looking around for bushes.\""]

["17:17,100","17:20,660","\"there's no, I saw a car park where they left their gate open\""]
["17:20,660","17:22,300","\"and I was debating if I'd just like go\""]
["17:22,300","17:24,740","\"into the back of their fucking parking lot,\""]

["17:27,260","17:29,540","\"as I could, no go.\""]
["17:29,540","17:31,940","\"So finally I saw a dumpster by a school.\""]
["17:31,940","17:34,380","\"Luckily school was out of session or it was in session\""]
["17:34,380","17:35,580","\"and they weren't outside.\""]
["17:35,580","17:39,460","\"And I went behind a dumpster.\""]
["17:39,460","17:42,520","\"and I had to like push the dumpster like a foot\""]
["17:42,520","17:44,660","\"so I could actually get behind it.\""]
["17:44,660","17:46,700","\"But as that was happening, I don't know\""]

["17:50,620","17:53,020","\"Like the whole time, it was terrible.\""]
["17:53,020","17:56,060","\"And I didn't, because my pants weren't all the way off,\""]
["17:56,060","17:58,220","\"like I didn't wanna poo on my pants.\""]
["17:58,220","18:00,860","\"So I ended up putting my arm against the wall\""]
["18:00,860","18:03,340","\"and one on the dumpster and my legs like up\""]
["18:03,340","18:06,300","\"and I put my foot up like against like one of the things,\""]
["18:06,300","18:07,740","\"like the little wall area.\""]
["18:07,740","18:13,740","\"And I was like holding myself up like Spider-Man just like fucking diarrhea pouring out of my ass.\""]
["18:13,740","18:17,620","\"It was really bad. I felt really bad.\""]
["18:17,620","18:21,980","\"And all I had, I had a plastic bag and I had some receipts in there.\""]

["18:35,820","18:37,460","\"It's all right. I'm a grown man.\""]
["18:37,460","18:41,220","\"When I was younger my dad thought it would be real funny to prank me\""]
