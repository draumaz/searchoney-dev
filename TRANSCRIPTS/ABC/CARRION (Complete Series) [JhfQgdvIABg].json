["03:59,560","04:00,840","\"I didn't know that.\""]
["04:00,840","04:05,600","\"So this is that what you are like a carcass?\""]
["04:05,600","04:08,280","\"I mean, you turn things into carcasses.\""]

["05:25,720","05:26,560","\"(laughs)\""]
["05:26,560","05:27,800","\"- I like how you're shaped like a big,\""]
["05:27,800","05:29,520","\"like weird hot dog.\""]

["05:30,960","05:32,840","\"- That's your ultimate form.\""]
["05:32,840","05:33,880","\"The hot dog?\""]
["05:33,880","05:37,440","\"Oh, I guess it's probably supposed to look like a centipede or something.\""]
["05:37,440","05:39,880","\"Ooh, you can rip those off.\""]
["05:39,880","05:41,360","\"Oh, I can't go back out that way.\""]

["05:43,760","05:47,760","\"Ooh, spinning.\""]
["05:47,760","05:49,440","\"My favorite.\""]
["05:49,440","05:51,040","\"What's down here?\""]
["05:51,040","05:52,200","\"Can I get down there?\""]
["05:52,200","05:54,000","\"Be careful if you try to go down there.\""]
["05:54,000","05:55,920","\"What if that thing slices you up?\""]
["05:55,920","05:57,200","\"I don't think I can go down there.\""]
["05:57,200","06:01,160","\"This is easily the most relatable character in video games.\""]
["06:02,360","06:04,360","\"I do think about doing this stuff quite a bit.\""]
["06:04,360","06:07,960","\"There you go, there's another lever to pull.\""]
["06:07,960","06:10,960","\"You know me tell me, I love weavos.\""]
["06:10,960","06:13,000","\"Come on, fucking.\""]
["06:13,000","06:14,440","\"You know, there we go.\""]
["06:14,440","06:15,440","\"Grabbing stuff can be kind of tricky.\""]
["06:15,440","06:17,200","\"I wonder if this is more of a mouse game.\""]
["06:17,200","06:18,800","\"I was just about to say that.\""]
["06:18,800","06:19,800","\"It could be.\""]
["06:19,800","06:24,360","\"Except I was about to say it and then I was going to say something really cool after\""]
["06:24,360","06:26,440","\"it but then now I don't want to say it anymore.\""]
["06:26,440","06:27,440","\"What were you going to do?\""]
["06:27,440","06:31,120","\"No, I was going to say something and do something really cool but that would have been predicated\""]
["06:31,120","06:32,720","\"on me being the first person to say that.\""]
["06:32,720","06:33,920","\"So now I'm not gonna say it.\""]
["06:33,920","06:34,820","\"- Flock, okay, I'm sorry.\""]
["06:34,820","06:35,760","\"I didn't mean to ruin your day.\""]
["06:35,760","06:37,240","\"- No, you didn't ruin anything.\""]
["06:37,240","06:38,640","\"In fact, I'm glad you said it first\""]
["06:38,640","06:41,800","\"'cause it took the pressure off of me, you know.\""]
["06:41,800","06:42,760","\"- Thanks, Law.\""]
["06:42,760","06:44,160","\"- Yeah, you're welcome.\""]
["06:44,160","06:45,560","\"See how I did that?\""]
["06:45,560","06:46,400","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:46,400","06:47,240","\"- Oh, I see.\""]
["06:47,240","06:48,080","\"- Caution, unprotected.\""]
["06:48,080","06:49,320","\"Yeah, just bleed through.\""]
["06:49,320","06:50,160","\"- Can I do that?\""]
["06:50,160","06:53,400","\"- You can grab through it and grab that lever.\""]
["06:53,400","06:55,240","\"- Oh yeah, you can grab down at the lever,\""]
["06:55,240","06:56,080","\"can't you?\""]
["06:56,080","06:56,920","\"- No, I can't go that far.\""]
["06:56,920","07:00,080","\"- No, I think you can get your hand through.\""]
["07:00,080","07:00,920","\"- Yeah, there you go.\""]
["07:00,920","07:01,760","\"What the fuck?\""]
["07:01,760","07:04,040","\"Can I?\""]
["07:04,040","07:06,920","\"You shot your hand through that and it went pretty far.\""]
["07:06,920","07:08,440","\"I think you could probably hit that lever\""]
["07:08,440","07:10,400","\"if you really, really gave it your dang-dest.\""]
["07:10,400","07:12,040","\"I don't think that's gonna happen.\""]
["07:12,040","07:13,800","\"You just touched the floor.\""]
["07:13,800","07:15,440","\"That's it's a grabby tentacles.\""]
["07:15,440","07:17,240","\"Oh, okay, that's not the--\""]
["07:17,240","07:18,840","\"Oh yeah, those are the moving tentacles.\""]
["07:18,840","07:20,920","\"Those aren't the grabby tentacles I see.\""]
["07:20,920","07:21,760","\"All right, never mind.\""]
["07:21,760","07:24,320","\"You probably can extend your range later or something.\""]
["07:24,320","07:26,920","\"Wait, can you rip that off to the left though?\""]
["07:26,920","07:27,920","\"Yeah, okay.\""]
["07:30,880","07:31,920","\"I am to be great.\""]
["07:31,920","07:37,480","\"I wonder what you're going to fight.\""]
["07:37,480","07:39,000","\"I know right.\""]
["07:39,000","07:40,000","\"You go in that little hole.\""]
["07:40,000","07:43,600","\"Oh, it's another save.\""]
["07:43,600","07:44,880","\"I guess.\""]
["07:44,880","07:46,680","\"Can you travel between the two?\""]
["07:46,680","07:47,760","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["07:47,760","07:49,760","\"It probably gave you a fast travel point.\""]
["07:49,760","07:52,080","\"Whoa.\""]
["07:52,080","07:54,760","\"Oh, this is getting so weird.\""]
["07:54,760","07:57,240","\"I say just go with it.\""]
["07:57,240","07:59,840","\"What a great fucking idea for a game.\""]
["07:59,840","08:02,840","\"It's definitely interesting.\""]
["08:02,840","08:06,840","\"It's kind of like, you know, remember that game inside?\""]
["08:06,840","08:07,840","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["08:07,840","08:11,840","\"When you want to be like that, that being that thing was like the coolest part.\""]
["08:11,840","08:13,840","\"They're like, let's just make a game out of that.\""]
["08:13,840","08:14,840","\"It'd be.\""]
["08:14,840","08:18,840","\"This thing does move like fucking nothing else.\""]
["08:18,840","08:20,840","\"Like, whoa.\""]
["08:20,840","08:24,840","\"Does it feel like anything to control this thing?\""]
["08:24,840","08:28,840","\"Like, is there another game that you can think of that, like, the movement?\""]
["08:28,840","08:30,840","\"the movement and\""]
["08:30,840","08:33,000","\"Actions feel similar to\""]
["08:33,000","08:36,480","\"Not really I mean it's\""]
["08:36,480","08:42,840","\"It looks intuitive all you do is you move the analog stick and he goes all over the place you don't really have to do anything\""]
["08:42,840","08:44,920","\"okay\""]
["08:44,920","08:51,120","\"It's got a bit of a physical feel to it careful with this guy. He's got an actual gun. Oh my god a gun oh\""]
["08:51,120","08:53,960","\"fuck\""]
["08:53,960","08:56,880","\"Yeah\""]
["08:57,840","08:59,180","\"Give me that\""]
["08:59,180","09:03,740","\"Do you ever feel like sometimes with video games that they are constrained?\""]
["09:03,740","09:07,220","\"sometimes by like reality or by like what we\""]

["09:15,280","09:17,880","\"No, no, I know it exactly what you mean right now\""]
["09:17,880","09:22,160","\"You're controlling a thing that like doesn't resemble a person at all\""]
["09:22,160","09:27,820","\"Yeah, and it looks like the mechanics of this game are totally different from any game\""]
["09:27,820","09:29,820","\"where you would be controlling a person.\""]
["09:29,820","09:32,020","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["09:32,020","09:33,020","\"- No, yeah, I got it.\""]
["09:33,020","09:34,620","\"- Like in a first person shooter game,\""]
["09:34,620","09:36,380","\"I feel like a first person shooter game\""]
["09:36,380","09:37,900","\"is always gonna have to balance\""]
["09:37,900","09:40,460","\"some shitty fucking sniper rifle weapon\""]
["09:40,460","09:43,100","\"because those things exist in real life.\""]
["09:43,100","09:47,020","\"But like, why would you design a game with that in it?\""]
["09:47,020","09:47,660","\"You know?\""]
["09:47,660","09:49,740","\"- Yeah, if you just make something completely unique,\""]
["09:49,740","09:50,540","\"you don't have to do that.\""]
["09:50,540","09:52,020","\"- Are you able to go down that too,\""]

["09:56,620","10:00,640","\"This fucking thing. Oh, you can't hit me. Oh\""]
["10:00,640","10:05,540","\"Fuck I feel like I'm overpowered like I mean\""]
["10:05,540","10:11,460","\"I think the game wants to start you off that way and they're probably gonna make the enemies tougher and tougher as you go\""]
["10:11,460","10:17,300","\"And I want to eat every little bit, but also it's really hard to aim with an analog stick like this whoa\""]
["10:17,300","10:24,460","\"Give me that let me eat you there we go. I'm gonna try this mouse one sec\""]

["10:29,940","10:33,940","\"Does it feel better with a mouse? Kind of.\""]

["10:38,980","10:42,900","\"The probably is power ups that increase your reach. Yeah, it's probably just going to be...\""]
["10:42,900","10:46,660","\"Both times I've seen that there's been a switch on the other side of them,\""]
["10:46,660","10:51,220","\"so I assume that you just need a longer reach. Let's go down here and rip that off.\""]
["10:51,220","10:54,580","\"Ripping things off doesn't feel as good with the mouse because it's slower.\""]
["10:54,580","11:00,860","\"Okay, but doing that's definitely way easier. Oh\""]
["11:00,860","11:07,860","\"You fucking asshole see the way my little parts slither to away. Yeah, that was cool\""]
["11:07,860","11:11,780","\"That oh\""]

["11:19,980","11:21,980","\"Mm-hmm. Oh\""]
["11:21,980","11:26,900","\"Spread your bayou man speed by faking by you dude blob monsters\""]
["11:26,900","11:33,060","\"I think are always like the fucking sickest shit. Have you seen the blob the blob like the movie?\""]
["11:33,060","11:36,180","\"I've seen one of them. I know that they've actually never seen the blob\""]
["11:36,180","11:40,280","\"I've just seen some scenes that you showed me the one from the 80s is really cool\""]
["11:40,280","11:42,820","\"I'm pretty sure that's the one that I've seen\""]
["11:42,820","11:45,460","\"It's like actually scary\""]
["11:45,900","11:50,200","\"Yeah, it's I don't know there's there is something that's like really fucking\""]
["11:50,200","11:57,580","\"Unnerving about like a giant amoeba or something like that. Yeah, it doesn't discriminate against who fucking kills\""]
["11:57,580","12:04,200","\"Also, can you do anything with that that resembles the container you were born out of wait\""]
["12:04,200","12:10,940","\"Where was it just like that? Oh, yeah, is that oh, that's it. That's a power up. I think yeah break it. Oh shit\""]

["12:23,700","12:25,460","\"Can't believe I fucking missed that. Yeah.\""]
["12:25,460","12:30,660","\"There we go. Cool. Wow.\""]
["12:30,660","12:37,300","\"I guess that's what power ups are gonna look like in this game.\""]
["12:37,300","12:42,020","\"Do you ever see that fucking Ryan Reynolds movie where there's a blob in space and\""]

["12:52,340","12:54,500","\"\"\"It's a buff blob.\"\"\""]

["12:57,440","13:00,040","\"-Oh, yeah, 'cause it's little, but it's like super strong\""]
["13:00,040","13:02,240","\"and then it keeps growing as it,\""]
["13:02,240","13:05,480","\"like, kills and absorbs crew members.\""]

["13:53,200","14:01,880","\"Maybe I shouldn't be eating them until I need them. Yeah, that's they got a lot of nice like convincing screams in this game\""]
["14:01,880","14:04,760","\"Yeah, that sounds truly horrified I\""]
["14:04,760","14:09,120","\"Feel like uh have you noticed that like\""]
["14:09,880","14:13,660","\"Rampage games have kind of disappeared a little bit. Oh, yeah\""]
["14:13,660","14:18,920","\"Like there used to be like a lot of open-world games where you could just like kill NPCs\""]
["14:18,920","14:23,520","\"Even if that wasn't the purpose of the game like hulko ultimate rampage\""]
["14:23,520","14:30,720","\"I think a lot of that is thanks to like fucking people getting pissed off about it and saying it like influences kids to kill shit\""]
["14:30,720","14:38,200","\"When they have the option to just kill shit, I guess but like I don't know like all we've got now is like rockstar stuff\""]
["14:38,480","14:43,120","\"Yeah, I'm not even saying like GTA clones specifically\""]
["14:43,120","14:48,000","\"I'm just saying there were a lot of games where like like Assassin's Creed is not necessarily about\""]
["14:48,000","14:53,640","\"murdering people on the street, but the first few assassins creed you you could just fucking kill people\""]
["14:53,640","14:57,600","\"That was just something you could fuck around with and now it's like\""]
["14:57,600","15:06,520","\"The last one I played was the pirate one and you you fucking you straight up cannot murder people as a pirate\""]
["15:07,120","15:14,700","\"Wait, what does that say about echo locator nearby nearby hive crevices? Oh, that's what that is. Yes, as if you hit left shift. Oh\""]

["15:17,700","15:20,980","\"Like that this thing\""]
["15:20,980","15:30,540","\"Probably unlocked that door finally my point is now I feel like killing games like they're games like this or\""]
["15:30,540","15:34,620","\"Or like man eaters one that I played recently where you're just a shark\""]
["15:35,020","15:40,900","\"Is that fun by the way? I was thinking about getting it during their summer sale if you see it for really cheap\""]
["15:40,900","15:46,180","\"It's it's like if you pay like maybe like 10 or 15 bucks or something for it's probably worth it\""]
["15:46,180","15:52,100","\"Okay, it's one of those games where you're definitely bored of it by the time it's over, but it was fun\""]
["15:52,100","15:58,700","\"It seems like a game like that can only have so much depth of play. Yeah, but it was it was fun\""]
["15:58,700","16:03,740","\"Here Lyle, would you like to try this with the controller of the mouse? Sure. I'll give it a shot with the controller\""]
