["16:04,060","16:07,060","\"I remember the first time I saw School of Rock I got so happy too\""]
["16:07,060","16:15,000","\"Yeah, the way you do it is that you just go to the rhythm of it and you improvise. That's cool. That's fun\""]
["16:15,000","16:21,940","\"It's probably the most fun part in this whole game. There was a really good way of doing it. They took away your guitar\""]
["16:21,940","16:28,780","\"Are there more of levels? Yeah, no more fun. That's it. No, I thought the whole game was gonna be like a guitar adventure\""]
["16:28,780","16:32,540","\"No, I wish I'm sorry. No more fun. My memory goes up to honestly\""]
["16:33,140","16:36,480","\"That would have been the perfect intro to a game that would have been so cool\""]
["16:36,480","16:44,180","\"I thought you were gonna like they have a fucking guitar blasting adventure. I'm sorry Chris. Oh no more fun\""]
["16:44,180","16:48,220","\"No, don't can we do you want shitty platforming though?\""]
["16:48,220","16:53,680","\"What the fuck you're going right to left what happened to his body? Oh\""]
["16:53,680","16:56,260","\"My god, you're getting jacked\""]
["16:56,260","17:01,620","\"Can we make a mod of Gintaro man, but have mr. Bones is the main character about just a new guitar room and that'd be nice, too\""]
["17:01,820","17:07,540","\"Like mr. Bones on it though can't be too hard to code guitar a man. No, it's not you have a little pelvis feet\""]
["17:07,540","17:16,540","\"Peck like pelvis by the way this level sucks if that's not clear. This is the least fun part of this game\""]
["17:16,540","17:18,540","\"This really is bony plays\""]
["17:18,540","17:22,060","\"Are you sure this isn't fun? I'm sure by the way, just kill me\""]
["17:22,060","17:26,500","\"Rolling\""]
["17:26,500","17:28,500","\"Wrong Saturn game\""]
["17:28,500","17:30,580","\"Same system though\""]
["17:30,580","17:37,020","\"Wow, really yeah, it's rolling start. Bye. That background's really nice. Oh, this is a good. I know this game. Oh\""]
["17:37,020","17:46,780","\"Bro, he's sonic. Why did this character never catch on he's way cooler than most?\""]
["17:46,780","17:49,580","\"Can we buy Mr. Bones rights?\""]
["17:49,580","17:54,680","\"I don't know who has the rights to it. Oh god that shadow is confusing. Yep\""]
["17:58,060","18:04,480","\"Oh fuck the shadows really confusing what the fuck oh Jesus that there goes your arm. Yep. There it goes\""]
["18:04,480","18:06,420","\"There it is\""]
["18:06,420","18:13,500","\"Why we these do a shitload of damage. Oh, you already lost your YNE. I see you're supposed to always have the shadow underneath right\""]
["18:13,500","18:23,300","\"This wacky universe go right there you go left in this universe bone is law. This is the bone of scone dude\""]
["18:27,300","18:29,300","\"Four score and seven bones\""]
["18:29,300","18:33,100","\"Abraham bone freed the bones\""]
["18:33,100","18:40,700","\"Each from the northern bones from the southern. Did you know that inside your body your skeleton is actually green\""]
["18:40,700","18:43,220","\"Do you know that brushing your teeth your actually massaged the dark?\""]
["18:43,220","18:45,660","\"Yeah, my skeleton glowed in the dark\""]
["18:45,660","18:47,900","\"When it came out\""]
["18:47,900","18:53,420","\"I picked up my finger until it came out. I know this game is running like shit\""]
["18:53,420","19:00,720","\"But the hit box is seemed pretty good at least it's not running like shit. Look at mr. Bones. He's at a beautiful 60 frames per second\""]
["19:00,720","19:07,260","\"Yeah, cuz they had to make a fit. It's two discs. Yeah, and stuff like this\""]
["19:07,260","19:11,320","\"Which is why it's on surprise like the foreground and shit always is in front of you\""]
["19:11,320","19:16,060","\"That was close. This is really nice though like this environment in total. Oh\""]
["19:16,060","19:20,020","\"I don't see a second CD games like this. I'm sorry Saturn my view\""]
["19:20,020","19:24,880","\"I would have loved this game as a kid. I fucking like that. Did you ever play Hugo the troll on PS1?\""]
["19:24,880","19:30,520","\"No, I like that. That was a piece of shit and I like that as a little kid. I play Jersey Devil\""]
["19:30,520","19:34,920","\"That's a little charm though. I like Hugo the troll. Hugo the troll is awful. I\""]
["19:34,920","19:37,720","\"Just in a treat me\""]
["19:37,720","19:42,960","\"Saturn has a lot of games that have character even if maybe they're not so hot\""]
["19:42,960","19:46,480","\"Well, we should play through a bunch of dreamcastes like that too. Yeah, no\""]
["19:46,480","19:51,420","\"I always thought the Dreamcast was like the shitty console. No one liked it had no good games, but no\""]
["19:51,420","19:55,300","\"There's a lot of I see a game on it. It's like unique and it's interesting a lot of fun stuff on there\""]
["19:55,300","19:59,240","\"It's just because unique stuff like that doesn't sell with us. Yeah, yeah\""]
["19:59,240","20:05,420","\"Do you know that when you brush your teeth you're massaging your skeleton\""]
["20:05,420","20:11,160","\"So make your mr. Bone happy you're not massaging your skill. Yeah, your teeth are part of skeleton\""]
["20:11,160","20:14,980","\"I know that but they don't have nerves on the outside your skeletons coming out\""]
["20:14,980","20:19,220","\"This is a good video.\""]
