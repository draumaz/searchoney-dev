["06:51,880","06:58,120","\"I guess is the the president of Sony made it all on his own. Why should you be useful and look it up or some shit?\""]
["06:58,120","07:02,960","\"I don't know. I actually don't want to know. I like the mystery. It is a mystery box. You're right\""]

["07:06,780","07:09,560","\"Gusting at you. He's so charming\""]
["07:09,560","07:12,680","\"Can you feel the gust on your vibrating controller?\""]
["07:12,680","07:16,120","\"It's going wind out of the hole under my cock. Is it really blowing wind out of the hole?\""]
["07:16,120","07:20,760","\"My cock is starting to free shut. Did you feel actual pain there? Yes?\""]
["07:21,160","07:25,580","\"Okay, it sticks the needles out of the controller and stabs you that would be cool\""]
["07:25,580","07:32,920","\"Yeah, if it's circumcised you while you're playing I'm not sure if I've talked about this\""]
["07:32,920","07:36,080","\"But you got circumcised by the ps2. I did\""]
["07:36,080","07:41,640","\"No, I have an irrational fear that like my cockhole is gonna get cauterized shut\""]
["07:41,640","07:45,400","\"Like it specifically. I'm sorry. I just didn't laugh at that\""]
["07:45,400","07:50,760","\"It's sort of the same kind of fear is you know when you're up high and you look down and you have that like gut thing\""]
["07:50,760","07:57,320","\"Like oh, what if I fall off this sort of the same thing like if I'm ever like if I'm ever like naked and like using a pan\""]
["07:57,320","08:01,960","\"Or something like that like cooking on a stove or some shit. I'm always like fuck\""]
["08:01,960","08:06,360","\"What if like what if my cock gets in there and it cauterizes the dick hole?\""]
["08:06,360","08:11,720","\"I think that's a valid concern and a perfectly good justification not to cook while naked\""]
["08:11,720","08:19,560","\"Well, what am I supposed to do think about all the hot liquids that you don't want making contact with your skin when you're like say\""]
["08:19,560","08:26,960","\"Using up like a pan to fry bacon or something right there's a lot of reasons not to cook naked are you a chef?\""]
["08:26,960","08:28,480","\"No\""]
["08:28,480","08:33,300","\"See Gordon Ramsay is a chef and he's never said anything about not cooking naked\""]
["08:33,300","08:41,320","\"He's never said anything in favor of cooking naked either. Yeah, so how do laws work in this land Tomar?\""]

["10:24,380","10:27,180","\"I don't want to play it, but I want to watch everyone get killed horribly in it\""]
["10:27,180","10:32,300","\"You know that's all you really want to do whenever you get a more mortal combat game is just watch all the fatalities\""]
["10:32,300","10:34,980","\"By the time you've watched them all you've gone to the next one\""]
["10:34,980","10:40,920","\"I really wish that I could clone myself and play fighting games with me\""]
["10:40,920","10:45,500","\"So that I would be playing against somebody that's exactly my skill level\""]
["10:45,500","10:49,400","\"Because I feel like that's the only circumstance where fighting games are fun\""]
["10:49,400","10:52,880","\"Yeah, is when you're playing against somebody exactly as good as you\""]
["10:52,880","10:58,540","\"I agree because if you're playing with against somebody like way worse than you then it's not challenging\""]
["10:58,540","10:59,540","\"You're just wailing on it\""]
["10:59,540","11:03,340","\"But if you're playing with somebody way better than you then it's just like I can't fucking do anything\""]

["13:52,500","13:58,100","\"Bring your PlayStation to grandma's ass while she makes you beef stew. I remember I knew I knew\""]
["13:58,100","14:11,580","\"No, you grandma never made you beef stew really stupid duck\""]
["14:11,580","14:18,180","\"This game rocks. I love this game. Yeah, it's actually really cool. I'm sorry. I called it not a game\""]
["14:18,180","14:24,560","\"I hope it's 60 hours long. I just say like the art direction is the only thing that I I would consider\""]
["14:24,560","14:29,400","\"It looks good, but yeah like the aesthetic is like\""]
["14:29,400","14:35,280","\"It's a little like steadily, you know generic or whatever. Yeah, everything's too clean, but I still like it\""]
["14:35,280","14:43,580","\"Like I don't think that there's I don't think that there's pages upon pages of like back road lore written for these guys\""]
["14:43,580","14:47,760","\"This game isn't anyone's baby. I guess is what I'm I'm sure it is\""]
["14:47,760","14:52,600","\"I'm sure it is. It must be some of these baby\""]
["14:52,600","15:01,360","\"All right, my dad perceptions a little shit right here. Oh, there we go. Oh my god. It's getting crazy over here\""]
["15:01,360","15:06,560","\"Look at that. That's beautiful. But Mario Galer. What do you call it? Mario Odyssey had that kind of effect, too?\""]
["15:06,560","15:13,840","\"Yeah, I honestly think more games that take advantage of cartoony styles like this\""]
["15:13,840","15:17,840","\"Just staring at that umbrella right now, watching the little beads hit it.\""]
["15:17,840","15:18,840","\"Looks really nice.\""]
["15:18,840","15:21,040","\"I love this.\""]
["15:21,040","15:24,840","\"I'm actually glad we put this on as a joke.\""]
["15:24,840","15:25,840","\"Wow.\""]
["15:25,840","15:27,840","\"You ever played GTA 4?\""]
["15:27,840","15:28,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:28,840","15:32,280","\"I always thought looking up in that game was kind of weird but cool.\""]
["15:32,280","15:34,440","\"It makes everything go wide angle.\""]
["15:34,440","15:35,440","\"Does it?\""]
["15:35,440","15:36,440","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:36,440","15:40,600","\"I remember when GTA 4 came out, I thought it was like the craziest thing.\""]
["15:40,600","15:41,600","\"I loved it.\""]
["15:41,600","15:42,600","\"It blew my mind.\""]
["15:42,600","15:44,800","\"like flop and overcars the shit.\""]
["15:44,800","15:45,640","\"- Yeah.\""]
["15:45,640","15:47,840","\"- Nothing was, you know what, even GTA 5\""]
["15:47,840","15:50,520","\"didn't feel as good as it, at least not to me.\""]
["15:50,520","15:53,880","\"- I feel like GTA 4 felt more physics-y.\""]
["15:53,880","15:57,360","\"And GTA 5 like worked a little bit better.\""]
["15:57,360","16:02,040","\"- GTA 4 has a lot of things\""]
["16:02,040","16:05,240","\"that just look and feel super awkward.\""]
["16:05,240","16:06,360","\"- Yeah, but it's funny.\""]
["16:06,360","16:10,040","\"- Yeah, I agree with you there.\""]
["16:10,040","16:13,160","\"But I think GTA 5 plays better.\""]
["16:13,160","16:19,400","\"Hey, there was something to the whole like euphoria engine that was really fun about GTA 4.\""]
["16:19,400","16:26,540","\"Like every car felt like it was a fucking like shopping cart on ice, but it was still fun.\""]
["16:26,540","16:30,080","\"GTA 5, for me, it has to be modified to be fun.\""]
["16:30,080","16:30,560","\"I hate it.\""]
["16:30,560","16:32,840","\"It is pretty silly.\""]
["16:32,840","16:33,560","\"There we go.\""]
["16:33,560","16:36,020","\"Wow.\""]
["16:36,020","16:37,520","\"Ah, the multi-tap!\""]
["16:37,520","16:39,640","\"I can't believe it.\""]
["16:39,720","16:40,720","\"Is it getting reigned on?\""]
["16:40,720","16:41,720","\"Yeah, it's getting ruined.\""]
["16:41,720","16:42,720","\"It's getting ruined.\""]
["16:42,720","16:44,640","\"Oh, look at that so amazing.\""]
["16:44,640","16:45,640","\"That's actually really cool.\""]
["16:45,640","16:47,680","\"I don't want to break it though.\""]
["16:47,680","16:48,680","\"It's broken already.\""]
["16:48,680","16:51,080","\"I just want to enjoy the pitter patter of the reigned rocks.\""]
["16:51,080","16:52,080","\"Oh, yeah, it's not wired.\""]
["16:52,080","16:53,080","\"It doesn't work.\""]
["16:53,080","16:54,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["16:54,080","16:57,120","\"You'll also have to find one of the five games that actually supports the multi tab.\""]
["16:57,120","16:58,320","\"There was Crash Bash.\""]
["16:58,320","17:04,200","\"I think Twisted Metal, at least one of the Twisted Metals might have supported it.\""]
["17:04,200","17:07,320","\"Crash Bash was such a piece of shit.\""]
["17:07,320","17:10,020","\"I played the fuck out of it at a friend's house.\""]
["17:10,020","17:12,320","\"Was that their Mario party I'm guessing?\""]
["17:12,320","17:13,320","\"Yeah.\""]

["17:14,320","17:15,320","\"Oh!\""]
["17:15,320","17:16,520","\"Is poor little fucking guy?\""]
["17:16,520","17:18,220","\"He didn't have to die.\""]
["17:18,220","17:20,220","\"I'm just trying to get that one thing and keep missing.\""]
["17:20,220","17:22,220","\"He didn't have to feel horrible pain.\""]
["17:22,220","17:23,420","\"Can I even get back?\""]
["17:23,420","17:25,720","\"That's a new feature of the PlayStation 5\""]
["17:25,720","17:27,920","\"is that the characters feel the pain.\""]
["17:27,920","17:30,920","\"I don't want them to feel pain.\""]
["17:30,920","17:31,920","\"Oh.\""]

["17:50,420","17:51,820","\"Yeah, but they were cool.\""]
["17:51,820","17:54,020","\"I don't know what an SOB is.\""]
