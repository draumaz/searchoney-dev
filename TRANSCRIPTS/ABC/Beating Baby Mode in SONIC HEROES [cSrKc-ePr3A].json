["09:23,380","09:27,640","\"It's two shows mixed together. It's like yeah, so we're pitching help editors. They were like don't pitch it as a new idea\""]
["09:27,640","09:32,560","\"They were like call it. I'm exactly what it was. They said call it double double, but palatable normal\""]
["09:32,560","09:35,200","\"Yeah, that is the way that's nothing like that\""]
["09:35,200","09:40,680","\"That is that's the problem with reviews now because everything is like compared to something else like anytime a game comes out\""]
["09:40,680","09:46,200","\"It's either compared to like Dark Souls or Breath of the Wild so worst advice. I've ever been given it slide by life\""]
["09:46,200","09:49,040","\"Nobody wants to hear that because they just think you're a fucking idiot\""]
["09:49,040","09:53,760","\"It took me years to break out of that because you're like, well, you're like older than me and your more experienced.\""]

["10:07,560","10:08,560","\"You wouldn't get them invested.\""]
["10:08,560","10:12,360","\"They're not going to look at your business card to confirm if you were like worth listening to or not.\""]
["10:12,360","10:16,840","\"My only advice is that if you're ever in a pitch, pitch your pitch.\""]
["10:16,840","10:17,840","\"You want to make.\""]
["10:17,840","10:19,340","\"You want stutters, which is fun.\""]

["10:36,020","10:37,860","\"and stand up with a direction and look.\""]
["10:37,860","10:40,180","\"- You want to conceal Carrie and leopard into the pitch.\""]
["10:40,180","10:41,260","\"- You want to open up your trudge coat\""]
["10:41,260","10:43,100","\"and show a dynamite strap to your heel\""]
["10:43,100","10:45,820","\"and pull a boy little device and say,\""]

["10:56,260","10:59,100","\"with Gen Z humor and then putting a Glock on the fucking table.\""]
["10:59,100","11:00,820","\"- Yeah, yeah, yeah.\""]

["11:36,520","11:46,680","\"I have to say something. This is actually something I never noticed coming to California, but everyone here, it's like you kind of have to realize that everyone else is out for themselves.\""]
["11:46,680","11:49,680","\"And it's like when you know we're talking about opening the door, right?\""]
["11:49,680","11:50,680","\"Yeah, I hope so.\""]
["11:50,680","12:00,080","\"In Philly, I open the door for people and they usually say thank you and I'm like no problem, or I'll actively wait for people to come to the door so they can come inside and I'll open the door for them.\""]
["12:00,080","12:02,080","\"And then when someone's leaving, I'll open the door for them.\""]
["12:02,080","12:06,240","\"And now, being in California, I've never heard like, \"\"Thank you.\"\"\""]
["12:06,240","12:10,000","\"And like, people have like, forcibly pushed in front of me to get inside buildings.\""]
["12:10,000","12:16,320","\"And just seeing drivers too, like, driving with Chris is like, so hectic and scary.\""]
["12:16,320","12:19,360","\"- He's called for his big state, but LA specifically is like,\""]
["12:19,360","12:22,640","\"is like a flame to like the sociopath moms. - Yeah, it's scary.\""]
["12:22,640","12:26,240","\"- Like, they can be like this. Every state would definitely have, like,\""]
["12:26,240","12:29,120","\"just maniacs of people that are, you know, giant narcissists.\""]
["12:29,120","12:32,280","\"But then, but all those people leave normal states.\""]
["12:32,280","12:34,280","\"Yeah, because they hear about California.\""]
["12:34,280","12:35,280","\"And they come here and hear about California.\""]
["12:35,280","12:37,280","\"So per capita, there's got to be way more like people\""]
