["06:44,780","06:46,220","\"You're in the secret group now, Chris.\""]
["06:46,220","06:48,220","\"They have like small red faces.\""]

["06:52,220","06:53,220","\"They're in the catacombs.\""]
["06:53,220","06:55,660","\"They're gonna be like skeletons and zombies trying to gnaw off your head.\""]
["06:55,660","06:58,660","\"Have you seen the video on YouTube of the guy holding the mic up the Miyamoto sipping\""]
["06:58,660","06:59,660","\"suit?\""]
["06:59,660","07:00,660","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["07:00,660","07:06,920","\"That's how they got the sound yeah, that fucking the world the guy who's like supposed to be like the chill style like\""]
["07:06,920","07:10,620","\"Nobody knows what the puppets are making me watch out Chris\""]
["07:10,620","07:16,580","\"Kills you so you got a couple hops if you do you get a spin it ash you get more\""]
["07:16,580","07:25,240","\"Satisfying oh this is cool\""]
["07:25,240","07:27,240","\"Yeah, you want to oh\""]
["07:27,240","07:33,120","\"What shoot it shoot it yeah, bubble\""]
["07:33,120","07:43,780","\"No, just like in real life the seven foot spider you could fucking kill it with a single bubble\""]
["07:43,780","07:50,600","\"Oh, man, it's the night of the second day you want to pop those no shit really. Yeah. Thanks. Go. You know why?\""]
["07:50,600","07:56,780","\"I don't know if you know this Chris. Yeah, because that's the only way out. Okay, that's fair\""]
["07:56,780","08:00,240","\"Chris, you know this story by the time this game got made right\""]
["08:00,240","08:05,360","\"Me a motor was warning. They were working on like the kind of time expansion\""]
["08:05,360","08:08,980","\"But then our new mo wanted to do something new so me a motor said he could do something new\""]
["08:08,980","08:15,280","\"But only if he could make it in a year. Oh, yeah, so that's why this game recycles assets in like a weird way\""]
["08:15,280","08:19,480","\"It's kind of like it's a new dimension, but like it's really creative with its concepts\""]
["08:19,480","08:24,640","\"Yeah, I recognize this music. I love this song. It's a really really good song\""]
["08:24,640","08:31,120","\"Yeah, I saw that one guy in Narrow's video about how they pretty much rushed out the game in a year\""]
["08:31,120","08:35,480","\"But because they rushed it out, that's why it's good. Yeah, and they were really creative with it\""]
["08:35,480","08:40,240","\"And then when he went back to fix all of the little problems he made it way worse. Oh the 3DS one's so horrible\""]
["08:40,240","08:45,840","\"I pity anybody's played that anyone honestly. I think we discussed this only fuck that scary\""]
["08:47,360","08:54,360","\"Strange looking child. Are you a new friend of the bombers gang? Your manners seem much better than those nasty little baby\""]
["08:54,360","09:04,360","\"Destructive bubbles and destroy them\""]
["09:04,360","09:10,960","\"Yeah, I'll do it. Go kill them. Go. I'm gazing. Let's see. Let's see what this is all about\""]
["09:14,320","09:18,100","\"You can see you're outside the town right now in the wait go back to that Chris\""]
["09:18,100","09:22,600","\"Looks like a face does. Oh, there's a guy there look at him\""]
["09:22,600","09:28,200","\"Wait look at his hair\""]
["09:28,200","09:33,040","\"His model his hair model is stuck to his ears, but his head is going to his hair. What the hell?\""]
["09:33,040","09:38,840","\"He's pretty balding perpetually. I don't think this game was meant to be viewed in HD. It's giving me PTSD\""]
["09:38,840","09:41,360","\"Okay, look at the moon. Oh\""]
["09:42,880","09:45,720","\"God isn't it pretty no pretty cute\""]
["09:45,720","09:48,360","\"That's fucking scary\""]
["09:48,360","09:53,400","\"That's so cool. I saw the 3ds moon. They had it look pretty bad. Oh\""]
["09:53,400","09:57,360","\"I see there you go. Oh shit. Oh\""]
["09:57,360","09:59,920","\"My god\""]
["09:59,920","10:03,000","\"Yeah, and then the world ends fucking that's so cool\""]
["10:03,000","10:07,500","\"Yeah, that is a very versatile tell us\""]
["10:08,400","10:13,640","\"It was wiping his ass. It's so cool. He's a bastard. You're spanking pretty. You know you're watching him\""]
["10:13,640","10:15,640","\"So there's a thingy down here now\""]
["10:15,640","10:20,000","\"Yeah, you can leave now you got it. What the fuck is that?\""]
["10:20,000","10:23,020","\"Okay\""]
["10:23,020","10:28,160","\"The scary moon is crying. Well did you find that troublemaker? What was that loud noise?\""]
["10:28,160","10:31,160","\"A moon's tear has fallen\""]
["10:31,160","10:36,520","\"Just like in real life when the moon is sad it cries fucking flaming tears the destroy office buildings\""]
["10:37,000","10:43,140","\"It's weird. I was reading that like I guess when they were into making the game they went to like their friends wedding in like Korea\""]
["10:43,140","10:46,220","\"They're having a hard time with Japan. So like\""]
["10:46,220","10:49,300","\"They dropped the food here on near the wedding\""]
["10:49,300","10:54,100","\"So that's what like the idea came from there like they were celebrating happiness and like new life in a time\""]
["10:54,100","10:59,540","\"We're like they could have been blown into fucking smithereens. So I want to make a really depressing game. That's so cool\""]
["10:59,540","11:06,340","\"Wow, that's kind of personal though for a moment. I know you don't even think about that in the game\""]
["11:06,340","11:08,340","\"You're just like why the fuck do I need a tear?\""]
["11:08,340","11:13,220","\"That's what I was like that's so cool. I can't hear\""]
["11:13,220","11:19,620","\"So I talked to him. Let's see. Oh what you just making a tear collection was your tear reservoir\""]
["11:19,620","11:26,100","\"Okay, thank you dad's fucking scary\""]
["11:26,100","11:30,980","\"Don't dance with him\""]
["11:30,980","11:34,100","\"He wants to pass time. Yeah, oh wait\""]
["11:34,100","11:37,020","\"There's another way you can pass time, but it's way more captivating.\""]
["11:37,020","11:38,460","\"By fucking someone?\""]
["11:38,460","11:39,460","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:39,460","11:40,460","\"Yes.\""]
["11:40,460","11:41,460","\"Not necessarily.\""]
["11:41,460","11:44,820","\"I don't like him.\""]
["11:44,820","11:47,340","\"Yeah, he's got quite the uncomfortable hand.\""]
["11:47,340","11:51,140","\"You can slow the flow of time.\""]
["11:51,140","11:53,660","\"You can move half a day forward.\""]
["11:53,660","11:54,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:54,660","11:55,660","\"Wow.\""]
["11:55,660","11:59,220","\"But I need to get my ocarina, right?\""]
["11:59,220","12:00,220","\"Yeah.\""]
["12:00,220","12:01,220","\"It won't be an ocarina, man.\""]
["12:01,220","12:03,220","\"This is all kind of pointless, but it's kind of a hint for the future.\""]
["12:03,220","12:09,180","\"So I guess it is an entirely pointless. That's cool. Yeah, it's really cool and that was something as a kid\""]
["12:09,180","12:13,540","\"I didn't really understand and I was like stupid, but then when you do it you realize that you do have a lot of time\""]
["12:13,540","12:19,420","\"Yeah, no went once like every says that it's like nobody almost nobody who places knows that like yeah\""]
["12:19,420","12:25,060","\"Because with those two tricks you can do almost anything and it's very comfortable. I think yeah, it never feels unmanageable\""]
["12:25,060","12:28,900","\"So basically I think this is a good time for Dave to tell his story\""]
["12:29,540","12:33,160","\"It sucks, but a while ago me and Jeff started going to the gym\""]
["12:33,160","12:37,780","\"So I just like loaded up on like infinite protein bars and like peanuts and all sorts of stuff\""]
["12:37,780","12:41,820","\"And ain't no vegetables and drank very little water and got massively\""]
["12:41,820","12:46,380","\"Concentrated feel like all sorts of stuff. You had like a four-year-old sense of fucking losing weight\""]
["12:46,380","12:50,980","\"You were like I'm gonna gain muscles by eating protein. I was working\""]
["12:50,980","12:54,780","\"I gained a lot of weight it was awesome, but then not being able to shit is not awesome\""]
["12:54,780","12:56,780","\"What the hell they fucking ruined the story?\""]
["12:57,220","13:02,580","\"Well, how's it ruin you skip the head there's so much to this story. I just remember seeing you\""]
["13:02,580","13:09,180","\"You were making like peanut butter protein smoothies that smelled like crazy peanut butter\""]
["13:09,180","13:14,580","\"I mean, I was doing a lot of shit. I was doing a lot of shit to have this all happen and like then it backfired\""]
["13:14,580","13:16,580","\"Yeah, then it didn't work and so\""]
["13:16,580","13:21,300","\"That sucks. That's how I felt the dawn of the final day. I'm gonna fucking explode\""]
["13:21,740","13:28,740","\"So essentially Dave had like a turd that had scratched the inside of his colon that inflamed it\""]
["13:28,740","13:29,560","\"Oh my god\""]
["13:29,560","13:31,560","\"Because he had eaten too much peanuts\""]
["13:31,560","13:37,140","\"Because you can't process peanuts like other things are kind of like corn and I don't think Dave realized\""]
["13:37,140","13:40,300","\"That and again Dave didn't eat a lot of like\""]
["13:40,300","13:46,920","\"Vegetables and stuff so we stopped on peanuts and meat and before that we went to fucking Fogo de Chao\""]
["13:46,920","13:54,280","\"Which is an expensive steakhouse where we stuffed ourselves with steak so Dave had a pound of meat along with a pound of peanuts\""]
