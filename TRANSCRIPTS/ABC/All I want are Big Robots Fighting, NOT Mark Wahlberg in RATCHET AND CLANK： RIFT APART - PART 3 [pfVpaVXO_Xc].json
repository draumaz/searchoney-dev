["02:14,080","02:16,580","\"Yeah, it's like silence Don Atello\""]
["02:17,160","02:22,060","\"It is weird because he's not he's not radical no he's old and wise yeah\""]
["02:22,060","02:26,900","\"He probably would actually not like to be that I really pisses me off you're right yeah\""]
["02:26,900","02:33,680","\"Next time you want about that for like 20 years you think about all the machines Donatello does yeah\""]
["02:33,680","02:39,020","\"He does too many machines you made ice cube maker. He made eyes at my girl\""]
["02:39,020","02:46,260","\"I'm fucking tired of it. Which turtle uses the stick. That's dawn. Don't tell me is the biggest shithead\""]

["02:52,340","02:58,860","\"Okay, that makes sense. I'll give you that I always liked a Raphael cuz he was cool, but rude\""]
["02:58,860","03:03,560","\"Michael Angel is a good second choice. I like the cool part\""]
["03:03,560","03:12,340","\"No one can be an article yeah, oh he's the big loser he is kind of but he's the one with the Katana\""]
["03:12,340","03:14,900","\"Yeah, he's like the strongest one. That's like\""]
["03:14,900","03:22,540","\"Surprise surprise the least interesting his personality is that he's the leader. Yeah, that's it. I remember okay\""]
["03:22,540","03:26,920","\"So I've never actually been very invested in a gym unit turtles even as a kid\""]
["03:26,920","03:29,600","\"I was like this is really bad like the the show\""]
["03:29,600","03:32,260","\"but\""]
["03:32,260","03:38,820","\"You know the way the Michael Bay movies are really bad. Yeah, there's like one really good scene in each movie like in the first movie\""]
["03:38,820","03:44,180","\"It's when they're like sliding down a snowy mountain and it's like this amazing action set piece. It's just actually good and\""]
["03:44,180","03:48,660","\"Then I remember I saw the trailer for the second movie and it looks so fun\""]
["03:48,660","03:53,160","\"And then all of the fun parts were just using the trailer and there was all this boring filler in between\""]
["03:53,160","03:59,540","\"That sucks, and that's what I hate about his movies. I'm gonna I'm gonna since we're starting off with making enemies\""]
["03:59,540","04:02,720","\"I'm gonna go out on a on another like enemy making binge\""]
["04:02,720","04:08,760","\"I think that like as far as like the franchises you should give someone like Michael Bay\""]
["04:08,760","04:14,640","\"Mmm big talking turtles with swords and fucking cars that turn into robots\""]
["04:14,640","04:19,880","\"Yeah, I probably like the best you could go with it. It's just sad because\""]
["04:19,880","04:22,920","\"He like those movies suck\""]
["04:22,920","04:28,280","\"But all he needs to do to make them enjoyable is have them big fun action movies from start to finish\""]
["04:28,280","04:33,000","\"But it's there's always this like boring filler with humans that nobody care about yeah, that's true\""]
["04:33,000","04:38,340","\"Just fucking leave the fucking humans out nobody cares. What's that fucking asshole? That's a little buff\""]
["04:38,340","04:44,260","\"No, you know what actually like show above in movies. What's that asshole? He keeps using mark wallberg\""]
["04:44,260","04:49,660","\"Fucking wants to see mark wallberg. I don't think that's true that nobody wants to see\""]
["04:49,660","05:02,520","\"The fucking book good looking get him off the screen and put the big robot on have you seen a pain in game?\""]
["05:02,520","05:06,960","\"No, I think that's actually Michael Bay's best movie really yeah, but well breaks in it\""]
["05:06,960","05:10,040","\"So I don't know if that's a transformer's one is fine as it is\""]
["05:10,040","05:14,880","\"It's not great, but it's fine and it's entertaining because there's a ton of robots that walk around and talk in it\""]
["05:14,880","05:21,440","\"It's it's all I need yeah, but then all the other Transformers movies just it's just people standing around talking\""]
["05:21,440","05:22,640","\"It's like I don't fucking care\""]
["05:22,640","05:28,560","\"Yeah, just have robots knock the heads off each other Jeff Goldblum comes in and like chews gum or something\""]
["05:28,560","05:30,560","\"I don't know\""]
["05:31,040","05:34,040","\"I just wish they leave these fucking boring human characters out\""]
["05:34,040","05:36,100","\"Just make a cartoon\""]
["05:36,100","05:40,880","\"Tomer showed me the old Transformers movie from the 80s and it it is fucking amazing\""]
["05:40,880","05:43,120","\"You know that's an accident\""]
["05:43,120","05:44,280","\"Especially the first part\""]
["05:44,280","05:46,320","\"But all they needed like they did what they needed\""]
["05:46,320","05:50,280","\"They just had a bunch of robots fighting for like two hours straight. It was fucking perfect\""]
["05:50,280","05:53,240","\"That is what I would want out of a Transformers movie\""]
["05:53,240","05:59,000","\"Obviously you need story to keep shit going, but they have just enough of that. That's fair\""]
["05:59,640","06:02,440","\"Did you cry when octopautomist died yes?\""]
["06:02,440","06:09,360","\"Okay, she said I'm gonna come close up, but he was but he was black-facing at the time\""]
["06:09,360","06:15,060","\"We all had a good laugh when Starscream got turned to literal dust that made me loll your head. That's good\""]
["06:15,060","06:17,400","\"Because his voice is good too\""]
["06:17,400","06:24,000","\"Yeah, I my favorite thing about old transformers is that Megatron turns into a gun\""]
["06:24,160","06:30,160","\"And then he's got this fucking lackey that's always openly talking about how he's gonna betray him\""]
["06:30,160","06:33,380","\"Yeah, and he's just like he'll turn into a gun and be like hold me\""]
["06:33,380","06:38,500","\"Throw you in the garbage. What are you fucking talking about?\""]
