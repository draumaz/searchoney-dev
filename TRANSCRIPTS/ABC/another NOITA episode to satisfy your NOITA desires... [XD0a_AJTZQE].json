["07:46,940","07:49,280","\"Let's see what that does\""]
["07:49,280","07:52,160","\"What the fuck is that confetti it needs a trigger?\""]
["07:52,160","07:56,280","\"Well doesn't seem dangerous. Yeah, what the fuck is this even?\""]

["07:59,600","08:02,840","\"They're like bugs. They were hitting me\""]
["08:02,840","08:07,800","\"It only gave you one damage out of all that though. What is going on even?\""]
["08:08,160","08:10,580","\"Here I want to use this over here. See if it's actually any good\""]
["08:10,580","08:13,640","\"Like I actually hit it throw it at a guy. Oh\""]
["08:13,640","08:20,420","\"I mean, it's not bad. Oh god if they do occasionally hit you. Hmm. Okay. I'm gonna try the mega laser\""]
["08:20,420","08:24,500","\"Yeah, what's a mega laser? That's pretty sick. Okay\""]
["08:24,500","08:28,040","\"It's like a magic laser\""]
["08:28,040","08:32,720","\"A little rune and everything you think I can beat the game with the mega laser\""]
["08:32,720","08:36,680","\"Well, that you can sure try whoa, okay\""]
["08:36,680","08:37,680","\"Okay.\""]

["08:41,080","08:44,880","\"I have no idea what I'll be doing, but it'll be a time.\""]
["08:44,880","08:51,040","\"So while the point of this game is to get to the bottom, get to the bottom of what's\""]
["08:51,040","08:52,040","\"happened here.\""]
["08:52,040","08:53,040","\"Yep, pretty much.\""]
["08:53,040","08:54,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:54,040","08:55,680","\"It's actually a mystery game.\""]
["08:55,680","09:01,600","\"Just it's just disguised as an action physics pixel game.\""]
["09:01,600","09:04,920","\"But you're really trying to discover who killed your father.\""]
["09:04,920","09:12,900","\"I hate these fuckers. I'm already such a dick. It takes place in Japan in 1987 and your father is the master of a\""]
["09:12,900","09:15,640","\"karate dojo and\""]
["09:15,640","09:17,660","\"You're trying to find out\""]
["09:17,660","09:22,800","\"Who murdered him and it's this Chinese guy with a green outfit, but you don't know\""]
["09:22,800","09:28,500","\"You're pretty good at remembering Japanese game storylines I\""]
["09:29,960","09:36,440","\"Did recently go back and replay the Shenmue 1 and 2 collection. That's because you were the true guy\""]
["09:36,440","09:39,000","\"No, it was before the to that game\""]
["09:39,000","09:44,680","\"No, it was no way swear it actually was before I got cast in that game though\""]
["09:44,680","09:50,320","\"It was I really I really was a big Shenmue fan just because I was a hardcore dreamcast boy\""]
["09:50,320","09:55,080","\"It was the first domino flicked over in your chain of becoming the turtle guy. Oh\""]
["09:56,880","10:03,560","\"Shane of becoming the turtle racing man can't believe you were the turtle guy look what I got aren't I off to a good start\""]
["10:03,560","10:10,600","\"That guy didn't think so damn look at all the damage he did where's my little laser?\""]
["10:10,600","10:15,880","\"Okay, I just wanted to grab your head. There's a huge delay on this laser\""]
["10:15,880","10:20,240","\"So sorry and it shoots gold away\""]
["10:20,240","10:25,240","\"It shoots gold it like when I kill an enemy the gold flies away with it. Oh\""]
["10:25,840","10:27,840","\"So just obliterate them oh\""]
["10:27,840","10:30,640","\"My god, it's so slow. Okay here\""]
["10:30,640","10:36,280","\"It seems like the mega laser is just a bunch of parallel skinny lasers\""]
["10:36,280","10:41,360","\"Only you could be given something called a mega laser and still complain about it me. Yes\""]
["10:41,360","10:43,880","\"Are you saying I complain? No\""]
["10:43,880","10:49,520","\"I'm implying it. I don't blame you honestly. I'm a real piece of shit\""]
["10:49,520","10:52,760","\"Look what I got delicious gold\""]
["10:54,320","10:56,320","\"Now fire mega laser in there\""]
["10:56,320","11:02,680","\"So that portal to them it like the in-between level thing do you have to go through that or you just going down?\""]
["11:02,680","11:06,040","\"No the gold technically\""]
["11:06,040","11:12,100","\"I think there are ways to get past it like the like the game is built so that you could pass around it\""]
["11:12,100","11:19,240","\"But it's usually not practical or possible. No, I guess what I'm asking is if you don't come across that or you fucked\""]
["11:19,240","11:23,880","\"Like is always come across it. Okay. They're like scattered every like\""]
["11:23,880","11:26,840","\"like however many feet, like, like,\""]
["11:26,840","11:29,240","\"there's more than one portal at the bottom of the level\""]

["11:30,520","11:31,360","\"- Okay.\""]
["11:31,360","11:33,280","\"- They really fucked me up there.\""]
["11:33,280","11:34,600","\"Whoa.\""]
["11:34,600","11:37,360","\"- Oh, that seems to spawn them out.\""]
["11:37,360","11:38,800","\"- Yeah, try that combo.\""]
["11:38,800","11:40,960","\"- This is the greenest thing that's ever happened to me.\""]
["11:40,960","11:41,960","\"- That worked pretty good.\""]
["11:41,960","11:42,800","\"Okay.\""]
["11:42,800","11:44,560","\"Electricity immunity is pretty good.\""]
["11:44,560","11:46,880","\"- Mm.\""]
["11:46,880","11:48,680","\"- If you get immunity to anything,\""]
["11:48,680","11:51,800","\"you can just like find that and then just ban it.\""]
["11:51,800","11:53,440","\"- It'd be green if you could like spam\""]
["11:53,440","11:55,440","\"some kind of chain lightning spell.\""]
["11:55,440","11:56,600","\"- Oh, fuck.\""]
["11:56,600","11:58,760","\"- Yeah, just get something really fucking dangerous,\""]
["11:58,760","12:01,120","\"like fire that just lights everything ablaze.\""]
["12:01,120","12:03,960","\"- Yeah, it seems like this compensates for like the delay\""]
["12:03,960","12:06,960","\"by giving you like an extra like five lasers.\""]
["12:06,960","12:08,880","\"- Yeah, this kinda rocks.\""]
["12:08,880","12:10,440","\"I didn't think that would work.\""]
["12:10,440","12:13,280","\"You try, see if you can blast through that with the laser.\""]
["12:13,280","12:15,360","\"- That killed a guy that was standing on it.\""]
["12:15,360","12:16,560","\"You're not gonna get the glow.\""]
["12:16,560","12:17,720","\"- Oh my God!\""]
["12:17,720","12:19,560","\"Woo, what the fuck was that even?\""]
["12:19,560","12:21,640","\"- I don't know, but you obliterated it.\""]
["12:21,640","12:23,160","\"Whoa.\""]
["12:23,160","12:24,960","\"That worked out pretty good.\""]
["12:24,960","12:27,120","\"What do you think caused this fire?\""]
["12:27,120","12:28,720","\"What manner of beast?\""]
["12:28,720","12:31,400","\"- Woo! - Dude, this rocks!\""]
["12:31,400","12:32,240","\"What the fuck?\""]
["12:32,240","12:35,600","\"- Oh, this is a great combo.\""]
["12:35,600","12:38,000","\"Fuck you, dude.\""]
["12:38,000","12:41,040","\"- I like how Tomar gave you like this fucking murder laser\""]
["12:41,040","12:43,560","\"and you're like, here's a thing that can easily kill you.\""]
["12:43,560","12:44,400","\"- Yeah.\""]
["12:44,400","12:47,640","\"Tomar, you shouldn't have died, dude.\""]
["12:47,640","12:49,940","\"You should have adapted.\""]
["12:49,940","12:53,080","\"- Adapted to a giant black hole.\""]
["12:53,080","12:56,080","\"If your game of noida was a job interview, you would have failed really bad.\""]
["12:56,080","12:58,480","\"I suppose so.\""]
["12:58,480","13:03,200","\"Glad that I've never had a game of noida as a job interview.\""]
["13:03,200","13:04,200","\"That's the future.\""]
["13:04,200","13:05,200","\"Oh, it doesn't go through water.\""]
["13:05,200","13:06,720","\"It's like one of those, one of those new ways.\""]
["13:06,720","13:10,800","\"There's gotta be some jobs somewhere, like at least some like QA job where literally\""]
["13:10,800","13:14,240","\"your interview is just playing a video game and talking about it.\""]
["13:14,240","13:16,880","\"Yeah, some, some like new agey like tech job.\""]
["13:16,880","13:20,160","\"It's like here we're a little unconventional and they sit you down with noida and they're\""]
["13:20,160","13:21,680","\"like, all right.\""]
["13:21,680","13:23,560","\"- How do you handle problems in this game\""]
["13:23,560","13:27,560","\"will determine how we think you handle problems in real life?\""]
["13:27,560","13:28,400","\"- Oh, okay.\""]
["13:28,400","13:31,400","\"- That's fucking yuggy-o logic right there.\""]
["13:31,400","13:32,240","\"- Yuggy-o?\""]
["13:32,240","13:33,240","\"- Yuggy-o.\""]
["13:33,240","13:34,960","\"- Like how well you do in a card game\""]
["13:34,960","13:35,800","\"is determining how you do it.\""]
["13:35,800","13:37,600","\"- I guarantee you in that world\""]
["13:37,600","13:39,280","\"that that's how jobs are gained.\""]
["13:39,280","13:42,040","\"- Everybody just sits you down for a game of,\""]
["13:42,040","13:44,880","\"of, of, what was it called in universe,\""]
["13:44,880","13:47,240","\"like monsters and magic or whatever?\""]
["13:47,240","13:48,200","\"- I don't even remember.\""]
["13:48,200","13:50,960","\"I, I didn't ever watch yuggy-o.\""]
["13:50,960","13:54,560","\"It sounded like some weird knockoff of Dungeons and Dragons,\""]
["13:54,560","13:58,360","\"even though it was based on magic, the gathering.\""]
["13:58,360","14:01,320","\"- Yo, Yo was a baby's toy, so nobody played it.\""]
["14:01,320","14:02,560","\"- Remember?\""]
["14:02,560","14:05,400","\"- I remember being the kid at school was like,\""]
["14:05,400","14:08,120","\"I actually got the original show and jumps,\""]
["14:08,120","14:09,640","\"and I read the first few Yo's,\""]
["14:09,640","14:12,480","\"and it's not even about card games, and it's about a--\""]
["14:12,480","14:13,840","\"- Really? - Yeah.\""]
["14:13,840","14:14,960","\"- It wasn't about cards?\""]
["14:14,960","14:16,400","\"- No, it was just about a guy\""]
["14:16,400","14:18,840","\"who was really into traditional board games\""]
["14:18,840","14:20,520","\"and puzzles and stuff, and then--\""]
["14:20,520","14:23,080","\"- So he played Monopoly and then took people's souls?\""]
["14:23,080","14:25,160","\"- Yeah, that's how it started off.\""]
["14:25,160","14:27,480","\"It would be like he'd challenge a guy to a game\""]
["14:27,480","14:30,340","\"where you stick the little swords in the barrel\""]
["14:30,340","14:31,800","\"and if you stick it in the wrong hole,\""]
["14:31,800","14:34,000","\"the guy pops up and you lose or whatever.\""]
["14:34,000","14:36,400","\"- Well, like he's gonna pop a pirate with the fucking guy?\""]
["14:36,400","14:38,080","\"- He plays pop a pirate with the guy\""]
["14:38,080","14:40,480","\"literally for his soul.\""]
["14:40,480","14:41,800","\"(laughing)\""]
["14:41,800","14:44,920","\"When he lost against him, he would steal your sanity\""]
["14:44,920","14:48,520","\"and he'd stick the guy in an eternal state\""]
["14:48,520","14:52,260","\"He like thinks he's being stabbed with swords in a barrel or something\""]
["14:52,260","14:54,600","\"Oh, fuck did they always be something fucked up like that?\""]
["14:54,600","14:57,360","\"How did they spin that so yuggy-o was the good guy?\""]
["14:57,360","15:03,400","\"I think his publishers were just like people seem to like your thing. Let's just exploit kids for money now\""]
["15:03,400","15:05,400","\"Oh my god, that's so weird. Okay\""]
["15:05,400","15:11,320","\"There we go, that's very weird. I didn't know fucking yuggy-o went that deep\""]
["15:11,320","15:16,520","\"Yeah, it did make it seem a lot cooler to to 14 year old me\""]
["15:17,520","15:24,120","\"Like freaking love yugio, but I actually never got I actually did every time I played the card game\""]
["15:24,120","15:27,960","\"I enjoyed it, but I never really got into it because I didn't have any friends that played\""]
["15:27,960","15:30,640","\"I don't think anyone actually knew the rules to it. I\""]
["15:30,640","15:36,000","\"Learned to play with my little brother, but he was literally the only one whoever would play with me\""]
["15:36,000","15:39,920","\"I had I had a yugio like PlayStation one game and\""]
["15:39,920","15:47,280","\"The rules of it in that PlayStation one game are are such that it literally could not function with the physical cards\""]
["15:47,280","15:53,040","\"Like you you pick two cards and it fuses them together and creates a different card\""]
["15:53,040","16:00,800","\"So that is a fusion thing in the physical card world you would literally have to own both the card and the fusion to use it\""]
["16:00,800","16:04,040","\"That was like a big mechanic of that game though\""]
["16:04,040","16:08,960","\"I can't imagine how expensive that game would actually be to play it that way\""]
["16:08,960","16:12,960","\"That was like a second or third gen thing where they started adding the fusion monsters\""]
["16:12,960","16:18,860","\"I think I can't I cannot remember I mean I think to even get like normal monsters you had a few shit together\""]
["16:18,860","16:22,960","\"Well, you had to just you had to sacrifice. That's how it worked. It never used like mana\""]
["16:22,960","16:27,960","\"It was just like you could only summon one monster for turn per turn under normal conditions\""]
["16:27,960","16:34,460","\"And then to summon anything that was like five stars or higher you needed to sacrifice a monster\""]
["16:34,460","16:39,920","\"I just remember my brief time because I like the art on the cards and it was around the time where like oh\""]
["16:40,040","16:45,020","\"I don't know if this happened where you guys were if it was purely a California phenomenon\""]
["16:45,020","16:52,480","\"But there was like a mass exodus from Pokemon like very shortly after it came out where I remember everyone thought it was\""]
["16:52,480","16:59,440","\"Just like Pokemon was really cool for like a year or two. No, no, it's not good\""]
["16:59,440","17:02,720","\"And then right after that it was it was cool to hate on Pokemon\""]
["17:02,720","17:06,600","\"Okay, and the thing that happened was all the kids moved over to yugio\""]
["17:07,360","17:14,840","\"And nobody actually knew how to play it and what I did is I just got a bunch of Japanese cards and made up what they did and no\""]
["17:14,840","17:21,960","\"Unfucking knew better to question me. I don't think anyone really knew the rules either. So oh fuck for all I know I wasn't cheating\""]
["17:21,960","17:26,440","\"You're probably doing really good actually. I think so. Yeah. Oh my god\""]
["17:26,440","17:31,520","\"This is pretty much once if you get a direct hit from those lasers, it seems to always kill\""]
["17:31,520","17:35,400","\"It is kind of scary though. You never know if one of these things gonna blow up or not. Oh\""]
["17:35,880","17:37,880","\"Fuck damn it\""]
["17:37,880","17:41,980","\"Okay, oh god. This is a really sick one. Thank you to Omar\""]
["17:41,980","17:43,980","\"So have you ever beaten beaten Oida?\""]
["17:43,980","17:50,820","\"The only time I technically beat it was on stream when it was in streamer mode and people were voting for things that would help her kill me\""]
["17:50,820","17:54,560","\"So they basically just gave you a free ride. Yeah, they gave me a\""]
["17:54,560","17:59,760","\"Immortality perk which was kind of broken honestly near near the end of it\""]
["17:59,760","18:04,020","\"But it only lasts for a few minutes, but it seems like you only needed a few minutes\""]
["18:04,020","18:10,160","\"But to be fair to beat this game you did you did have to get that far still yeah without it\""]
["18:10,160","18:14,720","\"Oh, and this game is ruthlessly cheap against you\""]
["18:14,720","18:20,060","\"It's the game sheets all the time. It doesn't fair things like things will fly in from off-screen and just kill you\""]
["18:20,060","18:24,240","\"Or you get a new wand that you think will do one thing\""]
["18:24,240","18:30,180","\"but because of some bizarreness and the way the like the spells are placed in the order like it just\""]
["18:30,300","18:35,960","\"Explodes your face and the first time you use it so I don't feel too bad cheating at a game that cheats on you all the time\""]
["18:35,960","18:40,460","\"Cheats on you. I noticed I noticed you phrases a little differently\""]
["18:40,460","18:48,500","\"Keep me these gold. Oh my god. What was that? You're fucking flooded with purple dude get out of there. That's slime\""]
["18:48,500","18:53,200","\"Yeah, that's that's an ear infection. I have a perk that lets me move fast through slime right over here\""]
["18:53,200","18:56,620","\"Slime is just for slowing you down\""]
["18:57,260","19:02,220","\"Dude, we're getting pretty far honestly perhaps due to this epic laser\""]
["19:02,220","19:05,740","\"It kind of does seem though a lot of the time in this game\""]
["19:05,740","19:10,660","\"To beat it you have to have stupid perks like that are just or broken ones like\""]
["19:10,660","19:13,260","\"This isn't really that cheap\""]
["19:13,260","19:17,020","\"Like you something will always come along and kill you anyway\""]
["19:17,020","19:21,860","\"Yeah, I'd be very surprised if you beat the game just because you have this laser, but we'll see yeah\""]
["19:21,860","19:26,780","\"Like one time I had a wand that had nukes in it and I had an explosion immunity and a fire immunity\""]
["19:26,780","19:31,100","\"So the nukes didn't affect me and you you obliterate everything like it's all gone\""]
["19:31,100","19:34,020","\"And you still die pretty quickly cuz shit will just fall on you and kill you\""]
["19:34,020","19:36,460","\"crushed by the weight of your own hubris\""]
["19:36,460","19:42,940","\"The game usually for me starts getting more fun around the jungle level just like weaving in and everything is\""]
["19:42,940","19:48,860","\"The jungle level the one after this one. Yes. Cool. I love that level\""]
["19:48,860","19:52,380","\"That's where the spiders start showing up. Yeah\""]
["19:52,860","19:54,860","\"That'd be a... dang it.\""]
["19:54,860","19:58,860","\"It seems that the spiders are the main villain of this game, huh?\""]
["19:58,860","19:59,860","\"You think?\""]
["19:59,860","20:02,860","\"I don't know. Isn't the final boss, like, spider-like?\""]
["20:02,860","20:03,860","\"Oh yeah, you're right.\""]
["20:03,860","20:06,860","\"It seems like there's a lot of pig enemies in games.\""]
["20:06,860","20:08,860","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
