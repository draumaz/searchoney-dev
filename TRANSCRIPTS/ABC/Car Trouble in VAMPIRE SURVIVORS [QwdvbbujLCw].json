["13:17,380","13:20,640","\"That's not good maybe like your lecture cars is not gonna fix that\""]
["13:20,640","13:25,200","\"It's because we fucking hate like upgrading infrastructure\""]
["13:25,200","13:27,900","\"Yeah, every single time like something bad happens\""]
["13:27,900","13:34,740","\"We're like we should fix this and then like the thing bad stops happening for a little bit and we're like it will never happen again\""]
["13:34,740","13:42,140","\"Maybe everyone should just get hybrids when I know when I was touring like gas was like a hundred and forty for like 400\""]
["13:42,140","13:47,060","\"like miles and it was added up fast 400 miles really isn't that much when\""]
["13:47,060","13:49,980","\"you're touring and driving for like fucking nine straight hours that's like\""]
["13:49,980","13:54,540","\"700 dollars just to get to your next venue it's fucking really expensive yeah\""]
["13:54,540","13:59,100","\"so you know take it with grain and salt gas isn't that great but I mean if it\""]
["13:59,100","14:02,660","\"was electric I don't know what it would have been like an electric man it is\""]
["14:02,660","14:10,020","\"everything those exists electric tour vans I want my or why do you want it so\""]
["14:10,020","14:16,020","\"Get a benefit what you actually used a tour van really yeah, we went up an awesome. It wasn't no\""]
["14:16,020","14:21,780","\"Oh, I could say this I was gonna I was and say this but um enterprise you ever heard of enterprise\""]
["14:21,780","14:24,700","\"Yeah, they suck. They're the worst enterprise\""]
["14:24,700","14:32,020","\"If don't ever use enterprise for vans they have all this like bullshit like stuff meant to fuck you over\""]
["14:32,020","14:35,900","\"like they're they're unfair honestly like they\""]
["14:36,540","14:42,860","\"To explain how bad enterprise is they're like not not all enterprises are the same\""]
["14:42,860","14:45,940","\"Some enterprises are different. It just depends on where you go\""]
["14:45,940","14:49,260","\"You know it's a look of the draw and another thing about enterprise is\""]
["14:49,260","14:55,300","\"It's first come first serve if you do if you see a venue like and you can't get it then in there\""]
["14:55,300","15:00,620","\"If someone shows up and gets it you're not getting that van they will not save you a van Wow\""]
["15:00,620","15:03,660","\"So we we wanted a van it was the perfect van\""]
["15:03,660","15:07,220","\"It was slightly bigger than the one we had but because we went there\""]
["15:07,220","15:15,500","\"Apparently like Dylan was gonna buy it, but you have to be like 21 years old and or no you have to have\""]
["15:15,500","15:21,980","\"Sorry your credit has to be like I forget what it was it was like your credit has to be\""]
["15:21,980","15:26,420","\"3000 Dylan and have 3000 as credit. He was just building his credit. I don't think that's not a real number\""]
["15:26,420","15:31,700","\"No, this is true. That's not the right number. No good credit is like 750\""]
["15:31,700","15:34,000","\"No, no for a credit card you needed a\""]
["15:34,000","15:39,200","\"Minute the the the the oh I see I see no no yeah, no good credit is between a thousand right\""]
["15:39,200","15:43,120","\"I don't know like how we just made that fucking like meme sound\""]
["15:43,120","15:50,140","\"But I see yes, so he went there and he didn't have a credit card to do that\""]
["15:50,140","15:51,820","\"So we had to get his mom to go out there\""]
["15:51,820","15:56,680","\"But before that we had another member who did have enough credit\""]
["15:56,680","16:03,640","\"But he wasn't old enough because you apparently it's not 21. I think it's like 25. Yeah, it's 25\""]
["16:03,640","16:07,320","\"You have to be 25 years old. Yeah, which doesn't make any sense\""]
["16:07,320","16:13,420","\"Because you can be 18 and buy cigarettes, but you can't be 25 years old and rent a fucking van\""]
["16:13,420","16:17,120","\"Die in a war for your country. Yeah, exactly\""]
["16:17,120","16:23,760","\"But you can't it's just and that makes no sense, but here's another thing too is it's different where you are\""]
["16:23,880","16:26,560","\"They didn't say that on the website when Dylan went there\""]
["16:26,560","16:31,560","\"They didn't say anything about the age requirement for credit. They said they said that after he went there\""]
["16:31,560","16:35,520","\"So when he went to get his mom we waste a time and the family wanted was gone\""]
["16:35,520","16:41,160","\"That sucks and another thing that's fucked up is they have certain times when you can drop the car off\""]
["16:41,160","16:42,320","\"And if you go over it\""]
["16:42,320","16:47,760","\"They'll they'll overcharge you for it and the worst part is you can't drop it off over that time\""]
["16:47,760","16:51,920","\"If you don't get it in with that time window they count it as the next day\""]
["16:52,120","16:57,180","\"So we missed it by like two hours and they were like okay pay a $500 fee because you were late an hour\""]
["16:57,180","17:01,020","\"It's like since we were touring. It's like how the fuck we're gonna plan that ahead\""]
["17:01,020","17:06,520","\"It's like we told them we warned them and they were just like you you have to be here within a certain hour\""]
["17:06,520","17:12,060","\"But they're fucking bank hours were like from three to five. It's like how we supposed to get here within the fucking\""]
["17:12,060","17:15,120","\"Your three hour time period are you fucking kidding me?\""]
["17:15,120","17:22,080","\"So they screwed us up doing that so enterprise sucks if you can find a tour van anywhere else do not\""]
["17:22,080","17:26,160","\"use enterprise. Another thing too is when we got the van, they had all these\""]
["17:26,160","17:30,120","\"things. It's like do you want to pay $12 for like I don't know like an\""]
["17:30,120","17:34,880","\"insurance price you want to pay $150 for to ensure all the items in the van? Do\""]
["17:34,880","17:39,360","\"you want to pay like $150 for us to clean your windows? Do you want like $50\""]
["17:39,360","17:42,840","\"will suck your dick? It's like all this fucking money prices on the guy that you\""]
["17:42,840","17:46,240","\"was like going down an iPad and it was just like tallying up and it's like I\""]
["17:46,240","17:49,280","\"guess we want all this stuff. It's like dude we're not made of money motherfucker\""]
["17:49,280","17:51,280","\"We're trying to tour here. No\""]
["17:51,280","17:55,280","\"It's sorry. No, that's just the start of the tour\""]
["17:55,280","17:57,740","\"I have more stories about the tour, but I don't want to get into that\""]
["17:57,740","18:02,740","\"Like I want to like spread that out like as we're like doing more things. I'm gonna spread you out\""]
["18:02,740","18:07,140","\"Yeah, pink piece of ass, but yeah touring was fine, but like the tour van was not\""]
["18:07,140","18:11,420","\"And like I wish it was bigger and we wanted a bigger one\""]
["18:11,420","18:14,120","\"But we didn't get some dickhead they had like five of them\""]
["18:14,120","18:16,820","\"And they were all gone by the time we got here the only one we could get was like\""]
["18:17,480","18:20,840","\"The smallest one basically I see and we had to make it work\""]
["18:20,840","18:27,740","\"And another thing too is like they don't want you they want one person driving the whole fucking time\""]
["18:27,740","18:34,980","\"Which is complete bullshit like if you're already spending three million dollars on a fucking tour van then fuck you\""]
["18:34,980","18:40,620","\"Anyone fucking drive it. It just means that person is insured and has to pay for the fucking van after what is it matter?\""]
["18:40,620","18:47,000","\"Who fucking drives it? It's like if you're screwed after that whatever it goes on that person's permanent record who gives a shit?\""]
["18:47,000","18:51,140","\"Like I don't understand that I'll get that I don't know what that is. Oh, it's a money thing Chris\""]
["18:51,140","18:54,760","\"I mean just like with anything insurance the whole goal of it is to\""]
["18:54,760","19:02,600","\"Not actually fulfill their end. Yeah, no dude insurance is a joke. Yeah, I could I could go on a fucking rant about insurance\""]
["19:02,600","19:07,280","\"Recently with like st. Louis like the st. Louis flooding\""]

["19:29,060","19:33,980","\"That's the fire thing we should fire fire. Okay. Go and PPO Neil. I actually\""]
["19:33,980","19:39,040","\"Touring was a was really fun. It was quite the experience\""]
["19:41,240","19:43,780","\"You know, it's funny. This is actually really hilarious\""]
["19:43,780","19:48,020","\"When we first talked about like how I was in a band\""]
["19:48,020","19:52,720","\"Nobody even fucking knew we were but people still found us because I said we were in a band\""]
["19:52,720","19:53,480","\"Oh, really?\""]
