["08:51,520","08:57,160","\"We had a rat that would always climb our bird feeder and eat the food and our bird feeders right at the kitchen window\""]
["08:57,160","09:02,120","\"Where everyone can see it like you pretty much have to look at it while you're reading and so this rat would climb up\""]

["09:05,160","09:07,280","\"And we'd like open the window and scream at the rat\""]
["09:07,280","09:12,200","\"And he wouldn't even like drop her and he would just look at us and like kind of look look confused while we screamed at it\""]
["09:12,200","09:16,960","\"So he would just keep eating the bird food and then my mom was like she called her brother Jimmy\""]
["09:16,960","09:21,360","\"And she was like Jimmy can you come over and get rid of this rat for us in my uncle\""]
["09:21,360","09:25,300","\"Jimmy was like are you sure he can marry it and then he came over and he brought a shotgun and\""]
["09:25,300","09:32,080","\"He brought over all my little cousins and we were all just like looking at the window at this fucking rat\""]
["09:32,080","09:35,480","\"Just eating the food and he's just like slowly walking up behind it with a shotgun\""]
["09:35,480","09:42,920","\"And he aimed it at the fucking rat and then suddenly the entire window just exploded with blood and it was fucking amazing\""]
["09:42,920","09:50,160","\"That's my rat story. I'm surprised like the shot didn't break the window. Yeah, I don't really know how he did that\""]
["09:50,160","09:55,440","\"Maybe it was like some kind of like concentrated shot rifle thing. I don't really look like a shotgun\""]
["09:55,440","09:59,520","\"Maybe I'm misremembering but it could have been like a quailing gun or something\""]
["09:59,520","10:03,000","\"I think it was kind of risky to aim it right like you know at the rat through the window\""]
["10:03,000","10:04,520","\"I don't know how he did that\""]
["10:04,520","10:06,240","\"Maybe he was aiming down\""]
["10:06,240","10:10,040","\"Maybe your uncle and I don't want to put thoughts in your head\""]
["10:10,040","10:15,120","\"But maybe he sees in slow motion like maybe he can see like the fucking wings of a B flap\""]
["10:15,120","10:19,020","\"I definitely remember a little gut spraying on the window that it was funny. That's fucking metal\""]
