["00:04,000","00:07,000","\"We haven't put down any bear traps yet.\""]
["00:07,000","00:08,000","\"I'm waiting for him.\""]
["00:08,000","00:09,000","\"No, yeah, we haven't.\""]
["00:09,000","00:10,000","\"We have an opportunity to.\""]
["00:10,000","00:12,000","\"He's supposedly a track dimmed.\""]
["00:12,000","00:16,000","\"I think you need, in order to put down a bait a bear trap, you need ten meat, right?\""]
["00:16,000","00:17,000","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["00:17,000","00:19,000","\"This guy jumps like a frog and he's a limpy and runner.\""]
["00:19,000","00:21,000","\"How can he even put a bear trap down?\""]
["00:21,000","00:22,000","\"Pramptively.\""]
["00:22,000","00:23,000","\"He also had a bear.\""]
["00:23,000","00:24,000","\"That's why big bro is it.\""]
["00:24,000","00:27,000","\"I think in this game the bear trap attracts him.\""]
["00:27,000","00:29,240","\"Do you put your own meat on the bear trap or something?\""]
["00:29,240","00:30,480","\"How do you actually attract the birdie?\""]
["00:30,480","00:31,040","\"I'm not sure.\""]
["00:31,040","00:33,320","\"I guess we got to just try doing it.\""]
["00:33,320","00:35,600","\"It might be a good idea to do that actually putting meat\""]
["00:35,600","00:37,720","\"on a bear trap or just to put your foot on there.\""]
["00:37,720","00:39,920","\"If you put it in like a bush or something,\""]
["00:39,920","00:40,920","\"you might step on it yourself.\""]
["00:40,920","00:42,520","\"Is that the little whispery thing?\""]
["00:42,520","00:43,600","\"What's that?\""]
["00:43,600","00:45,440","\"That was just-- Shut up saying.\""]
["00:45,440","00:46,800","\"That was classic.\""]

["01:08,480","01:09,480","\"*groaning*\""]
["01:09,480","01:13,480","\"I thought it was a little suspicious that it was a grey dog when it's always been a Labrador, Jesus Christ.\""]
["01:13,480","01:18,480","\"I was gonna say that that was disguised as the dog that leads you to him, right?\""]
["01:18,480","01:19,480","\"Oh shit, what's that?\""]
["01:19,480","01:21,480","\"It normally leads you to him.\""]
["01:21,480","01:24,080","\"What a fucking psycho. Just a wolf.\""]
["01:24,080","01:25,680","\"That's what it gets.\""]
["01:25,680","01:26,620","\"Oh no.\""]
["01:26,620","01:28,520","\"Oh did he call his friends?\""]
["01:28,520","01:29,240","\"It would do that.\""]
["01:29,240","01:30,640","\"He saw you from the distance.\""]
["01:30,640","01:33,880","\"That's quite the long death house for something that got insta-kill.\""]
["01:33,880","01:35,600","\"That wasn't even the same wolf that did it.\""]
["01:35,600","01:37,600","\"Oh it was his buddy.\""]
["01:37,600","01:38,040","\"Morning.\""]
["01:38,040","01:39,680","\"All right skinwalker I see.\""]
["01:39,680","01:42,560","\"You don't even want to get the meat.\""]
["01:42,560","01:43,720","\"I'm looking for it.\""]
["01:43,720","01:45,080","\"You must use the whole animal.\""]
["01:45,080","01:46,760","\"Did you shoot at any point?\""]
["01:46,760","01:47,760","\"Chris you should eat.\""]
["01:47,760","01:48,720","\"You have a lot of meat.\""]
["01:48,720","01:49,840","\"But you eat.\""]
["01:49,840","01:50,600","\"You got a lot of meat.\""]

["01:56,080","02:00,180","\"menu real quick can we look at the shit what am I in craft he wants to buy\""]
["02:00,180","02:04,880","\"plus right so oh we got no more totems I guess they don't I guess the ideas you\""]
["02:04,880","02:08,520","\"put down the trap and then you need 10 meat in order to bait it I think the\""]
["02:08,520","02:14,040","\"10 well let's find out I might be misremembering that I guess first find\""]
["02:14,040","02:19,120","\"first find a place to put the trap 10 means a little excessive I would\""]
["02:19,120","02:23,440","\"Think like fucking three at most let's go save we got a shot on them after all\""]
["02:23,440","02:27,960","\"Oh, yeah, good point. You got to save at this camp here at the edge of the lake\""]
["02:27,960","02:33,020","\"There's always this freaking bird here that bird always comes for you if you're if you're sprinting like that\""]
["02:33,020","02:38,440","\"Look up in the air Chris. You might be fucking doing something. Yeah, it's already coming down. It's always on the totem\""]
["02:38,440","02:40,680","\"It's dive bomb. Is it he usually was?\""]
["02:43,400","02:45,760","\"Per saving you shall receive what's that?\""]

["02:51,440","02:57,320","\"We've one of those like free models from miss that\""]
["02:57,320","03:01,240","\"You see it says you need ten raw meat to place a fresh meat pot\""]
["03:01,240","03:06,000","\"Well, why didn't even say that I don't know is it just like a random tip?\""]
["03:06,000","03:10,520","\"Should we do a bear trap right here try throwing down a trap and see what?\""]
["03:11,640","03:16,040","\"What the significance like like I just don't know how the trap stuff works\""]
["03:16,040","03:22,720","\"My guess is adding more meat increases the radius it can use it can attract stuff\""]
["03:22,720","03:31,720","\"Hungry I was gonna say can that also attract like a like a wolf or a bear and not just the not these good walker. I guess oh\""]
["03:31,720","03:35,000","\"Where that woodpecker is\""]
["03:35,000","03:37,040","\"What's the ghost?\""]
["03:37,760","03:41,980","\"I thought it had something to do with the weird the weird thing that drains your stamina\""]
["03:41,980","03:45,640","\"That's the super market. I mean if you want to go check\""]
["03:45,640","03:53,200","\"Fuck that's good. I think that might it there's a chance that it's just does that at the last place you encountered the ghost thing\""]
["03:53,200","03:55,680","\"But why not why not go find out?\""]
["03:55,680","04:03,240","\"You're always saying that when you die you'll finally go ghost to be with your you know your daddy phantom phantom\""]
["04:03,240","04:08,000","\"Danny Fenton's daddy fantons daddy fenton's daddy fenton lights\""]
["04:08,000","04:18,360","\"Their fans the Fentonites Danny Fenton I always thought it was kind of clever, but now that I think about it\""]
["04:18,360","04:22,300","\"It's kind of the opposite clever. Yeah, cuz it's like the Danny Fenton is his name\""]
["04:22,300","04:29,840","\"But he's called fantastic gonna say my my plan is actually less based around Danny Fannum and more based around the fairly odd parents\""]
["04:30,520","04:33,600","\"If it's fairly high parents you mean the\""]

["06:17,840","06:19,840","\"That was right fucking next to you.\""]
["06:19,840","06:20,840","\"Chris.\""]
["06:20,840","06:23,440","\"It was literally behind you.\""]
["06:23,440","06:27,160","\"Please for the love of God, it was in that area.\""]
["06:27,160","06:29,160","\"We haven't gone up here yet.\""]
["06:29,160","06:30,800","\"- Get up there.\""]
["06:30,800","06:32,040","\"Yeah, go up that way.\""]
["06:32,040","06:34,680","\"- I can't, it's rocks too big.\""]
["06:34,680","06:36,200","\"- That might be by design Chris.\""]
["06:36,200","06:37,320","\"- I got it, don't worry.\""]
["06:37,320","06:39,280","\"- I feel like this would be hell on your fucking ankles\""]
["06:39,280","06:41,120","\"if you actually did this IRL.\""]
["06:41,120","06:42,320","\"- Me and Corey went for a hike today\""]
["06:42,320","06:45,120","\"and it was .001% inclined and we almost died.\""]
["06:45,120","06:46,720","\"- Yeah, it was basically like this\""]
["06:46,720","06:49,360","\"and we got there at half the time.\""]
["06:49,360","06:50,200","\"- Oh, we were here.\""]
["06:50,200","06:57,080","\"The scary looks for a place this is snakesville. Yeah, remember there was like snakington press birds\""]
["06:57,080","07:03,720","\"Fear did you know it's possible to find other guns really apparently whoa?\""]
["07:03,720","07:07,240","\"Anything beyond that I was just trying to look up what the ghosts do\""]
["07:07,240","07:12,360","\"Where the fucking you find good find what the ghosts do that's what I'm trying to figure out\""]
["07:12,360","07:18,800","\"I don't think you I don't I think you got so spooked that you ran away from this place. I don't think we got to explore a bunch\""]
["07:19,040","07:22,880","\"That was really Jesus Christ everything we get the map that actually fucking scares me\""]
["07:22,880","07:29,640","\"There's that red Davis guy. Oh apparently a ghost increases your max health really according to this\""]
["07:29,640","07:33,800","\"So a ghost and also just the plants the plants. Oh\""]
["07:33,800","07:40,400","\"Look, there's a radio station up here. Oh, that's what that red thing is fuck man. Be careful up. Oh, no\""]
["07:40,400","07:43,240","\"Cultists up. Oh\""]
["07:46,880","07:52,520","\"Layer dude, maybe this would have been a better spot for a safe point. There's a little extra bear trap map updated\""]
["07:52,520","07:57,540","\"Jesus oh this must be where that's a ritual guy. Oh wait a minute\""]
["07:57,540","08:01,480","\"I think if you break that it will attract it like it'll bring you the location\""]
["08:01,480","08:04,360","\"You do have your back to a wall\""]
["08:04,360","08:07,360","\"gonna do I\""]

["08:18,640","08:21,080","\"It's done. That's where it needs to snap at night\""]
["08:21,080","08:26,040","\"I think it's worth a human with a little human little sacrifices a little fanboy was what happened here\""]
["08:26,040","08:30,400","\"You got chipped up by a sacrifice or you're not hagory. I\""]
["08:30,400","08:37,200","\"Swear that when you break those totems it calls the it said it's coming when he didn't even said it's coming. Yeah\""]
["08:38,480","08:44,880","\"Fuck he's deer. Well, he just crossed one of your totems. He's coming. Oh, he's running. He's mad. He's fucking furious\""]

["09:12,700","09:18,960","\"Aw crap. I literally... I was aiming at him and I shot and I missed him. He went to like the right.\""]
["09:18,960","09:20,960","\"Was on the right\""]
["09:20,960","09:23,840","\"We all saw him we all saw him\""]
["09:23,840","09:29,840","\"It would be scary if we played it with the fucking lights up\""]
["09:29,840","09:36,640","\"So hard there I\""]
["09:36,640","09:42,300","\"Think you find that cave again what you think you can find that cave again\""]
["09:42,300","09:48,540","\"It was over his up Chris was intently leant over clicking. I don't know why I couldn't do it\""]
["09:48,540","09:53,660","\"It was weird because it's fucking scary. It's fine. Totally. I'm just paralyzed with fear. It's all right\""]
["09:53,660","09:56,060","\"Like I saw him being invisible. I was like fine\""]
["09:56,060","09:59,260","\"You did neither\""]
["09:59,260","10:05,780","\"In any situation, yeah, I would not be backed up to a cave with a gun and my sights forward\""]
["10:05,780","10:08,780","\"That makes\""]
["10:08,780","10:12,340","\"Having a wall to your back means that nothing can sneak up on\""]
["10:16,140","10:19,140","\"I would put bear traps in front of the door.\""]
["10:19,140","10:22,140","\"Oh, on both the left hand right side.\""]
["10:22,140","10:23,140","\"Can he get caught inside?\""]
["10:23,140","10:24,140","\"I don't know, like, they just attract?\""]
["10:24,140","10:25,140","\"I think he jumps over it.\""]
["10:25,140","10:26,140","\"He's got giant, like, leap into your legs.\""]
["10:26,140","10:29,140","\"Yeah, I'm not if you smack his little wood at ornament.\""]
["10:29,140","10:31,140","\"They do give you a free bear trap there.\""]
["10:31,140","10:34,140","\"It might as well just throw it down just to see what happens.\""]

["10:43,140","10:45,140","\"Try to find that snake before you break it and kill it.\""]
["10:45,140","10:45,980","\"and kill it.\""]
["10:45,980","10:47,860","\"Snake it before you break it.\""]
["10:47,860","10:49,420","\"Unless the snake was just a random--\""]
["10:49,420","10:51,580","\"- I think the snake only shows up once you do that\""]
