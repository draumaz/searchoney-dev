["00:14,000","00:15,000","\"You were talking about beehives before.\""]
["00:15,000","00:16,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:16,000","00:19,000","\"If a single B comes out of this, I'm really mad.\""]

["00:27,000","00:28,000","\"Yep.\""]
["00:28,000","00:29,000","\"There it goes.\""]
["00:29,000","00:30,720","\"See you at hell, bean.\""]
["00:30,720","00:33,640","\"I don't like it when they kill dogs like that.\""]
["00:33,640","00:36,400","\"To be fair, those are like those spitters from Jurassic Park.\""]
["00:36,400","00:37,400","\"They're scary.\""]
["00:37,400","00:38,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:38,400","00:40,240","\"There's always like an alien dog animal.\""]
["00:40,240","00:43,440","\"It was just like a dog, but he has some sort of like dinosaur.\""]
["00:43,440","00:45,000","\"He's got some kind of mental illness.\""]
["00:45,000","00:46,000","\"You're so right.\""]
["00:46,000","00:47,000","\"He refuses to get help.\""]

["00:49,760","00:54,760","\"And now these ones are weird monster lizards.\""]
["00:54,760","00:57,320","\"Also those spiders.\""]
["00:57,320","00:59,320","\"There was something similar to it in Conqueror's Bad Fur Day.\""]
["00:59,320","01:00,320","\"Yeah?\""]
["01:00,320","01:04,400","\"There was like things that run up on you and then duck down and explode.\""]
["01:04,400","01:08,040","\"To be fair, with the number of comparisons you've drawn, I'm pretty convinced that this\""]
["01:08,040","01:10,560","\"game just is a reskin of Conqueror's Bad Fur Day.\""]
["01:10,560","01:12,120","\"This game is the ultimate game.\""]
["01:12,120","01:14,120","\"You never have to play another game ever again.\""]
["01:14,120","01:18,040","\"If you only played this game for your experience of playing a shooter for the first time, you\""]
["01:18,040","01:20,840","\"would think shooters were insanely fun.\""]
["01:20,840","01:25,920","\"And then you would come to a stark realization that most shooters are pretty redundant.\""]
["01:25,920","01:26,920","\"That was awesome.\""]
["01:26,920","01:27,920","\"That was awesome.\""]
["01:27,920","01:29,920","\"That wasn't what I meant to do.\""]

["01:30,920","01:31,920","\"Oh no!\""]
["01:31,920","01:32,920","\"You did it!\""]
["01:32,920","01:33,920","\"Don't worry about it.\""]
["01:33,920","01:35,920","\"Look at this place.\""]
["01:35,920","01:36,920","\"It's falling apart.\""]
["01:36,920","01:37,920","\"Maybe you made it bigger.\""]
["01:37,920","01:38,920","\"Crowned down.\""]
["01:38,920","01:39,920","\"This place freaking sucks.\""]

["01:41,920","01:42,920","\"What?\""]
["01:42,920","01:47,440","\"What would you do if you were out in the backyard and you notice the rustling in the bushes,\""]
["01:47,440","01:51,360","\"you walk over and out steps the nine foot tall big foot.\""]
["01:51,360","01:52,880","\"What is extended pinky?\""]
["01:52,880","01:55,400","\"Is he extending his pinky to me?\""]
["01:55,400","01:57,400","\"Yeah, he wants you to make a promise with him.\""]
["01:57,400","01:58,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:58,400","01:59,400","\"Okay, I'll make a promise.\""]
["01:59,400","02:00,400","\"Okay, he's promises...\""]
["02:00,400","02:04,400","\"I want you to be my big friend forever.\""]
["02:04,400","02:06,400","\"Do you want to be best friends with Bigfoot?\""]
["02:06,400","02:07,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:07,400","02:08,400","\"I wouldn't say Big Mac.\""]
["02:08,400","02:09,400","\"I would honestly...\""]
["02:09,400","02:12,400","\"I would do that, but I'd be afraid that the second I leave,\""]
["02:12,400","02:14,400","\"Pinky in hand with him,\""]
["02:14,400","02:15,400","\"Poachers would find him,\""]
["02:15,400","02:18,400","\"and then those Bigfoot shows would finally have their first Bigfoot.\""]
["02:18,400","02:21,400","\"But then Corey, after you promised to be his best friend forever,\""]
["02:21,400","02:23,400","\"you notice an old lady crossing the street,\""]
["02:23,400","02:26,480","\"And he runs over and punches her in her gizzard. Yeah\""]
["02:26,480","02:29,480","\"Now she's dead\""]
["02:29,480","02:32,840","\"He knocks out her tooth. He punches her in her gizzard and she's dead\""]
["02:32,840","02:37,680","\"He punches her so hard her face falls off. Well, and he said hiding a body is a real best friend thing to do\""]
["02:37,680","02:42,380","\"So now what you promised to be his best friend forever\""]
["02:42,380","02:48,720","\"Well, I guess I got a hiding old lady's body. What are you gonna fucking not be friends with Bigfoot after being friends with him?\""]
["02:49,240","02:55,000","\"Okay, to be fair there's only one Bigfoot and there's plenty of old ladies in this world if I was in friends with Bigfoot\""]
["02:55,000","02:57,000","\"He would liquidate me in an instant\""]
["02:57,000","03:02,760","\"Thank you. I'll hide the old lady body and I'll even hide her gizzard as well. Okay, Corey\""]
["03:02,760","03:09,900","\"Well, you both pick up the old lady to move her to bury her right yeah, but uh both of your combined strength accidentally rips her in half and\""]
["03:09,900","03:13,600","\"Outfalls your mr. Bean DVD collection\""]
["03:13,600","03:15,640","\"Bigfoot stole it\""]
["03:15,640","03:19,420","\"Well, it's actually Lexi's collection. She has the Mr. Bean DVD collection.\""]
["03:19,420","03:21,340","\"Look, what's something you'd greatly care about?\""]
["03:21,340","03:23,780","\"Outfalls your hard drive from your computer that he's still...\""]
["03:23,780","03:26,940","\"Okay, that, I care greatly about that. Just for all the work I've done.\""]
["03:26,940","03:30,740","\"I'd be like, \"\"Listen, you fucking stupid monkey man. You better give me that hard drive.\"\"\""]
["03:30,740","03:32,240","\"Or, \"\"This friendship is over.\"\"\""]
["03:32,240","03:33,440","\"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.\""]
["03:33,440","03:35,440","\"And he picks it up, but he runs into the woods with it.\""]
["03:35,440","03:36,640","\"He runs into the woods?\""]
["03:36,640","03:37,140","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:37,140","03:38,980","\"I go, \"\"Phew!\"\"\""]

["03:49,860","03:52,500","\"if you got close to him and then he broke his own pinky\""]
["03:52,500","03:54,500","\"and you felt a splitting pain in your stomach\""]
["03:54,500","03:55,580","\"and blacked out?\""]
["03:55,580","03:56,420","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:56,420","03:57,740","\"- That's his power.\""]
["03:57,740","04:00,020","\"- Every time you got close to him, he would do that.\""]
["04:00,020","04:01,620","\"- So I'm connected to Bigfoot now?\""]
["04:01,620","04:04,580","\"- Yeah, just to say that you did the pinky promise.\""]
["04:04,580","04:06,860","\"- I didn't realize that at the time.\""]
["04:06,860","04:08,060","\"He tricked you.\""]
["04:08,060","04:08,900","\"- I'm in hell.\""]
["04:08,900","04:10,620","\"- Holy shit, look at that.\""]

["04:19,340","04:21,420","\"- If she had a surprised expression on her face,\""]
["04:21,420","04:22,540","\"I would keep her under my bed\""]

["05:56,760","06:03,440","\"Alright, so what I was saying was if they made Titanfall 3, they should just go crazy and just make you go to different parts of the country\""]
["06:03,440","06:08,560","\"where you go to like Britain and like Japan and you just bet.\""]
["06:08,560","06:12,320","\"So I'm just saying not America, but you go different parts of the world.\""]
["06:12,320","06:16,120","\"And you just like fight in like those rural areas.\""]
["06:16,120","06:18,040","\"That would be sick as fuck.\""]
["06:18,040","06:20,240","\"That would be kind of cool.\""]

["06:29,780","06:31,180","\"Yeah, it's just really good\""]
["06:31,180","06:33,020","\"And then it starts like getting really clever\""]
["06:33,020","06:36,740","\"There are some things that you can't do in the campaign though that you can do in the multiplayer\""]
["06:36,740","06:40,780","\"Like you can jump on your mech shoulders and give it a back rub and stuff in the multiplayer\""]
