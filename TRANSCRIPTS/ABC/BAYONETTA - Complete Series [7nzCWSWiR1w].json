["09:15,720","09:18,020","\"- That's definitely one of my tastes.\""]
["09:18,020","09:20,880","\"I don't think I, I really can't see spaghetti\""]
["09:20,880","09:23,000","\"and ice cream going together.\""]
["09:23,000","09:23,840","\"- What about mint, though?\""]
["09:23,840","09:25,720","\"- Maybe I just lack imagination.\""]
["09:25,720","09:28,560","\"- There's a lot of overlap between like fancy chefs\""]
["09:28,560","09:30,840","\"and pregnant women of just like mixing shit\""]
["09:30,840","09:32,580","\"that shouldn't taste good together.\""]
["09:32,580","09:36,080","\"Like the old pickles and ice cream stereotype.\""]
["09:36,080","09:37,320","\"- Kinda, yeah.\""]
["09:37,320","09:40,160","\"No, it's a steak with a licorice reduction.\""]

["10:03,760","10:05,360","\"- I think it's awful.\""]
["10:05,360","10:06,200","\"- Me too.\""]
["10:06,200","10:09,280","\"He's genuinely one of the worst flavors in the world.\""]
["10:09,280","10:12,120","\"To me it feels like it's plastic before it hardens.\""]
["10:12,120","10:14,360","\"I think it was a medicinal herb.\""]
["10:14,360","10:19,160","\"I don't even think it was meant to be a sweet.\""]
["10:19,160","10:20,360","\"You collect sonic rings?\""]

["10:34,000","10:40,360","\"Is there any of Sonic's friends that'll go to heaven? No, you know what? I don't think Miles Tails' power will go to heaven. Oh dude\""]
["10:40,360","10:42,360","\"He's a scientist of course not\""]
["10:42,360","10:45,260","\"Big the cattle probably go\""]
["10:45,260","10:49,200","\"He lives a peaceful life and only loves his frog. What about all the fish?\""]

["10:56,520","11:02,980","\"Is that frog or mail? I don't know. Yeah, there's some kind of like inter-speciation there\""]
["11:02,980","11:04,980","\"I don't know if God would be alright with that\""]
["11:04,980","11:09,500","\"He gets all uppity when you mix linens and silks, so that's just niche\""]
["11:09,500","11:16,620","\"Is that really a thing in the Bible about linens and silks it? Yeah, you're not supposed to mix fabrics. I don't know\""]
["11:16,620","11:20,420","\"I forgot that that was a biblical thing, but yeah, I guess the Amish are real into that, huh?\""]
["11:20,420","11:25,380","\"Oh, that looks so cool if I'm doing a combo and I just hold the button she'll just like start shooting\""]
["11:25,380","11:27,740","\"It looks so good\""]
["11:27,740","11:30,380","\"So that that's that's like what is that the foot guns\""]

["11:34,980","11:38,920","\"Yeah, no, they're real cool, and then this is what I was trying to do earlier\""]
["11:38,920","11:43,220","\"I don't think it's quite as cool as the blade mode, but it's like this game is like equivalent of it\""]
["11:43,220","11:48,440","\"Can you make her fight so hard or hair falls out actually literally? Yes, okay cool\""]
["11:48,440","11:54,300","\"Her uh her whole clothes is her hair and it comes off if she does something cool enough is that real?\""]
["11:54,300","11:58,780","\"Yeah, her whole clothes is her hair. Yeah, that must be so uncomfortable\""]
["11:58,780","12:01,500","\"You'd be getting sweaty like ass particles in your air.\""]

["18:49,860","18:50,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["18:50,860","18:51,860","\"Actually who did it first?\""]

["18:52,860","18:53,860","\"Devil May Cry.\""]
["18:53,860","18:55,700","\"Devil May Cry just because it's a much older game.\""]

["19:41,140","19:45,140","\"Oh yeah, guess you're right. I might have been in high school when that came out.\""]

["20:08,780","20:12,380","\"remember they showed like a really cool thing. It was it was like one of those things that like\""]

["20:31,700","20:34,220","\"And then it was Wind Waker, and it was super cartoony,\""]
["20:34,220","20:35,780","\"and I was like, \"\"I hate this!\"\"\""]

["39:16,640","39:18,320","\"Yeah, I was gonna say, I was in a similar thing,\""]
["39:18,320","39:20,360","\"but my parents told me I couldn't get it.\""]
["39:20,360","39:23,200","\"And then I wound up not caring.\""]
["39:23,200","39:24,760","\"'Cause like, my mom and dad bring me up\""]
["39:24,760","39:26,500","\"to a weird Airsoft store.\""]

["39:57,340","40:00,700","\"And my logic was just like, well, it's still all sand,\""]
["40:00,700","40:01,700","\"so who cares?\""]
["40:01,700","40:03,060","\"- Also, they're gonna learn a lot\""]

["58:42,280","58:49,040","\"Like when you're when you're balancing a competitive game you need things like shotguns or like the newtube and call it duty\""]
["58:49,040","58:53,000","\"Yeah, but like they're usually not the best thing in the game\""]
["58:53,000","58:56,300","\"But they give people that are like new players like some kind of a shot\""]
["58:56,300","59:01,160","\"Yeah, so they're not totally fucking screwed. You're talking about MLG shit. Just play games\""]
["59:01,160","59:03,380","\"Yeah, they don't have the shotgun enabled\""]
["59:03,380","59:09,160","\"But I mean even something like like Street Fighter has like you can like spam sure you can and get pretty far like even\""]
["59:09,160","59:14,000","\"Even with people that kind of know what they're doing. Yeah, I was gonna say I've always been a better\""]

["59:31,720","59:33,520","\"You know what they did with on the Fontaine\""]
["59:33,520","59:35,680","\"Apparently they had they'd have a shotgun\""]
["59:35,680","59:37,760","\"Boided like straight down to his throat\""]
["59:37,760","59:41,480","\"Yeah, and then they'd have and then they'd have like a u87 in front of his mouth\""]
["59:41,480","59:44,760","\"Oh, that's really genius and then made so they'd use like both\""]

["59:54,420","59:56,860","\"- Now, was that his technique that he would,\""]
["59:56,860","59:58,300","\"if you hired him, tell you about?\""]
["59:58,300","01:00:00,340","\"Or did just everyone know how to do that?\""]
["01:00:00,340","01:00:02,160","\"- I think that was his like technique.\""]
["01:00:02,160","01:00:04,140","\"Like this is something that he and whatever engineers\""]
["01:00:04,140","01:00:05,900","\"he worked with like worked out\""]
["01:00:05,900","01:00:08,540","\"was the best possible way to present his voice.\""]
["01:00:08,540","01:00:10,140","\"- That's really cool.\""]
["01:00:10,140","01:00:12,740","\"What if I point the mic in my eyeballs?\""]
