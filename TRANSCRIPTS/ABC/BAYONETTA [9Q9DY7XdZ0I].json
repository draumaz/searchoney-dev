["17:59,900","18:01,900","\"What's all this crud?\""]
["18:01,900","18:07,900","\"I think there's some kind of like crafting thing, like some light crafting.\""]
["18:07,900","18:08,900","\"I'm not sure.\""]
["18:08,900","18:10,900","\"Has the game ever said crud obtain?\""]
["18:10,900","18:11,900","\"For every object you pick up.\""]

["18:15,900","18:17,900","\"Crud obtain.\""]
["18:17,900","18:20,300","\"And every single object in the game.\""]
["18:20,300","18:24,060","\"It's just called \"\"Cred in the Database\"\".\""]
["18:24,060","18:25,180","\"That friggin' rocks.\""]
["18:25,180","18:28,460","\"My idea. You can't have it.\""]
["18:28,460","18:32,060","\"Look at his hands.\""]
["18:32,060","18:33,660","\"He's going into blue mode.\""]
["18:33,660","18:37,260","\"I like how the aesthetic of this game is amazing.\""]
["18:37,260","18:38,540","\"Everything looks so cool.\""]
["18:38,540","18:42,940","\"Yeah, I always really like the enemy designs.\""]
["18:42,940","18:44,140","\"And they make it...\""]
["18:44,140","18:45,980","\"They do that thing where they kind of like\""]
["18:45,980","18:52,640","\"Highlight every new enemy you face sort of like Devil May Cry. Yeah, actually who did it first them or Devil May Cry?\""]
["18:52,640","18:58,520","\"Probably Devil May Cry just because it's a much older game. I think the guy who designed this actually worked on\""]
["18:58,520","19:01,980","\"The original Devil May Crys. Oh, okay.\""]
["19:01,980","19:09,200","\"I think that's that's where he came from. I could be totally wrong on that, but I know that\""]
["19:09,200","19:13,720","\"Platinum was a bunch of like ex like Clover Studio people who did like\""]
["19:15,260","19:17,260","\"Beautiful Joe and they did\""]
["19:17,260","19:21,480","\"It's a beautiful Joe is the game that like I never really got that into it\""]
["19:21,480","19:26,540","\"But it did have great style if they were like remastered that it would look so good nowadays\""]
["19:26,540","19:31,680","\"I think they could really nail like the cartonias that I for sure would like the guilty gear kind of shit\""]
["19:31,680","19:37,520","\"Yeah, I was gonna say yeah shaders have come a long way since what was beautiful Joe like 2006\""]
["19:37,520","19:40,360","\"7 maybe even earlier\""]
["19:41,340","19:43,020","\"Oh, yeah, guess you're right.\""]
["19:43,020","19:45,020","\"I might've been in high school when I came out.\""]
["19:45,020","19:49,140","\"- It was when cell shading was like first really taking off.\""]
["19:49,140","19:51,380","\"I remember when I first saw a cell shading,\""]
["19:51,380","19:53,060","\"I absolutely hated it.\""]
["19:53,060","19:54,340","\"- It used to look really bad.\""]
["19:54,340","19:55,940","\"- I was still pretty impressed by it.\""]
["19:55,940","19:57,380","\"- The first time I saw Wind Waker,\""]
["19:57,380","20:00,100","\"I was like, \"\"What the fuck is this?\"\"\""]
["20:00,100","20:01,740","\"- No, I had a heart on for it\""]
["20:01,740","20:04,620","\"'cause I had always wanted like games\""]
["20:04,620","20:06,780","\"that look more like cartoons.\""]
["20:06,780","20:08,460","\"- Yeah, I liked it when I actually played it,\""]
["20:08,460","20:10,820","\"but I remember they showed like a really cool thing.\""]
["20:10,820","20:18,300","\"It was like one of those things that like your friend puts on a fucking like burns to a DVD and it like shows it to people\""]
["20:18,300","20:25,460","\"Yeah, it was like this cool like III thing with like link fighting Ganondorf. Do you remember that? I remember that yeah before\""]
["20:25,460","20:29,300","\"Wind waker and it looked so fucking cool and I was like\""]
["20:29,300","20:36,900","\"And then it it was Wind waker and it was super cartoony and I was like I hate this and then I played it and I liked it\""]
["20:36,900","20:41,960","\"Yeah, I never I never saw that so I never got hyped like that and then the Twilight Princess trailer came out\""]
["20:41,960","20:47,100","\"No, it was exactly what I wanted and it was like, oh, this is gonna be so cool and then it was okay\""]
["20:47,100","20:51,740","\"Yeah, yeah, I never thought Twilight Princess was bad. It's just not very memorable\""]
["20:51,740","20:58,920","\"It has one of the fucking slowest openings of any Zelda game though. Oh, yeah, I always forget about that. So boring\""]
["20:58,920","21:04,280","\"Yeah, I wish they just kind of dropped you right into it and just introduced all the mechanics at once\""]
["21:05,500","21:09,100","\"It does pick up like a lot though, but it's not my favorite\""]
["21:09,100","21:12,220","\"There's no need to cry dude\""]
["21:12,220","21:21,040","\"I don't know I think it'd be good the book of revelations is gonna look like mother goose and then I'm gonna fuck the goose\""]
["21:21,040","21:25,260","\"He's shaking around a little bit\""]
