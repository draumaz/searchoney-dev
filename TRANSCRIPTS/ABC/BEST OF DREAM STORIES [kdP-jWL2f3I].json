["09:06,940","09:07,820","\"Did you? I don't remember that.\""]
["09:07,820","09:12,780","\"I went to bed and like I never ever ever sleep on my back because every time I do I have a hallucination.\""]
["09:12,780","09:14,300","\"That's a good way to get sleep paralysis.\""]
["09:14,300","09:15,500","\"Yeah, that's interesting.\""]
["09:15,500","09:19,840","\"And so that this one time I was like, well, it's been like fucking three years since I tried napping on my back\""]

["34:05,360","34:08,560","\"But I know that was just my brain playing tricks on me because I was thinking that it\""]
["34:08,560","34:09,560","\"would be like...\""]
["34:09,560","34:10,560","\"Were you in the dark like the dead of the dark dark?\""]

["34:19,060","34:23,760","\"It was like something out of a horror movie where the light only shine on a dumbass weird face.\""]
["34:23,760","34:25,560","\"Is this like sleep paralysis or something?\""]
["34:25,560","34:26,560","\"No, I was awake.\""]
["34:26,560","34:30,700","\"I was leaning on my bed looking at it hoping it didn't blink and then it just\""]

["34:45,320","34:47,080","\"Yeah, and I was thinking\""]
["34:47,080","34:47,880","\"And it's falling into the door?\""]
["34:47,880","34:51,040","\"No, no, no, he used to walk by our house all the time\""]

["34:54,520","34:55,560","\"Mmm\""]
["34:55,560","35:02,120","\"And he did that like constantly so he died a day before he usually got the lawnmower\""]
["35:02,120","35:02,920","\"Oh\""]
["35:02,920","35:05,800","\"So the next day when I was asleep at night\""]

["35:49,480","35:54,360","\"I think there's someone look will stand in over me. That's happened with like a coat rack definitely with like weird like\""]
["35:54,360","35:58,920","\"Like raincoats and shit really give off weird illusion because when you stand my room in the main\""]
["35:58,920","36:02,300","\"Like for entrance when you come into like my mom's house my room\""]
["36:02,300","36:04,140","\"- He used to be right there and there was a coat rack.\""]

["36:17,580","36:20,020","\"and like little people on horses at the bottom.\""]
["36:20,020","36:21,020","\"And I used to just look at it\""]
["36:21,020","36:23,580","\"and they'd be like walking around and like moving\""]
["36:23,580","36:26,060","\"and the trees would be swaying and it would just be like scary.\""]

["36:28,540","36:30,460","\"any kind of shadow that's like moving creates\""]
["36:30,460","36:33,540","\"like the illusion that it's like it's your brain.\""]
["36:33,540","36:35,640","\"That's why when people say like I saw shadows at night\""]
["36:35,640","36:38,100","\"when I was in a place alone with no one else there\""]
