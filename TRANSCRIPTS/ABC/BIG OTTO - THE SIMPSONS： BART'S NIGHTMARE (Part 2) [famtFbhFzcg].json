["05:19,280","05:23,800","\"So I had to learn this stupid thing inside and out now what it was it just because they were like oh\""]
["05:23,800","05:29,480","\"We don't want to keep buying you new things. Yes, and it's fair games were expensive games still are expensive\""]
["05:29,480","05:30,960","\"They're getting more expensive too.\""]
["05:30,960","05:31,800","\"- Yeah, definitely.\""]
["05:31,800","05:33,280","\"- Some studios want to increase prices.\""]
["05:33,280","05:35,480","\"- I grew up poor, I could only have a couple of games,\""]
["05:35,480","05:38,280","\"so if they sucked, it would have been bad.\""]
["05:38,280","05:41,680","\"- Should games not be getting more expensive?\""]
["05:41,680","05:48,400","\"- With inflation and with how much games cost to make now?\""]
["05:48,400","05:50,400","\"- I mean, the thing is, it's that budgets\""]
["05:50,400","05:51,640","\"have been running out of control\""]
["05:51,640","05:52,840","\"because everything keeps improving\""]
["05:52,840","05:54,200","\"and getting more expensive.\""]
["05:54,200","05:57,480","\"Well, it was the budget again for GTA 5,\""]
["05:57,480","05:58,840","\"like half a billion or something.\""]
["05:58,840","06:01,800","\"Yeah, but they made like, they made so much more.\""]
["06:01,800","06:02,920","\"- Well, sure, they made the money,\""]
["06:02,920","06:04,480","\"but it also means you're putting all that trouble\""]
["06:04,480","06:06,080","\"and effort and time into it.\""]
["06:06,080","06:09,000","\"All those developers working on crunch and everything too.\""]
["06:09,000","06:10,600","\"It really sucks for that.\""]
["06:10,600","06:13,280","\"Especially because a lot of them aren't getting paid that much\""]
["06:13,280","06:14,840","\"in a lot of positions.\""]
["06:14,840","06:16,240","\"It's really thankless work.\""]
["06:16,240","06:18,760","\"- I guess that's a good point.\""]
["06:18,760","06:23,280","\"Whether or not the inflation should be going that drastically\""]
["06:23,280","06:25,400","\"would come down to like, okay, how is the pay getting?\""]
["06:25,400","06:27,680","\"- Well, yeah, are you actually properly paying them?\""]
["06:27,680","06:32,640","\"the people working out of the executives that are they taking a second raise for themselves\""]
["06:32,640","06:38,160","\"get another 21 million bonus at the end of the year. I would say it's probably excessive because\""]
["06:38,160","06:42,720","\"whenever I see fucking I need to use one of the ones practicing it so I don't really have faith\""]
["06:42,720","06:46,880","\"in that three in the game awards whenever I see those fucking stages with like 50 foot screens\""]
["06:46,880","06:53,120","\"I'm like this is I don't think this is called for but julian they take so much money from\""]

["07:11,720","07:13,920","\"The Dorito Pope thing never happened.\""]
["07:13,920","07:15,920","\"I don't know how it happened, but what happened?\""]
["07:15,920","07:16,920","\"What happened?\""]
["07:16,920","07:19,320","\"Yeah, it's because what happened was Jeff Kealey did a video\""]
["07:19,320","07:22,720","\"where he's like, cold, dead gays looking at the camera\""]
["07:22,720","07:25,780","\"sitting in a chair and he has, was it?\""]

["07:41,440","07:42,360","\"What's the difference?\""]
["07:42,360","07:44,360","\"- Yeah, just do it. - Just be the Dorito Pope.\""]
