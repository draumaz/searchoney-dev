["33:56,960","34:02,040","\"You know, I think achievements are good when they like add replay value were fun like things to try\""]
["34:02,040","34:07,100","\"I think the game should have its own achievement list in the game itself not as part of the dashboard\""]
["34:07,100","34:10,760","\"You know what I like about achievements is when you do an achievement and\""]
["34:10,760","34:13,480","\"And you do a certain amount and you unlock stuff for the achievement.\""]

["38:48,060","38:51,460","\"But I will give credit where credit is due getting those achievements\""]
["38:51,460","38:55,660","\"Rewards you with an item in the game. That's pretty cool. Every achievement is an item in the game\""]
["38:55,660","39:04,440","\"I feel like getting getting actual in-game rewards that alter the gameplay for a fresh experience is the peak of design for that kind\""]
["39:04,440","39:07,740","\"I mean, that's why you're feeling rewarded. It's not because of the achievement itself\""]
["39:07,740","39:11,980","\"Exactly achievement was gone and you still got the item you feel the exact same way. No, yeah\""]
["39:11,980","39:18,860","\"I guess I also do kind of feel like I accomplished something when I look at my like 800 achievements from binding of Isaac\""]
["39:18,860","39:24,940","\"And I'm like nice. I play this game for 600 hours, and I got nearly everything right and no one else will care about me\""]
["39:24,940","39:29,180","\"Well own way. I'm just not the same. It's okay Chris\""]
["39:29,180","39:34,860","\"But I I'm talking about that as my own regard because with Isaac there are some achievements in that game\""]
["39:34,860","39:37,100","\"Then I'm like yeah, I got that achievement\""]
["39:37,100","39:42,780","\"I think you're more achieved at the fact that you you can see that you did it. It's not cuz it's an achievement on your fucking steam\""]
["39:42,780","39:48,200","\"Yeah, well steam also has something that I like where you can see the percentage of people who got the achievement\""]
["39:48,200","39:49,100","\"I like that a lot\""]
["39:49,100","39:54,580","\"You can see like 0.1 percent people but then half the time those achievements are the exact ones you're talking about\""]
["39:54,580","39:58,740","\"Yeah, it's like kill six trillion enemies using this item and it's like well\""]
["39:58,740","40:03,660","\"3% of the people in the world like this. That's like the same as being like like yo\""]
["40:03,660","40:10,400","\"I like I took 15,000 shits like and I feel like we've talked about achievements way too long\""]
["40:10,400","40:15,660","\"It's a good topic. How many people talk about achievements achievement hunter. Yeah, but they're dead. Oh, yeah\""]
["40:15,660","40:19,020","\"They die in a horrible car accident Chris. I didn't want to be remembered of that\""]
["40:19,020","40:22,540","\"Man, that's okay sound they made I\""]
["40:22,540","40:27,780","\"Used to watch achievement hunter and watch some play horse and then they used to do halo fails with a week\""]
["40:27,780","40:30,460","\"Halo that sound I feel like I would have well\""]
["40:30,460","40:33,800","\"I would enjoy that if I knew it existed. I enjoyed it at the time\""]
["40:33,800","40:36,820","\"But now I don't give a shit about halo or achievement hunter\""]
["40:36,820","40:41,560","\"Your life's gone to shit at one point one of those guys was a huge fan of mine\""]
["40:41,560","40:47,060","\"And he asked me to draw a picture of him and I did and then he I think he got but hurt and he's stuff\""]

["41:12,580","41:16,340","\"Fucking idiot\""]
["41:16,340","41:23,900","\"That was arguably the most overpowered fucking move. Yeah, no, all the specials are kind of little broken, but the game's tough. You know, yeah\""]
