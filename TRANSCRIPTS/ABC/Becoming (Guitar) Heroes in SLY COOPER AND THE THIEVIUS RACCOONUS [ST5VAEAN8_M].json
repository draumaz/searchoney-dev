["08:31,800","08:34,480","\"That'd be cool. I'd respect him\""]
["08:34,480","08:42,280","\"True, you know what blows my mind about Chris Chan is I feel like in an in almost every alternate universe\""]
["08:42,280","08:44,280","\"There's not a Chris Chan\""]
["08:45,560","08:54,100","\"Yeah, I think C137 or whatever he fucking says we're called. I think that's the I think they got that directly from Marvel, right?\""]
["08:54,100","09:00,200","\"Maybe that's the Marvel universe where like that's what the Marvel people always say we're on your universe\""]
["09:00,200","09:05,440","\"Depressing if that's the case it is always thought Christian is really clever with his name\""]
["09:05,440","09:10,360","\"Everything from everything is yeah, it's on a shoot dude\""]
["09:11,560","09:17,480","\"Even the dimensional merge like the fucking CPU blue heart is like some quick those catchy\""]
["09:17,480","09:23,020","\"It's just his initials. Yes. It is catchy. It is. It's accidentally good\""]
["09:23,020","09:30,140","\"Good because it's like a sonic thing and quick. It's like fast. Yeah, it is just accidentally genius\""]
["09:30,140","09:36,480","\"Sonichu is accidentally genius because it's like it's almost tongue-in-cheek how autistic it is. It's great. I love it\""]
["09:36,480","09:37,520","\"You know\""]
["09:37,520","09:40,640","\"Here's what I always wondered right. Yeah, let's say\""]
["09:41,040","09:48,740","\"Sony or Nintendo wanted to make a sonichu movie could they do that without consulting Christian?\""]
["09:48,740","09:51,240","\"They'd have to consult Nintendo\""]
["09:51,240","09:56,020","\"I'm saying Nintendo and Sega right they want to make the movie of\""]
["09:56,020","09:57,700","\"Sonichu is\""]
["09:57,700","10:03,760","\"Sonichu technically Chris Chan's intellectual property like would Sega have to get sonichu\""]
["10:03,760","10:05,620","\"approved by\""]
["10:05,620","10:07,620","\"Christian I really can't tell because\""]
["10:08,620","10:13,960","\"They're not like like it's clearly derivative right he says in the comic that he's a Pokemon\""]
["10:13,960","10:21,140","\"Yeah, so if he changed that like feature and if if he said this is my original character sonichu\""]
["10:21,140","10:23,600","\"He probably would have gotten away with it. Oh\""]
["10:23,600","10:32,500","\"Probably that's like something that would have to be resolved in court right because in the comic sonichu is sonic plus pikachu\""]
["10:32,500","10:38,300","\"Yeah, like that's and I bet the court case would depend on whether or not the jury\""]
["10:38,300","10:41,220","\"just accidentally agrees with him or not.\""]
["10:41,220","10:43,700","\"- Yeah. - It would be super 50/50.\""]
["10:43,700","10:44,540","\"- Yeah.\""]
["10:44,540","10:51,860","\"'Cause like, if, let's say I write a Pokemon fan fiction\""]
["10:51,860","10:54,020","\"and they take that and make it into a movie.\""]
["10:54,020","10:54,860","\"- Yeah.\""]
["10:54,860","10:57,980","\"- Right, like I'd have rights to sue for that, right?\""]
["10:57,980","10:58,820","\"- Or-- - Or--\""]
["10:58,820","10:59,660","\"- It depends.\""]
["10:59,660","11:02,740","\"- I bet you would, but you probably wouldn't win.\""]
["11:02,740","11:04,060","\"- Right, 'cause of the--\""]
["11:04,060","11:05,260","\"- 'Cause of the-- - It's a big Nintendo.\""]
["11:05,260","11:07,340","\"- Yeah, the expense of the lawyers and stuff\""]
["11:07,340","11:12,020","\"They probably just have more of them, but yeah, it seems like in a lot of court cases\""]
["11:12,020","11:16,060","\"You can be a hundred percent right, but it just really boils down to whether or not you get a jury\""]
["11:16,060","11:18,320","\"Yeah\""]
["11:18,320","11:23,140","\"It also just kind of sometimes seems to come down to like who has more money\""]
["11:23,140","11:28,180","\"Mm-hmm cuz sometimes you just like don't win that shit. I saw this documentary about\""]
["11:28,180","11:31,860","\"Coca-Cola\""]
["11:31,860","11:36,300","\"Was it Coca-Cola? Yeah, it was or maybe it was Pepsi\""]
["11:36,300","11:37,540","\"I\""]
["11:37,540","11:40,820","\"Don't remember one of them made a commercial where it's like oh yeah\""]
["11:40,820","11:47,660","\"Like you can win prizes for getting points for buying. I think it was Pepsi. I prefer Pepsi. Yeah go on\""]
["11:47,660","11:51,820","\"so they were like you can win prizes with points and\""]
["11:51,820","11:58,500","\"In the commercial they have like for like 70 million points or something you can win a fighter jet\""]
["11:58,500","12:01,020","\"So\""]
["12:01,020","12:05,820","\"Guy actually fucking got the 70 million points or whatever\""]
["12:05,820","12:11,300","\"And asked them for the fighter jet and they were they were like no\""]
["12:11,300","12:15,540","\"So he tried to like take him to court and shit like that\""]
["12:15,540","12:20,340","\"The Simpsons were Berwick's earl for that's probably based on it cuz he was like a low\""]
["12:20,340","12:23,640","\"He was like a celebrity for a little while like he was doing the rounds on news\""]
