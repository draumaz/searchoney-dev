["53:52,640","53:56,260","\"because she started giving me weird looks after that yeah and\""]
["53:58,140","54:03,420","\"so I guess she thought I meant like oh when do you get off the fuck something\""]
["54:03,420","54:10,020","\"like that I was like probably 18 or something so like it wouldn't have been\""]
["54:10,020","54:13,700","\"outside the realm of possibility for somebody else to do that I was like 12\""]

["55:26,140","55:27,500","\"Oh, so that's the first episode\""]
["55:27,500","55:32,020","\"Yeah, and it got real raunchy and then my mom walked out she went you're not allowed to watch this and I was like\""]
["55:32,020","55:34,020","\"I know and it was really embarrassing\""]
["55:34,020","55:41,720","\"I was like I don't even like it. It's not even funny mom. She's a guy. I've talked about guilty pleasure\""]
["55:41,720","55:44,940","\"I'm stuck with you. She just said you know, we shouldn't be watching that\""]
["55:44,940","55:48,660","\"And that's why I moved out\""]
["55:48,660","55:53,540","\"Like wasn't allowed to walk together. That was the inciting incident. So wait it was on MTV over there?\""]
["55:53,540","55:58,920","\"Yeah, that makes sense. It was Comedy Central over here. I think actually maybe it was on I don't know\""]
["55:58,920","56:03,420","\"MTV is directly competing with South Park and they really like talking about it. Yeah, they might be wrong\""]
["56:03,420","56:07,400","\"I forget. They really enjoy South Park. I heard the movies all about how much they love South Park\""]
["56:07,400","56:11,180","\"Remember MTV used to play SpongeBob in Ireland\""]
["56:11,180","56:16,320","\"MTV played Renan Stimpy later on. Mm-hmm. Did they actually? Yeah\""]

["56:27,320","56:28,640","\"- Why not?\""]
["56:28,640","56:31,120","\"- I watched through \"\"Drawn Together\"\" fairly recently\""]
["56:31,120","56:32,880","\"and I'll say that, like I said,\""]
["56:32,880","56:35,880","\"I think hating it is definitely the natural response.\""]
["56:35,880","56:39,200","\"- I like it, but-- - I remember occasionally\""]
["56:39,200","56:41,560","\"it had jokes that were funny, but for the most part,\""]
["56:41,560","56:44,200","\"it was just nothing.\""]
["56:44,200","56:45,200","\"It was just aimlessly frightening.\""]
["56:45,200","56:51,400","\"Definitely when people say offensive for defenselessness say I would definitely say that's probably that is the show to go to for that\""]
["56:51,400","56:54,820","\"Because that's what the movies about they're upset with South Park for having a point\""]
["56:54,820","57:02,700","\"Yeah, I hate the fucking movie it hurts. It sure doesn't it was animated in a flash and it looked okay for flash. That's true\""]
["57:02,700","57:05,440","\"But I animate in flash\""]
["57:05,440","57:08,880","\"And I'm you would probably do better and your I'm way better than run\""]

["01:28:01,860","01:28:04,300","\"I found out about it 'cause it was in the C drive\""]

["01:28:18,220","01:28:25,220","\"Yeah, that's what happened is that a bunch of kids found out about it and they started going in and messing with kids like email accounts and everything.\""]
["01:28:25,220","01:28:31,220","\"And the fact that they had a key logger running already like that's probably why they suspended the kids.\""]
