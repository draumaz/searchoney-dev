["01:42,280","01:45,280","\"Oh my god, how did you actually get it?\""]
["01:45,280","01:46,280","\"That's the easiest thing to get.\""]

["01:48,280","01:49,280","\"Oh, you're right.\""]
["01:49,280","01:50,280","\"That makes sense.\""]
["01:50,280","01:53,280","\"Oh yeah, there's a whole giant trading game that you need to beat the game.\""]
["01:53,280","01:58,560","\"the game. Could you imagine playing a fucking cream game and like everything's moving on\""]
["01:58,560","02:04,440","\"conveyor belts like fuck. You got a ryoshi doll recently he seems to be showing up in\""]
["02:04,440","02:09,240","\"many games. Oh yeah they were all they're already made yeah the Super Mario world was\""]
["02:09,240","02:13,200","\"probably out and then Yoshi and Yoshi I don't know if Yoshi's cookie was that I guess it\""]
["02:13,200","02:17,800","\"would be right because this is like a good color shield what could I get the shield in\""]
["02:17,800","02:22,760","\"that game. I mean I think it's the same shield we already have oh really it's not like\""]
["02:22,760","02:28,420","\"If you like lose it. Oh, you can use okay. No, it's literally the first thing you do the first NPC you talk\""]
["02:28,420","02:32,860","\"I feel like there's maybe a way you can lose your shield like there you wait. Can you get the Ruby? I\""]
["02:32,860","02:38,020","\"Could try how much with the Ruby you want to try it sure. Oh, no\""]
["02:38,020","02:44,680","\"Put that anywhere and then you just got a time it basically you could just tap a let's see and then once you release it\""]
["02:44,680","02:48,060","\"It'll go down, but you got a time it damn it\""]
["02:48,060","02:51,160","\"Wow, it really takes a while down. Oh wow\""]
["02:51,560","02:55,500","\"It's yeah, you really do have to like experiment with it to figure out\""]
["02:55,500","02:59,880","\"Yeah, it's a ripoff at least you got the Yoshi doll abstention\""]
["02:59,880","03:04,520","\"It's gonna say the Yoshi doll is the only thing you really need to get from there. What is it to do?\""]
["03:04,520","03:08,840","\"You gotta write it you trade off to your friends. It's part like I said\""]
["03:08,840","03:13,360","\"It's part of a huge trading game, but I think the Yoshi doll you can give to a little baby. Oh\""]

["03:33,880","03:37,600","\"Maybe you can trade the ribbon for something else. I don't know about you, but when I play games\""]
["03:37,600","03:39,600","\"I always name my characters like\""]
["03:43,800","03:50,760","\"If I can get away with it if you get the name someone else. Yeah, I would just like I would just like this is the fishing mini game\""]

["04:48,420","04:53,520","\"Saying like if you would have done that mini game you would have just broken even cuz those probably would have been 20 rubies, right?\""]
["04:53,520","04:57,680","\"Probably and you might be\""]
["04:57,680","05:03,120","\"Stupid little fish hopefully this guy at least gets me my money back\""]

["09:34,100","09:37,820","\"I mean, yeah, this like the aesthetic of Game Boy colors way better\""]
["09:37,820","09:42,180","\"I don't like the the toy aesthetic for that game. I like it for other games\""]
["09:42,180","09:49,900","\"Does this like they always do like baby vision for stuff like Yoshi's Island has always had this like really babyish craft\""]

["10:48,820","10:53,540","\"Yeah, I heard today that like big fucking massive member was actually a fraud\""]
["10:53,540","10:58,660","\"Yeah, he used like smokes and mirrors to make it seem bigger by like fucking with the camera\""]
["10:58,660","11:07,040","\"Like he can jump look he used to whoa he used the kind of trick like you know where like in coin like coin games\""]
["11:09,020","11:15,380","\"Where anyways, he used like the trunk where the slant of like a coin game where it's actually bent up\""]
["11:15,380","11:19,580","\"That's why the coins aren't falling off. He did the same trick with his dick where his dick was bent up\""]
["11:19,580","11:23,620","\"But the the meter was going down so it looked bigger than actually was. I don't care\""]
["11:23,620","11:25,140","\"He used optical illusions\""]
["11:25,140","11:29,700","\"I think it was cool that he did that and he used he used like the smoothing tool and\""]
["11:29,700","11:33,780","\"There's a lot of the kitchen of people on the internet who wanted to prove that\""]
["11:33,780","11:38,100","\"No, I heard he has like a he definitely probably has like a big dick\""]
["11:38,100","11:42,740","\"But I don't think it's like 10 inches. That's pretty big cuz it's what if it is who cares\""]
["11:42,740","11:47,780","\"How come Steve was led a show is small cog it redacted no let it show is massive\""]
["11:47,780","11:53,860","\"Fair what I'm saying is like there's a difference because like he doctored it to make it seem bigger\""]
["11:53,860","11:57,940","\"Even if he did have a big dick, you know, it also seems like compensating for no reason, but yeah\""]
["11:57,940","12:00,180","\"I don't want to bully redacted good more what about\""]
["12:00,180","12:04,700","\"We could bullet I don't even know him. I feel like I'm being unfair\""]
["12:04,700","12:06,700","\"Yeah, you are\""]
["12:06,700","12:13,580","\"So the easiest way to get these guys if you get them all close and get them with one swing it's honestly\""]
["12:13,580","12:18,560","\"You fucked it you have to get them all the same so what?\""]
["12:18,560","12:25,900","\"Spade then clubs fade then clubs glare. Oh Jesus. It actually goes slower though, which is nice. Oh\""]
