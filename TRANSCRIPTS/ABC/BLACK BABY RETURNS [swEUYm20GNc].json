["09:14,980","09:15,980","\"Oh, he did.\""]
["09:16,220","09:20,380","\"Yeah. Also, I've figured out that if you run to the right of them, they usually miss.\""]

["12:17,660","12:23,740","\"Ever this guy would be particularly difficult. This is where we couldn't get past. Yeah, it was impossible\""]
["12:23,740","12:29,020","\"Hmm I think because I'm up high I need to aim lower\""]
["12:29,020","12:39,700","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh there he goes whoo-hoo-hoo. Okay, yeah, Skane is power. Where's his uh?\""]
["12:39,700","12:48,660","\"What the fuck the axe is behind him. I know but he's supposed to drop a key. It looks like that dead Chris Farley picture the way he's posed\""]
["12:48,660","12:53,300","\"Horrible look at him. Oh\""]
["12:53,300","12:57,140","\"Where's the fucking key? I thought he didn't drop the key I?\""]

["13:28,140","13:30,860","\"I guess it's good that it's there now, right?\""]
["13:30,860","13:35,940","\"Because it's a quick access if you actually need to get back to it like quick access like that. Yeah\""]
["13:35,940","13:41,140","\"Holy\""]
["13:41,140","13:47,580","\"He's gonna be still there. I think he's a walker\""]

["14:07,500","14:14,300","\"Can you pop a shot on his his elbow or something? I'll come back to that. I don't see what's up here. Maybe you killed from this way\""]
["14:14,300","14:19,340","\"Above can't believe it. Oh, yeah, you got a drop down on him like the asylum demon\""]

["14:52,420","14:57,940","\"There you go. Black baby should be able to hold a torch in one hand and an axe in the other would be badass\""]
["14:57,940","15:02,920","\"Fucking stupid this kid is so stupid. He's totally an axe and a fucking torch\""]
["15:02,920","15:11,760","\"What am I just too good at aiming is that with the problem is I'm just incapable of missing a target\""]
["15:11,760","15:14,720","\"As a whole is a lack of a target\""]
["15:14,720","15:18,100","\"You need a fix the sameing dude. I guess my biggest\""]
["15:20,020","15:23,860","\"I'm kind of scared that guy's gonna be like waiting for me kick your ass\""]

["15:49,260","15:53,400","\"See now we have the speedrun. It would actually be probably smart than to leave them alive\""]
["15:53,400","15:56,540","\"Yeah, exactly in case that that guy with the club\""]
["15:56,540","16:03,440","\"Does what he does? Oh my god. Did that follow you? No, that wasn't there when you left. It was just you freaking me out\""]

["16:13,380","16:16,940","\"You think they birth black baby? I think they all collectively\""]
["16:17,340","16:19,940","\"- I think that like baby is just like, he's the,\""]
["16:19,940","16:21,820","\"I think there's some sort of a ritual to this.\""]
["16:21,820","16:25,300","\"- I think they're all fighting over custody of black baby.\""]
["16:25,300","16:28,460","\"- I think they, he's a mutated, like he's a music--\""]
["16:28,460","16:29,460","\"- You can be taken one of them?\""]
["16:29,460","16:30,580","\"- Yeah, I think so.\""]
["16:30,580","16:32,780","\"And then they don't like him 'cause he's different.\""]
["16:32,780","16:36,180","\"- Well that's just the story he would guide in it.\""]
["16:36,180","16:37,200","\"- It's so true.\""]
["16:37,200","16:41,060","\"Come on, what the hell, there you go.\""]

["16:45,380","16:47,940","\"if you're attacking their legs or no.\""]
["16:47,940","16:50,140","\"- No, you always have to hit him in the head.\""]
["16:50,140","16:51,060","\"- Okay.\""]
["16:51,060","16:54,300","\"- Just kind of hard, kind of hard to do.\""]
["16:54,300","16:55,140","\"- Okay, this doesn't-\""]
["16:55,140","16:57,860","\"- If you ever get a gun or anything in this game.\""]
["16:57,860","16:59,700","\"- Look, you have to admit that's scary.\""]
["16:59,700","17:01,060","\"- That's good, that's good iconography.\""]
["17:01,060","17:04,820","\"That's like as iconic as 2001 Space Odyssey.\""]
["17:04,820","17:06,020","\"- It's true.\""]
["17:06,020","17:07,180","\"- You know what would be a good thing?\""]
["17:07,180","17:09,660","\"It's take a bunch of iconic images\""]
["17:09,660","17:10,740","\"from like all the classic movies\""]
["17:10,740","17:12,540","\"and sneak that in there and put it black and white.\""]
["17:12,540","17:13,360","\"Nobody will know.\""]
["17:13,360","17:14,180","\"- Nobody would notice,\""]
["17:14,180","17:18,980","\"Especially if you put a chromatic abrasion on it, a little bit of blur, a little bit of like film noise.\""]
["17:18,980","17:19,980","\"Can somebody do that now?\""]
["17:19,980","17:20,820","\"It would fit right in.\""]

["18:09,060","18:12,380","\"You could ask this guy any of these questions probably.\""]
