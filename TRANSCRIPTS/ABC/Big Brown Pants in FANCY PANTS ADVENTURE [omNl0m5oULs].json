["07:48,740","07:53,460","\"I wonder if he's gonna have a little teardrop because eyes are gonna hurt. Oh, you have to drop this spike on him\""]
["07:53,460","07:56,480","\"That might be what kills him in the end, but\""]

["09:19,300","09:26,380","\"Dude, I I fucking knew of this game's existence and I don't know why I didn't fucking get it\""]
["09:26,380","09:28,380","\"Now I feel like an idiot\""]
["09:28,380","09:33,420","\"I genuinely feel like people probably don't know like the kind of stuff\""]
["09:33,420","09:37,280","\"They probably like oh that fancy pants game that platform parkour game. Yeah, dude\""]
["09:37,280","09:41,420","\"I fucking this wasn't in the first this is definitely an evolution\""]
["09:41,420","09:46,300","\"He called a super fancy pants, and he's like there's more moves. It's like yeah, I would say so\""]
["09:46,300","09:50,260","\"God damn. Yeah, everyone go buy this game. Make this guy\""]
["09:50,260","09:55,540","\"I'm really gonna buy this game spread the word and spam second so make the next Sonic like this\""]
["09:55,540","09:57,620","\"Yeah, you show them this as an example\""]
["09:58,380","10:05,100","\"Because even me as a devotee to the sonic religion can say like this is way better than any fucking recent shit\""]
["10:05,100","10:13,100","\"Even mani yeah, I would actually say this is better than I would I would I haven't even played mani\""]
["10:13,100","10:20,380","\"I was just saying the movement of this mania was good right, but I feel like this understands momentum even more\""]
["10:20,380","10:22,740","\"definitely\""]
["10:22,740","10:27,460","\"Like this is this just has like a good friend say this is the best momentum game I've ever played my life\""]
["10:27,860","10:29,860","\"Honestly, yes\""]
["10:29,860","10:34,140","\"That's fair. That is totally fair. Yeah, listen, baby\""]
["10:34,140","10:41,020","\"What's that ice cream made it through? That's good. So some on our tips by accident look at her. Oh\""]
["10:41,020","10:43,880","\"Wait\""]
["10:43,880","10:49,860","\"We're over capacity and can't send anyone else where I find something to clear out ink was where back there\""]
["10:49,860","10:57,020","\"Where in the area in the town there was like ink shit. Oh, I thought I was supposed to anchor up\""]
["10:57,540","11:01,540","\"I'm sure that's what I would have. Yeah, that's what you're building to.\""]
["11:01,540","11:05,300","\"I'm sure she'll be fucking real horny once you clear out that.\""]
["11:05,300","11:08,260","\"Yeah, she'll be waving a little stickbutt when you come back to like, anchor up.\""]
["11:08,260","11:09,460","\"She freaking better be.\""]
["11:09,460","11:11,460","\"And this is all made in flash?\""]
["11:11,460","11:13,060","\"God damn. It might be.\""]
["11:13,060","11:15,060","\"I mean, it is. It seems like it's...\""]
["11:15,060","11:17,620","\"I mean, I could be off base here,\""]
["11:17,620","11:19,300","\"but from what I remember,\""]
["11:19,300","11:23,060","\"it seems like it moves the exact same way as the original does, so...\""]
["11:23,060","11:23,940","\"It does, but it...\""]
["11:23,940","11:25,060","\"It probably used the original as a base.\""]
["11:25,060","11:26,580","\"I feel like it doesn't even better, though.\""]
["11:26,580","11:29,760","\"Like it's even more clean like castle crashes is flash, right?\""]
["11:29,760","11:36,080","\"Yeah, but again, castle crashes is like nothing in like like data like it's like it reuses\""]
["11:36,080","11:40,040","\"It's like uses a simple symbol and then they just swap the head out with the different bodies\""]
["11:40,040","11:45,640","\"Like there's probably maybe 30 animations in the whole game and they just swap the the heads out for a lot of them\""]
["11:45,640","11:48,960","\"Like if you look at the enemies you can play as a lot of the enemy characters\""]
["11:48,960","11:52,320","\"Yeah, it was it was brilliant in that regard, but like oh wait a sec\""]
["11:53,040","11:57,240","\"Nightmare cops is like the same thing, but not it's like imagine one character\""]
["11:57,240","12:04,880","\"But that's like half of the animations in a single character for our game and it's like every every enemy is like a thousand frames\""]
["12:04,880","12:07,800","\"It's like fucking insane wait since you animated\""]
["12:07,800","12:13,400","\"Nightmare cops yeah for like did you have to do like 60 frame per second?\""]
["12:13,400","12:19,920","\"Animation did you not I've been animating in 60 frames per second for the last seven years that's really yeah?\""]
["12:20,640","12:25,520","\"I'm like sorry before I used to work in three way to where to God\""]
["12:25,520","12:31,280","\"Yeah, but Chris before used to work in three's and two is when I do animation now. I work in like 14s and 7s\""]
["12:31,280","12:36,600","\"I could 14 is basically like three frames and like sevens is like two\""]
["12:36,600","12:43,320","\"That sounds like insanity, but I'm so used to doing it. I literally animate everything in 60 FPS as if it was 60 FPS\""]
["12:43,320","12:49,600","\"So when the game goes in 60 F. It's even faster. So the animations look more clean\""]
["12:49,600","12:55,040","\"Wow, it's crazy. I wonder if he did it. I wonder if he did this that's true. Yeah, you know\""]
["12:55,040","12:59,000","\"Super smooth, but I don't know if they're like I don't know if it's true\""]
["12:59,000","13:03,560","\"But somebody could probably break the game apart. I feel like all these animations are on like sevens\""]
["13:03,560","13:07,520","\"And it's 60 FPS like it might even be less because of all the frames\""]
["13:07,520","13:10,400","\"So it might be like for 30s maybe\""]
["13:10,400","13:15,200","\"For like the camera movement and stuff might no, I think the game runs at 60\""]
["13:15,200","13:19,320","\"But the animations are at 30 really well. Oh you get these back\""]
["13:19,320","13:26,140","\"What is this again? Can you blast him in the face now? I don't know. Why are you fighting him Chris?\""]

["14:10,220","14:17,360","\"But yeah, Chris I animate on sevens and 14s and like that's what everyone does like we all animate in 60 FPS\""]
["14:17,360","14:23,040","\"That's what you said you animate at 60 and I was like that's insanity. Oh, yeah\""]
["14:23,040","14:29,160","\"That's not like so bad. I thought you were like animating on ones\""]
["14:29,160","14:37,000","\"What no, I would fucking suck impossible. Oh, oh, I see I'm sure some crazy persons done it\""]
["14:37,000","14:42,040","\"Boomer baby make boom boom, baby make big mistake\""]

["15:27,320","15:33,680","\"Because it looks very satisfying this to me is when I watch someone play trials evolution\""]
