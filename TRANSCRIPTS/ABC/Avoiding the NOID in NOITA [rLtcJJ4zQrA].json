["06:30,240","06:35,800","\"Wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, we were talking about I was talking about how like\""]
["06:35,800","06:40,520","\"in Disneyland like if you're in one of the suits\""]
["06:40,520","06:44,560","\"And you start having like a heart attack or something\""]
["06:44,560","06:48,800","\"You're not allowed under any circumstance to take the head off the suit\""]
["06:48,800","06:52,880","\"So even if you're literally dying you have to get out of sight before you\""]
["06:52,880","06:58,540","\"Like remove the head like if you throw up in your suit or if like nerve gas\""]
["06:58,540","07:06,880","\"Traumatized is definitely more important than your very life. Yeah. I love that Disney is the like the wokest shit ever\""]

["07:32,080","07:37,920","\"Nobody dies in Disneyland and to clarify people die in Disneyland all the time\""]
["07:37,920","07:45,620","\"But nobody is legally pronounced dead in Disneyland like there was a guy who uh he was dressed as Pluto\""]
["07:45,620","07:53,180","\"And one of the one of the floats ran over him during the parade and they like took his mangled corpse out of the park and then pronounced him dead\""]
["07:53,180","07:59,740","\"Because they take your corpse out of the park and then they pronounce you dead you don't you don't get pronounced dead in Disneyland\""]
["07:59,740","08:03,220","\"Cause of death\""]
["08:03,220","08:05,860","\"Maleficence evil magic\""]

["19:38,600","19:44,480","\"Even if you just dump a bunch of water unlike little puddles of poison and stuff, it'll eventually just all turn into water\""]
["19:44,480","19:48,620","\"This eats through walls, though. That's kind of cool. Is there a vomit staff?\""]
["19:48,620","19:54,800","\"No, look it you released its spirit and there's rats robots don't\""]
