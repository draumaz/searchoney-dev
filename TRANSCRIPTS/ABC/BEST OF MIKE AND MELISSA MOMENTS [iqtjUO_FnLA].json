["00:02,580","00:06,080","\"- Julian, you should tie this rubber chicken to your belt\""]
["00:06,080","00:08,000","\"and just walk around with a tie to you all the time.\""]
["00:08,000","00:10,120","\"- That would, like a spurger would do.\""]
["00:10,120","00:10,960","\"- Yeah, exactly.\""]
["00:10,960","00:14,040","\"- You could be like the Melissa and Mike guy.\""]
["00:14,040","00:15,400","\"- Oh my gosh. - Where are you wears the t-shirt?\""]
["00:15,400","00:17,640","\"- He does have it, doesn't he wear a tail?\""]
["00:17,640","00:19,560","\"- No, it's like his hat has hair as well.\""]
["00:19,560","00:20,880","\"- He wears the hat and he wears the t-shirt.\""]
["00:20,880","00:21,800","\"- His hat has ears on it.\""]
["00:21,800","00:24,080","\"- I am Mike, the hired core, and awesome.\""]
["00:24,080","00:27,320","\"- We recently showed Chris, Mike, and Melissa.\""]
["00:27,320","00:28,400","\"- It's really good.\""]
["00:28,400","00:30,520","\"And uh, I liked it.\""]
["00:30,520","00:31,120","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:31,120","00:32,360","\"It's a good show.\""]
["00:32,360","00:35,240","\"An entire classroom had to watch it.\""]
["00:35,240","00:37,880","\"It's great.\""]
["00:37,880","00:39,480","\"I like the part where he hates.\""]
["00:39,480","00:40,360","\"He says so much.\""]
["00:40,360","00:42,360","\"He hates composition in the video.\""]
["00:42,360","00:44,520","\"That's 20 minutes long with awful composition.\""]
["00:44,520","00:46,720","\"Chris.\""]
["00:46,720","00:51,480","\"Are you saying that there's a reason he may not like it?\""]
["00:51,480","00:52,720","\"I think there's a raisin way.\""]
["00:52,720","00:54,480","\"He may not like what's the raisin.\""]
["00:54,480","00:57,960","\"His principal hand him a raisin said, that's all you've got.\""]
["00:57,960","00:59,960","\"for putting his own little effort.\""]
["00:59,960","01:01,960","\"And he said, \"\"Ooh!\"\"\""]
["01:01,960","01:03,960","\"He went home and he made that cartoon.\""]
["01:03,960","01:06,960","\"That's actually, that's pretty close to how he screams in it.\""]
["01:06,960","01:08,960","\"You're like, \"\"Eww!\"\"\""]
["01:08,960","01:09,960","\"Oh yeah!\""]
["01:09,960","01:10,960","\"He does.\""]
["01:10,960","01:12,960","\"He says, \"\"This is not metal.\"\"\""]
["01:12,960","01:14,960","\"This is not metal!\""]
["01:14,960","01:17,960","\"He's trying not to be loud while he screams, so it's not--\""]
["01:17,960","01:18,960","\"Oh!\""]
["01:18,960","01:21,960","\"We watched Mike and Melissa again last night.\""]
["01:21,960","01:23,960","\"Did we talk about Mike and Melissa on this show?\""]
["01:23,960","01:24,960","\"What's wrong with you?\""]
["01:24,960","01:26,960","\"We watched it twice on the couch in a row.\""]
["01:26,960","01:29,540","\"- No, listen, he put it on, that made--\""]
["01:29,540","01:30,860","\"- No, no, no, no.\""]
["01:30,860","01:32,040","\"- It wasn't even in a row.\""]
["01:32,040","01:32,880","\"- When was it?\""]
["01:32,880","01:34,240","\"- A half hour pass and you were like,\""]
["01:34,240","01:35,620","\"I wanna watch it again.\""]
["01:35,620","01:37,600","\"But, and we both agreed with you.\""]
["01:37,600","01:39,540","\"- Well, that's what happened was that Julian put it on.\""]
["01:39,540","01:40,720","\"He just wanted to watch it,\""]
["01:40,720","01:43,620","\"and then after we watched it, we watched it again.\""]
["01:43,620","01:44,460","\"- Do we?\""]
["01:44,460","01:45,540","\"- I don't know what it is.\""]
["01:45,540","01:46,380","\"- It is weird.\""]
["01:46,380","01:48,060","\"- Why does Mike and Melissa make you wanna watch it over?\""]
["01:48,060","01:50,240","\"- I'm sad that people went and made fun of him\""]
["01:50,240","01:52,880","\"because it meant that he was never gonna make anything again.\""]
["01:52,880","01:55,560","\"- People, people, I wanna see more.\""]
["01:55,560","02:00,880","\"to give people context uh... there is a guy and he made a very embarrassing\""]
["02:00,880","02:02,400","\"cartoon about\""]
["02:02,400","02:07,400","\"uh... himself and how crazy he is and how it's under study is really cool that\""]
["02:07,400","02:10,800","\"he's kind of you he's cracked and crazy and condensative and more\""]
["02:10,800","02:12,920","\"and he's making a cartoon about\""]
["02:12,920","02:16,320","\"have one of the rest of sex with a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a\""]
["02:16,320","02:18,200","\"is like ex-girlfriend and like\""]
["02:18,200","02:22,200","\"well we were talking about mike and Melissa\""]
["02:22,200","02:23,280","\"- I'm sorry, you gotta have track, you know.\""]
["02:23,280","02:24,320","\"- Yeah, sorry.\""]
["02:24,320","02:26,360","\"So, I'll break it down really quick, right?\""]
["02:26,360","02:29,120","\"(dramatic music)\""]
["02:29,120","02:42,560","\"Starts off, so you see this guy,\""]
["02:42,560","02:44,200","\"he's wearing a furry hat to begin with.\""]
["02:44,200","02:46,240","\"He's drawn himself like a really weird--\""]
["02:46,240","02:48,560","\"- He's a really buff, he's drawn himself really buff.\""]
["02:48,560","02:49,640","\"- Okay, okay.\""]
["02:49,640","02:52,000","\"So there's Guy Komike, he's staring in the mirror,\""]
["02:52,000","02:54,600","\"He's talking about how crazy and misunderstood he is.\""]
["02:54,600","02:56,720","\"Then he starts howling for no reason.\""]
["02:56,720","02:59,720","\"Then other people in his house start shouting at him to stop.\""]
["02:59,720","03:00,880","\"And then he walks out.\""]
["03:00,880","03:04,680","\"Then he starts like, it shows a montage of him sitting around the house.\""]
["03:04,680","03:07,640","\"There's really creepy weird mid-eye music playing in the background that he made.\""]
["03:07,640","03:09,240","\"- Because he doesn't know how to compose.\""]
["03:09,240","03:12,840","\"- He was trying to do like an Animaniacs thing where just like clarinets and shit going like,\""]
["03:12,840","03:15,580","\"*mumbling*\""]
["03:15,580","03:18,180","\"But he has no musical theory, so it's just\""]
["03:18,180","03:21,020","\"*mumbling*\""]
["03:21,020","03:22,120","\"Yeah, basically.\""]
["03:22,120","03:23,560","\"That's his title card, Chris.\""]
["03:23,560","03:24,560","\"No, that's...\""]
["03:24,560","03:26,960","\"*mumbling*\""]
["03:26,960","03:31,900","\"There's a montage of him doing things, and he keeps getting angrier and angrier at everything he's doing.\""]
["03:31,900","03:33,160","\"And then...\""]
["03:33,160","03:37,320","\"Is it supposed to be relatable, or is it supposed to be him being self-deprecating?\""]
["03:37,320","03:38,780","\"I think it's supposed to be like...\""]
["03:38,780","03:41,280","\"No one understands me, no one gets me.\""]
["03:41,280","03:48,280","\"Ooh, but like he draws himself really really buff and then it cuts to him in college in the back of a classroom\""]
["03:48,280","03:52,880","\"Oh, you're right, that's a mic the hired quaran awesome\""]
["03:52,880","03:56,080","\"He's wearing his own shirt. This is I am Mike the hard core and awesome\""]
["03:56,080","03:58,560","\"There's a girl with her titties.\""]
["03:58,560","04:02,240","\"To clarify this was not a teenager. This was like a guy in college\""]
["04:02,240","04:08,200","\"Who is an animation student who made this as his thesis apparently but then it cuts to a mad side\""]
["04:08,200","04:12,480","\"There's a girl outside and her titties are being pushed down super hard by her back strap\""]
["04:12,480","04:18,640","\"She has a really wide stance for some reason and he and he starts thinking about how she doesn't like him\""]
["04:18,640","04:23,680","\"And he doesn't even try to communicate with her and he gets angry at her and then it cuts to him in in school\""]
["04:23,680","04:26,840","\"He's sitting at the back and this is a composition class\""]
["04:26,840","04:34,280","\"He's in for art and the teacher is literally saying this rectangle this rectangle is boring and stupid this rectangle\""]
["04:34,600","04:39,420","\"And he's just a he's pretty much making this rectangles most fucking amazing thing in the world\""]
["04:39,420","04:45,680","\"He's making fun of his composition teacher for teaching him composition even though every shot in this cartoon is is awful\""]
["04:45,680","04:49,920","\"Yes, horrible and then somebody could be teaching him something, but he's not having it\""]
["04:49,920","04:54,240","\"Then it cuts to him at a college party that he brings all of his rock and roll metal friends\""]
["04:54,240","04:55,880","\"And I'm not sure who invited him anyways\""]
["04:55,880","05:00,700","\"Like he just kind of shows up at a party randomly right after and no one wants to be there\""]
["05:01,080","05:05,460","\"Which is like why are you there then why did you go to the party but no wait\""]
["05:05,460","05:09,120","\"Sorry, did this scene starts with really weird music music that's going\""]
["05:09,120","05:14,560","\"It cuts to an iPod it's called an ice\""]
["05:14,560","05:21,520","\"Cuz the ice slave the music is called generic happy music by the Lamingtons and then\""]
["05:21,520","05:26,920","\"Then he starts ordering beer and he starts getting angry at everyone for not wanting to listen\""]
["05:26,920","05:30,080","\"No, no, you forgot about Lenny and Choo-choo. Oh, yes\""]
["05:30,080","05:34,320","\"Do two random characters show the reason I forgot about them is because they don't say anything\""]
["05:34,320","05:37,220","\"They'll say anything that makes any sense they show up and they go\""]
["05:37,220","05:44,800","\"And I start repeating weird sound mr. Mike is trying to make fun of people\""]
["05:44,800","05:49,040","\"But he's not actually making fun of them for something specific. He's just calling them stupid and dumb\""]
["05:49,040","05:53,720","\"It's it's weird though. This whole party scene seems like it's based off an event that happened\""]
["05:53,720","05:57,100","\"Yeah, but then his retelling of it doesn't make any sense whatsoever\""]
["05:57,440","06:04,000","\"He starts drinking beer and he sings the beer song. Oh, yeah, and that's the closest thing to a song and the whole thing goes beer\""]
["06:04,000","06:06,960","\"goop-sp-sp-ear\""]
["06:06,960","06:08,760","\"goop-goop-goop\""]
["06:08,760","06:11,760","\"You don't have to do the whole thing Chris, but then he uh\""]
["06:11,760","06:16,160","\"He grows slightly larger as he's reclining on the couch with this girl\""]
["06:16,160","06:17,840","\"uh\""]
["06:17,840","06:18,840","\"It does!\""]
["06:18,840","06:21,960","\"His one eye shaking as he he's talking about\""]
["06:21,960","06:24,660","\"I don't even have fucking guard on do I?\""]
["06:24,660","06:31,460","\"His like web comic series or whatever with her and she goes that's cool that's cool and she gets up and leaves\""]
["06:31,460","06:34,300","\"But anyway\""]
["06:34,300","06:39,720","\"The more the cartoon goes on the more it shows that he hates everything around him everyone is stupid not him\""]
["06:39,720","06:44,420","\"Well, you gotta you gotta conclude the party scene. Oh, yeah, they see the band\""]
["06:44,420","06:48,480","\"They watch some indie band who's obviously an indie banks their music is like\""]
["06:48,820","06:55,820","\"Buh-buh-buh. Like there's a guy with a two, but he's okay. Am I gonna die am and the guy goes stroke my face\""]
["06:55,820","06:58,800","\"Please don't leave me\""]
["06:58,800","07:03,940","\"And he's just like doing this weird voice and then his friends get mad that the music isn't metal\""]
["07:03,940","07:06,820","\"So they all stormed the party and started kicking the shit out of everything\""]
["07:06,820","07:14,900","\"They mess with the stop sign he he pees on a tree and I I he walks over goes don't pee on that tree asshole\""]
["07:14,900","07:17,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:17,100","07:19,760","\"- I just wanted to talk about my sandwich!\""]
["07:19,760","07:21,920","\"- Okay, you're just summarizing, I guess, you know what?\""]
["07:21,920","07:23,320","\"If we're gonna talk about the details,\""]
["07:23,320","07:26,440","\"I should mention that he's embarrassed to himself\""]
["07:26,440","07:27,560","\"about masturbating.\""]
["07:27,560","07:28,400","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:28,400","07:30,080","\"- Like he-- - Let's get this over with.\""]
["07:30,080","07:30,920","\"- Let's get this over with,\""]
["07:30,920","07:32,240","\"as if he doesn't wanna do it.\""]
["07:32,240","07:33,080","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:33,080","07:34,520","\"- Like he's being forced into it.\""]
["07:34,520","07:36,680","\"- But then the whole point of the cartoon\""]
["07:36,680","07:40,240","\"is now is when he starts hallucinating a pink\""]
["07:40,240","07:44,520","\"or a purple skunk girl who's now his imaginary girlfriend\""]
["07:44,520","07:49,740","\"And they start talking about how even though he's crazy, it's okay because he's having fun with it.\""]
["07:49,740","07:55,700","\"And then they start like walking around together and he's blushing and he's embarrassed, but he loves her so much.\""]
["07:55,700","07:58,020","\"And then it kind of cuts off and nothing happens.\""]
["07:58,020","08:04,080","\"Uh, yeah, that's pretty much the rest of it is just him justifying to himself why it's okay to be crazy.\""]
["08:04,080","08:10,780","\"But we just summarized the whole thing, but you should go watch it just to see the little details that you will not understand for the life of you.\""]
["08:10,780","08:13,460","\"I think it's really interesting.\""]
["08:13,460","08:15,620","\"- Especially the more you watch it.\""]
["08:15,620","08:16,460","\"- The more you watch it.\""]
["08:16,460","08:17,820","\"- The ending is really compelling\""]
["08:17,820","08:21,500","\"because you're having somebody who clearly is not there at all.\""]
["08:21,500","08:23,140","\"- He's creating an echo chamber for himself\""]
["08:23,140","08:25,220","\"so it doesn't have to feel bad about being here.\""]
["08:25,220","08:26,660","\"- Yeah, it's interesting.\""]
["08:26,660","08:29,780","\"It's like kind of watching Garth Merengi, for example,\""]
["08:29,780","08:32,580","\"but it's a story being told by someone\""]
["08:32,580","08:35,700","\"kind of portraying himself as the hero\""]
["08:35,700","08:37,940","\"because the world around him frustrates him\""]
["08:37,940","08:39,220","\"and he doesn't have a place there\""]
["08:39,220","08:41,420","\"because of his own like fault.\""]
["08:41,420","08:42,260","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:42,260","08:44,260","\"you watch it the more little details you pick up on.\""]
["08:44,260","08:50,460","\"Yeah, it's uh, it is too bad people made fun of him because I wish he just kind of got\""]
["08:50,460","08:51,460","\"to go on.\""]
["08:51,460","08:52,460","\"I want it.\""]
["08:52,460","08:56,940","\"He opens it up with a little intro that says like naked animals production or something\""]
["08:56,940","08:57,940","\"like that.\""]
["08:57,940","09:00,860","\"When people do stuff like this I don't want them to stop.\""]
["09:00,860","09:03,180","\"I don't want people to stop when they do this stuff.\""]
["09:03,180","09:07,820","\"People always go in and like attack them and try to make them like want to give up.\""]
["09:07,820","09:08,820","\"Let them do it.\""]
["09:08,820","09:12,100","\"Like if you're being entertained by it, what's the problem?\""]
["09:12,100","09:19,100","\"can enjoy it then.\""]
["09:19,100","09:23,100","\"I will say what I will say what I will say is.\""]
["09:23,100","09:24,100","\"What I think this was leaked by his classmates.\""]
["09:24,100","09:25,100","\"Was it?\""]
["09:25,100","09:26,100","\"Multiple people.\""]
["09:26,100","09:33,100","\"I will say I forgot that he actually drops his ex's name and beeps it.\""]
["09:33,100","09:34,100","\"That's pretty shitty.\""]
["09:34,100","09:36,100","\"I can't really justify that at all.\""]
["09:36,100","09:38,100","\"He's clearly a rotten guy.\""]
["09:38,100","09:39,100","\"Wait.\""]
["09:39,100","09:41,100","\"His classmates leaked it.\""]
["09:41,100","09:46,100","\"He never did not post it, but he had posted it to a YouTube and they pointed out his YouTube.\""]
["09:46,100","09:49,100","\"Are you fucking serious?\""]
["09:49,100","09:50,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:50,100","09:52,100","\"So he clearly had made enemies, I think.\""]
["09:52,100","09:53,100","\"It sounds like it.\""]
["09:53,100","09:54,100","\"It's an interesting story.\""]
["09:54,100","09:56,100","\"It is.\""]
["09:56,100","09:58,100","\"Like he learned from...\""]
["09:58,100","10:01,100","\"Like if you're ever out there, please continue the story.\""]
["10:01,100","10:04,100","\"We hope you've become a better person since you're...\""]
["10:04,100","10:06,100","\"I'm sure he was like 60 ago.\""]
