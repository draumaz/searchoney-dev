["00:08,200","00:12,440","\"if you got in a fight with a guy, and then he just did a back flip.\""]
["00:12,440","00:17,240","\"Like, before you got to fighting him, you thought you could take him, and then he did a back flip.\""]
["00:17,240","00:18,640","\"Would you, like, back off?\""]
["00:18,640","00:21,040","\"Ah, back off, yeah.\""]
["00:21,040","00:21,760","\"I don't know.\""]
["00:21,760","00:28,080","\"If I was close enough to him when he did the back flip, I think I'd try to, like, trip him up and ruin his back flip.\""]

["23:18,780","23:20,780","\"repariting so other places\""]
["23:20,780","23:29,060","\"But I just found half of a CD so I don't care about no nobody oh wait you yeah, you already had the other half of that one yeah\""]
