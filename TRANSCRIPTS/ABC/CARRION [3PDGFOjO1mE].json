["01:18,120","01:18,960","\"- Are you too soft?\""]

["02:09,320","02:15,120","\"Oh my god. Oh, yeah fresh flesh of prey. Can I eat his bum bum?\""]
["02:15,120","02:21,420","\"It says it says release right stick to pull them towards you and consume them. Oh, okay, so let's see\""]
["02:22,200","02:27,020","\"Well, I think that's just legs. Oh, you could eat the legs though. Well, green parts came out there and\""]
["02:27,020","02:33,840","\"You are you a bigger son. They look bigger. You look that little green thing is filling up\""]
["02:33,840","02:39,400","\"We eat a part of someone I think oh, so maybe you get bigger and smaller depending on how much health you have\""]
["02:39,400","02:42,400","\"Could be give me these\""]
["02:42,400","02:46,360","\"God I'm so gross. What the fuck am I told more?\""]
["02:46,360","02:49,440","\"You're the fucking thing\""]

["02:54,240","02:58,640","\"Fucking say oh my god\""]
["02:58,640","03:04,920","\"I'm sure it will be quite as but what's guys start shooting back, but\""]
["03:04,920","03:14,520","\"Wait, so consume them all I'm still kind of figuring out. Let's so that grabs. Oh, do I have to drag them towards my mouth?\""]
["03:14,520","03:18,000","\"Yeah, and then release I see oh\""]
["03:19,080","03:25,900","\"Okay, I'm a big man. Look at that. Oh, you got all five things. What does that mean? This is mean maximum size?\""]
["03:25,900","03:28,800","\"I guess got I'm so gross\""]
["03:28,800","03:32,720","\"You're so stringy. What a nasty little man\""]
["03:32,720","03:39,120","\"Can I go up? Oh, you can squeeze in I think I missed something over here. Let's see real quick\""]
["03:39,120","03:42,600","\"Okay, I guess I didn't miss shit\""]
["03:42,600","03:46,720","\"No, okay, you can stick to the ceilings\""]
["03:47,440","03:53,520","\"Yeah, okay. That's how you hunt. Are you poor out of me? Yeah, why's it called carry on?\""]
["03:53,520","04:00,680","\"It's carrion's just a word for like an animal carcass really I think so I didn't know that\""]
["04:00,680","04:08,760","\"So this is that what you are like a carcass I mean you turn things into carcasses. That's true\""]
["04:08,760","04:13,520","\"Oh, oh you open something in the other room asking the hard-hitting questions here\""]
["04:16,080","04:20,000","\"All right, what is the actual definition of carry-in in the dictionary?\""]
["04:20,000","04:26,720","\"Please look it up, please. I will fucking absolutely scream if I don't know the word-for-word\""]
["04:26,720","04:30,720","\"definition is defined by some dip shit now, Benny\""]
["04:30,720","04:33,880","\"Yeah, maybe I won't look\""]
["04:33,880","04:38,900","\"Spread biomass and save this is a save point\""]
["04:38,900","04:44,240","\"The decaying yeah, carrying is the decaying flesh of dead animals. Whoa look at that\""]
["04:44,240","04:50,740","\"Whoa, so that becomes holy shit dude. You're horrifying. Are you opening like portals to the void?\""]
["04:50,740","04:53,240","\"Yeah, what the fuck squeeze into the void? Okay?\""]
["04:53,240","04:55,900","\"Okay, here we go\""]
["04:55,900","05:02,840","\"It's alive wait. Did you just go to your home dimension? Oh, no, you're just leaving that was just a regular door\""]
["05:02,840","05:07,140","\"It looked like an ed tea. I'll water to eat wallpaper\""]
["05:07,140","05:14,120","\"See look it's got a little little alveoli things in it. Yeah, I think you put that\""]
["05:14,120","05:19,800","\"there though. Oh I see. Is this just a... You're fucking evil. It's just a billboard.\""]
["05:19,800","05:23,800","\"Okay so I can go left. What's over here to the right?\""]
["05:23,800","05:29,320","\"Oh holy fuck. I like how you're shaped like a big like weird hot dog.\""]
["05:29,320","05:35,720","\"The fuck is that? That's your ultimate form. The hot dog? Oh. I guess it's probably supposed to\""]
["05:35,720","05:41,240","\"look like a centipede or something. Ooh. You can rip those off. Oh I can't go back out that way.\""]
["05:42,920","05:55,720","\"You're committed. Oh spinning my favorite. What's down here? Can I get down there? Be careful if you try to go down there. What if that thing slices you up?\""]
["05:55,720","06:11,920","\"I don't think I can go down there. This is easily the most relatable character in video games. I do think about doing this stuff quite a bit. There you go. There's another lever to pull. You know me tell me I love weavos. Come on. Fucking.\""]
["06:11,920","06:17,080","\"You know there we go grabbing stuff can be kind of tricky. I wonder is this more of a mouse game\""]
["06:17,080","06:22,800","\"I was just about to say that could be except I was about to I was about to say it and then I was gonna\""]
["06:22,800","06:26,560","\"Say something really cool after it, but then now I don't I don't want to say it anymore\""]
["06:26,560","06:29,160","\"What were you gonna do? No, I was gonna say something do something really cool\""]
["06:29,160","06:34,000","\"But that would that would have been predicated on me being the first person to say that so now I'm not gonna say it fuck\""]
["06:34,000","06:37,520","\"Okay, I'm sorry. I mean to ruin your day. No, you didn't ruin anything in fact\""]
["06:37,520","06:40,400","\"I'm glad you said it first cuz it took the pressure off of me, you know\""]
["06:41,440","06:44,880","\"Thanks, lol. Yeah, you're welcome see how I did that\""]
["06:44,880","06:52,620","\"Caution unprotected yeah, just bleed through can I do this grab grab through it and grab that lever\""]
["06:52,620","06:57,040","\"Oh, yeah, you can grab down at the lever can't you no I can't go that far no\""]
["06:57,040","07:01,380","\"I think you can get your hand through yeah, there you go. What the fuck\""]
["07:01,380","07:06,300","\"- can I you shot your hand through that and it went pretty far\""]
["07:06,300","07:10,080","\"I think you could probably hit that lever if you really really gave it your dang this\""]
["07:10,080","07:15,840","\"I don't think that's gonna happen you just touch the floor. That's it's a grab you tentacles. Oh, okay\""]
["07:15,840","07:21,080","\"That's not the yeah, those are the moving tentacles those aren't the grab you can I see all right?\""]
["07:21,080","07:25,920","\"Never mind you probably can extend your range later or something wait. Can you rip that off to the left though?\""]
["07:25,920","07:28,480","\"Yeah, okay\""]
["07:28,480","07:31,720","\"Hmm I am to be great\""]
["07:35,760","07:39,800","\"Wonder what you're gonna fight. I know right go in that little hole\""]
["07:39,800","07:49,520","\"Oh, it's another save I guess can you travel between the two oh, yeah, it probably gave you a fast travel point\""]
["07:49,520","07:52,960","\"Whoa, oh\""]
["07:52,960","07:59,640","\"This is getting so weird. I say just go with it. What a great fucking idea for a game\""]
["07:59,640","08:03,040","\"It's definitely interesting\""]
["08:04,040","08:07,080","\"It's kind of like you know remember that game inside\""]
["08:07,080","08:12,040","\"Yeah, yeah, when you want to be like that that being that thing was like the coolest part\""]
["08:12,040","08:13,960","\"They're like let's just make a game out of that\""]
["08:13,960","08:18,800","\"Could be this thing does move like fucking nothing else\""]
["08:18,800","08:21,200","\"like whoa\""]
["08:21,200","08:27,360","\"Does it feel like anything to control this thing like is there another game that you can think of that?\""]
["08:27,360","08:29,960","\"like the movement and\""]
["08:29,960","08:32,960","\"Actions feel similar to\""]
["08:33,680","08:35,680","\"Not really I mean it's uh\""]
["08:35,680","08:42,760","\"It looks intuitive all you do is you move the analog stick and he goes all over the place you don't really have to do anything\""]
["08:42,760","08:44,920","\"okay\""]
["08:44,920","08:51,040","\"It's got a bit of a physics you feel to it careful with this guy. He's got an actual gun. Oh my god a gun oh\""]
["08:51,040","08:53,920","\"fuck\""]
["08:53,920","08:56,840","\"Yeah\""]
["08:56,840","08:59,160","\"Give me that\""]
["08:59,160","09:03,700","\"Do you ever feel like sometimes with video games that they are constrained?\""]
["09:03,700","09:07,200","\"sometimes by like reality or by like what we\""]
["09:07,200","09:10,100","\"What we are and know\""]
["09:10,100","09:15,240","\"What kind of a fuck no, okay that sounds really stupid, right?\""]
["09:15,240","09:17,840","\"But no, no, I know exactly what you mean right now\""]
["09:17,840","09:22,160","\"You're controlling a thing that like doesn't resemble a person at all\""]
["09:22,160","09:29,140","\"Yeah, and it looks like the mechanics of this game are totally different from any game where you would be controlling a\""]
["09:29,140","09:35,780","\"person. You know what I mean? Like in a first person shooter game, I feel like a first person\""]
["09:35,780","09:40,420","\"shooter game is always going to have to balance some like shitty fucking sniper rifle weapon,\""]
["09:40,420","09:46,980","\"because those things exist in real life. But like, why would you design a game with that in it?\""]
["09:46,980","09:50,420","\"You know? Yeah, if you just make something completely unique, you don't have to do that.\""]
["09:50,420","09:55,220","\"Are you able to go down that too, but your current size? I think so. I just, there you go.\""]
["09:56,580","10:00,600","\"This fucking thing. Oh, you can't hit me. Oh\""]
["10:00,600","10:05,500","\"Fuck I feel like I'm overpowered like I mean\""]
["10:05,500","10:11,420","\"I think the game wants to start you off that way and they're probably gonna make the enemies tougher and tougher as you go\""]
["10:11,420","10:17,280","\"And I want to eat every little bit, but also it's really hard to aim with an analog stick like this whoa\""]
["10:17,280","10:24,460","\"Give me that let me eat you there we go. I'm gonna try this mouse one sec\""]
["10:24,460","10:25,460","\"Okay.\""]
["10:25,460","10:26,460","\"Ooh.\""]
["10:26,460","10:27,460","\"Okay.\""]
["10:27,460","10:29,020","\"Rip that grate off the ceiling.\""]
["10:29,020","10:30,100","\"Yeah, that one.\""]
["10:30,100","10:33,100","\"Does it feel better with a mouse?\""]
["10:33,100","10:34,100","\"Kind of.\""]
["10:34,100","10:37,300","\"Now, how do you get down through these?\""]
["10:37,300","10:38,500","\"I feel like that's a power up.\""]
["10:38,500","10:39,500","\"I'm going to get-\""]
["10:39,500","10:41,380","\"The probably is power ups that increase your reach.\""]
["10:41,380","10:45,140","\"Yeah, it's probably just going to be both times I've seen that.\""]
["10:45,140","10:46,820","\"There's been a switch on the other side of them.\""]
["10:46,820","10:49,100","\"So I assume that you just need a longer reach.\""]
["10:49,100","10:51,500","\"Let's go down here and rip that off.\""]
["10:51,500","10:54,420","\"Ripping things off doesn't feel as good with the mouse because it's slow.\""]
["10:54,420","11:00,860","\"Okay, but doing that's definitely way easier. Oh\""]
["11:00,860","11:07,840","\"You fucking asshole see the way my little parts slithered away. Yeah, that was cool\""]
["11:07,840","11:11,780","\"That oh\""]
["11:11,780","11:15,260","\"Size yeah, I need to get back\""]
["11:15,260","11:18,740","\"Should I go down there let's see\""]
["11:18,740","11:21,940","\"Mmm-hmm\""]
["11:22,020","11:26,840","\"Spread your bayou man speed by faking by you dude blob monsters\""]
["11:26,840","11:33,020","\"I think you're always like the fucking sickest shit. Have you seen the blob the blob like the movie\""]
["11:33,020","11:36,180","\"I've seen one of them. I know that they've actually ever seen the blob\""]
["11:36,180","11:40,260","\"I've just seen some scenes that you showed me Chris the one from the 80s is really cool\""]
["11:40,260","11:42,780","\"I'm pretty sure that's the one that I've seen\""]
["11:42,780","11:45,420","\"It's like actually scary\""]
["11:45,420","11:50,180","\"Yeah, it's I don't know there's there is something that's like really fucking\""]
["11:51,340","11:57,540","\"Nerving about like a giant amoeba or something like that. Yeah, it doesn't discriminate against you fucking kills\""]
["11:57,540","12:04,180","\"Also, can you do anything with that that resembles the container you were born out of wait\""]
["12:04,180","12:10,900","\"Where was it just like that? Oh, yeah, is that oh, that's it. That's a power-up. I think yeah, break it. Oh shit\""]
["12:10,900","12:13,540","\"What a friend oh?\""]
["12:13,540","12:15,580","\"squeeze in\""]
["12:15,580","12:19,820","\"It's gonna give me a power up there. We go to cobweb to trap your victims\""]
["12:19,820","12:23,660","\"-Oh, you might be able to use that to pull the lever up top there.\""]
["12:23,660","12:25,100","\"-Can't believe I fucking missed that.\""]
["12:25,100","12:25,900","\"-Yes.\""]

["12:30,780","12:37,180","\"-I guess that's what power-ups are going to look like in this game.\""]
["12:37,180","12:43,420","\"-Do you ever see that fucking Ryan Reynolds movie where there's a blob in space and it's strong or something?\""]
["12:43,420","12:44,860","\"-No, what are you talking about?\""]
["12:44,860","12:45,500","\"-Is that life?\""]

["12:45,980","12:46,940","\"-Life?\""]
["12:46,940","12:47,500","\"-Yes.\""]
["12:47,500","12:49,660","\"-I think the game's-- I think that movie's just called life.\""]
["12:49,660","12:52,440","\"- Yeah, they find a blob in space and they're like,\""]
["12:52,440","12:55,980","\"it's a buff blob and then they're scared of it.\""]
["12:55,980","12:57,640","\"(laughs)\""]
["12:57,640","13:00,200","\"- Oh yeah, 'cause it's little, but it's like super strong\""]
["13:00,200","13:03,060","\"and then it keeps growing as it like kills\""]
["13:03,060","13:05,620","\"and absorbs crew members.\""]
["13:05,620","13:06,800","\"- No, it doesn't do that.\""]
["13:06,800","13:07,640","\"I didn't even know that.\""]
["13:07,640","13:09,500","\"- Oh, I honestly don't remember.\""]
["13:09,500","13:10,500","\"- Oh, did you see it?\""]
["13:10,500","13:13,380","\"- Yeah, I've seen at least a good chunk of it while Jack,\""]
["13:13,380","13:15,180","\"I think it was Jacksy watching.\""]
["13:15,180","13:17,420","\"- Are they dead?\""]

["13:19,180","13:26,860","\"just traps him and freaks him out. Oh, there you go. Definitely. Oh, shit. That's cool.\""]
["13:26,860","13:37,020","\"Now their body's just screaming on the ground. Did I cut their head off? No, okay. This is awesome.\""]
["13:37,020","13:46,620","\"Who's screaming, man? This piece of shit. Yum, yum, yum. Oh my God. What happened to this portal?\""]

["13:57,060","14:01,900","\"Yeah, that's they got a lot of nice like convincing screams in this game.\""]
["14:01,900","14:04,500","\"Yeah, that sounds truly horrified.\""]
["14:04,500","14:12,940","\"I feel like a have you noticed that like rampage games have kind of disappeared a little bit?\""]
["14:12,940","14:18,860","\"Oh, yeah, like there used to be like a lot of open world games where you could just like kill NPCs\""]
["14:18,860","14:23,460","\"Even if that wasn't the purpose of the game like hulko ultimate rampage\""]
["14:23,460","14:30,700","\"I think a lot of that is thanks to like fucking people getting pissed off about it and saying it like influences kids to kill shit\""]
["14:30,700","14:38,140","\"When they have the option to just kill shit, I guess but like I don't know it's like all we've got now is like rock star stuff\""]
["14:38,420","14:43,120","\"Yeah, I'm not even saying like GTA clones specifically\""]
["14:43,120","14:47,980","\"I'm just saying there were a lot of games where like like a sassons creed is not necessarily about\""]
["14:47,980","14:53,820","\"Murdering people on the street, but the first few assassins creed you you could just fucking kill people\""]
["14:53,820","14:57,580","\"That was just something you could fuck around with and now it's like\""]
["14:57,580","15:06,500","\"The last one I played was the pirate one and you you fucking you straight up cannot murder people as a pirate\""]
["15:07,100","15:14,680","\"Wait, what does that say about echo locate nearby nearby hive crevices? Oh, that's what that is. Yes, as if you hit left chiff. Oh\""]

["15:20,960","15:30,640","\"It will probably unlock that door finally my point is now I feel like killing games like they're games like this or\""]
["15:30,640","15:34,580","\"Or like man eaters one that I played recently where you're just a shark\""]
["15:34,980","15:40,880","\"Is that fun by the way? I was thinking about getting it during their summer sale if you see it for really cheap\""]
["15:40,880","15:46,160","\"It's it's like if you pay like maybe like 10 or 15 bucks or something for it's probably worth it\""]
["15:46,160","15:52,080","\"Okay, it's one of those games where you're definitely bored of it by the time it's over, but it was fun\""]
["15:52,080","15:58,680","\"It seems like a game like that can only have so much depth of play. Yeah, but it was it was fun\""]
["15:58,680","16:03,720","\"Here Lyle, would you like to try this with the controller of the mouse? Sure. I'll give it a shot with the controller\""]
