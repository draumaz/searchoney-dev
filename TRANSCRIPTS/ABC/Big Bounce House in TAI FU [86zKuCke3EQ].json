["02:44,660","02:52,900","\"And people were like but people were mad that like like it it almost seemed like they didn't know that it wasn't a real animal\""]
["02:53,700","02:59,540","\"It was really fucking strange. They're telling that story when we went to do it or not Disneyland universal studios as a kid\""]

["03:07,780","03:11,340","\"Let me alone. I don't like that\""]
["03:11,340","03:17,220","\"But yeah, so we all went to universal studios and there was an attraction at the time where they had a big animatronic\""]
["03:17,380","03:22,380","\"Try start tops just standing in a room and you'd walk in and they'd have a person standing next to it\""]
["03:22,380","03:24,980","\"And they'd be like they'd be like oh, yeah, this is Sally\""]
["03:24,980","03:27,660","\"She's one of our oldest try start tops here in Jurassic Park\""]
["03:27,660","03:30,460","\"And they're like role-playing that's alive and that was the point\""]
["03:30,460","03:35,940","\"But all the kids just kept asking like yeah, but what power is it like like they just wouldn't stop\""]
["03:35,940","03:38,820","\"They just kept saying stuff like yeah, but where's the wires?\""]
["03:38,820","03:44,800","\"Yeah, but like does it break yeah, and like and then the people were just getting super frustrated be like well\""]

["03:57,300","04:00,100","\"They were just literally being kids being like yeah, but how where does the way like that?\""]
["04:00,100","04:06,740","\"They weren't stupid the kid was just curious I see in his head. Maybe he just was it just one kid doing this?\""]
["04:06,740","04:10,140","\"No, it's like - okay, let me up. Okay. I got it\""]
["04:10,860","04:15,700","\"It's like people that like I don't know if it's like interact with wrestlers and tell them wrestling isn't real\""]
["04:15,700","04:23,460","\"Yeah, but you remember being a kid and like your parents will bring you to Disneyland or like take you see Santa and in your head\""]
["04:23,460","04:25,460","\"You're like I know he's not real\""]
["04:25,460","04:31,100","\"But everyone's acting like he is you're like I'm not stupid. I guess yeah, I think that's just how the kid was\""]
["04:31,100","04:37,340","\"I hear that if you tell them all Santa that he's not real. He's contractually obligated to fade into non-existence\""]
["04:38,340","04:40,340","\"Starts crumbling away. Yeah\""]
["04:40,340","04:49,580","\"And then fucking like yeah phase out of reality they have to do like an unbreakable vow before he goes in\""]
["04:49,580","04:57,460","\"Yeah, he's got a contract and an unbreakable vow that he has to sign if you make it so that the kids think you're not real\""]
["04:57,460","04:59,940","\"Make God mercy on yourself. Oh\""]
["04:59,940","05:03,940","\"Fuck these guys. I don't need them come here\""]
["05:04,540","05:10,980","\"You also started fighting like cheetah fellers. Yeah leopards this game should have been probably like half as long\""]

["05:19,800","05:23,140","\"I mean we you're also playing this like fucking\""]
["05:23,140","05:29,940","\"20 years later. Yeah when this this kind of like novel game concept was not anything special\""]
["05:29,940","05:34,300","\"Yeah, good beer. Oh, you fucking idiot. Oh, there he goes\""]
["05:34,300","05:36,300","\"To hell with him. What is this?\""]

["06:14,440","06:18,900","\"You could just I think you can just ditch them here. That's fucking cool\""]
["06:18,900","06:24,300","\"I do kind of like sometimes when games like encourage you to just run away from shit\""]
["06:24,300","06:29,800","\"Like there's a lot of points in Dark Souls where it's just like you can fight through this\""]
["06:29,800","06:32,700","\"But really you kind of got to like get the fuck out\""]
["06:32,700","06:36,760","\"Yeah, I'll always try to fight through everything the first time I encounter it\""]
