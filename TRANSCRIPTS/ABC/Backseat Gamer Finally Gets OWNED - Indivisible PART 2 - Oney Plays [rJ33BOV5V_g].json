["12:13,780","12:16,980","\"It just told you could so new one left it just now\""]
["12:16,980","12:19,800","\"Yeah\""]

["12:48,200","12:58,800","\"Okay, I guess you might have oh my god, I guess that heals people. I thought you left your special move\""]
["12:58,800","13:03,840","\"Chris dude, you're like dying. No, dude. It's not it's not as easy as I thought\""]
["13:07,120","13:12,220","\"How to we didn't let your healer heal your friends Chris. Oh, no, she's thinking about it\""]
["13:12,220","13:21,660","\"I don't care anymore. I hate that that's how it like warps you back. It's so lazy right there\""]
["13:21,660","13:24,000","\"You don't do all that shit again\""]
["13:24,000","13:28,280","\"Cory look she's the big shit\""]
["13:28,280","13:31,560","\"Well, at least you gave her a privacy\""]
["13:32,840","13:37,760","\"They're I need to go pee real quick. I like her thing in her hat. It's cute. Yeah, it's a good design\""]
["13:37,760","13:43,200","\"Let's eat it. I'm positive. That's what it does. Let's make a bomb you sandwich it with that fucker\""]
["13:43,200","13:46,400","\"I'll be down\""]
["13:46,400","13:52,400","\"Why\""]
["13:52,400","13:56,440","\"I thought that was her hair at first\""]
["13:56,440","14:00,680","\"And it's not okay. I'm back. What's what the hell's this nerd?\""]
["14:00,680","14:05,500","\"I don't know another party member. Yeah, Dave just took three steps to botanist\""]
["14:05,500","14:08,800","\"She's your party\""]
["14:08,800","14:10,800","\"Your daughter Chris\""]
["14:10,800","14:17,760","\"I think that was my daughter so much boiling water would be wasted on her skull\""]
["14:17,760","14:26,520","\"But no course before I left I get what you're saying\""]
["14:26,520","14:31,440","\"It's weird that some main characters aren't like doing voice acting and it makes you feel like they're back characters\""]
["14:31,440","14:33,440","\"So you don't really pay attention. Yeah\""]
["14:33,440","14:36,040","\"That they join your party. Yeah, this one this one has dialogue\""]
["14:36,040","14:36,920","\"Yeah\""]
["14:36,920","14:42,080","\"But like the person who like introduces an important mechanic about like soul stones doesn't hmm\""]
["14:42,080","14:45,960","\"She wants us to find a couple resurrection lilies. Okay, so they're probably down here\""]
["14:45,960","14:49,800","\"So don't look at Laura\""]
["14:53,800","14:58,520","\"I'm doing epic wind style now. You gotta wait for your combos. You're in your combos back fast\""]
["14:58,520","15:03,320","\"Dave you're so good at dames\""]
["15:03,320","15:11,680","\"Dave I just realized what your fucking thing is in coming back. Are you mashing and not letting that thing charge?\""]
["15:11,680","15:17,300","\"Well, I keep seeing it like stopping it's charging. That's why it's not charging\""]
["15:17,300","15:19,300","\"It's a mashing\""]
["15:19,300","15:30,540","\"No no no. No no. No fucking no. I'm saying it just now. I'm bashing the ever-loving fuck out of this shit. You gotta wait for that shit to charge because if you do you're gonna be penalized without charging. That's why\""]
["15:30,540","15:48,820","\"That's why shit happened before. Man, I find that decision to make it like Battlefield flip into the view of the ground to be the most bizarre of charging. Because it's like, it's such an ugly, like boring picture now. Why not just show the nice backdrop? I know. I also don't like how close it gets to the screen.\""]
["15:48,820","15:52,980","\"It's too big. It's a little too close and I don't understand the angle.\""]
["15:52,980","15:57,680","\"And I swear there must be some reason. There must be.\""]
["15:57,680","15:59,680","\"There must be, but it's for what it is.\""]
["15:59,680","16:01,180","\"I don't know what the reason is.\""]
["16:01,180","16:03,660","\"It's just because they want more space between like-\""]
["16:03,660","16:05,660","\"It's because of the real time combat.\""]
["16:05,660","16:10,200","\"It's easy to put this flat this over because you're still on the game.\""]
["16:10,200","16:11,200","\"I actually know what it is now.\""]
["16:11,200","16:14,200","\"It's because the ground is like bending down at the side and if it was flipped up,\""]
["16:14,200","16:18,680","\"they've got a shader so that all the characters appear over everything it looks like.\""]
["16:18,680","16:22,680","\"Yeah, the perspective looks 3D, but it's to, you know,\""]
["16:22,680","16:25,080","\"just the way the 3D is.\""]
["16:25,080","16:28,540","\"Maybe they just all have two clothes together, too.\""]
["16:28,540","16:30,460","\"I like the Likitun monster thing.\""]
["16:30,460","16:31,500","\"I like his design.\""]
["16:31,500","16:35,260","\"My only problem is his lighting.\""]
["16:35,260","16:36,820","\"All you're gonna bitch about this time.\""]
["16:36,820","16:38,500","\"His lighting compared to them.\""]
["16:38,500","16:39,660","\"He has like a brighter lighting.\""]
["16:39,660","16:40,500","\"It's just weird.\""]
["16:40,500","16:42,300","\"Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch, Corey.\""]
["16:42,300","16:43,300","\"I like the dark lighting.\""]
["16:43,300","16:44,140","\"It looks good.\""]
["16:44,140","16:45,340","\"Oh, complain.\""]
["16:45,340","16:48,220","\"I mean, compliment, compliment, compliment, Corey.\""]
["16:48,220","16:51,720","\"Hey guys, oh six there in silence\""]
["16:51,720","17:00,620","\"I\""]
["17:00,620","17:05,820","\"Wanted to put a bully in his place. That's all I wanted to stand up for the little guy yeah\""]
["17:05,820","17:10,660","\"Yeah, I do wish the death animation was something it doesn't even need to be cut comes in back\""]
["17:10,660","17:12,660","\"I like that back\""]
["17:13,860","17:19,900","\"Exploded into like 400 bones and just blood and gore everywhere and the characters reacted by throwing blood off of them\""]
["17:19,900","17:23,240","\"There you go. I take that fuck fuck. Come on Dave\""]
["17:23,240","17:30,200","\"I want banana splits to be the reward for every quest. Yeah, can I just die and explode in like a pile of maggots\""]
["17:30,200","17:41,520","\"You know what Cory, I think you're on to something there. Yeah, yeah, we'll save that for never comps\""]
["17:41,520","17:42,840","\"All these paintings are in...\""]
["17:42,840","17:44,120","\"Oh, you dickhead.\""]
["17:44,120","17:45,120","\"Oh, hello!\""]
["17:45,120","17:46,680","\"You had shit.\""]
["17:46,680","17:49,720","\"Um, the text is kind of blocking the action.\""]
["17:49,720","17:52,120","\"Oh, crap.\""]
["17:52,120","17:55,280","\"Why does she get hurt so much?\""]
["17:55,280","17:57,840","\"'Cause she's a fucking healer, and she sucks.\""]
["17:57,840","18:00,640","\"Why does she kill a tiger when I'm red?\""]
["18:00,640","18:02,200","\"Oh, I know why, Dave.\""]
["18:02,200","18:03,920","\"It's 'cause she doesn't have any fucking armor on.\""]
["18:03,920","18:06,440","\"She just wears like a knighting gown with a tiger.\""]
["18:06,440","18:07,480","\"Oh, yeah, it's again.\""]
["18:07,480","18:09,200","\"Little stupid bitch.\""]
["18:09,200","18:11,000","\"Unless, at least that dude is properly...\""]
["18:11,000","18:15,000","\"Whoa, it's like in full heel every couple seconds.\""]
["18:15,000","18:19,500","\"I like his designs.\""]
["18:19,500","18:21,400","\"I think it's because she's a healer.\""]
["18:21,400","18:24,400","\"I feel like there's something, there's like a portion of like the combat we're not understanding\""]
["18:24,400","18:26,700","\"because we haven't like properly read everything.\""]
["18:26,700","18:29,700","\"I mean, no, it's about like stacking combos.\""]
["18:29,700","18:33,600","\"When you get four party members, you basically create a combo.\""]
["18:33,600","18:37,800","\"So you see like X, Y, X, X, you can, you don't have to press all of them at the same time,\""]
["18:37,800","18:40,820","\"But if you press like XXY, you do the comp--\""]
["18:40,820","18:42,140","\"you're supposed to stack combos.\""]
["18:42,140","18:43,140","\"That's the point of the game.\""]

["18:51,220","18:53,100","\"But at the same time, you're not really struggling\""]
["18:53,100","18:54,940","\"with the combat, so it's not that bad.\""]
["18:54,940","18:57,860","\"I really like these little outdoor scenes here.\""]

["19:22,020","19:35,120","\"You hold X and then you let go it's kind of like putting your own little like bouncy thing out the wall then do it\""]
["19:35,120","19:47,840","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, there you go. Oh man. I'm a fucking ins. This is the best you gave us drinks. Yes! Oh shit, go get this shit. Oh, my...\""]
