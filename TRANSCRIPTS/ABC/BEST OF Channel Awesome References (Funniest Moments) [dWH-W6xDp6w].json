["35:24,580","35:29,280","\"This is my theory about what happened there, right? I think because\""]
["35:29,280","35:35,100","\"One of the cast members is a furry. Mm-hmm. He recommended Doug like oh, I know a person who makes\""]
["35:35,100","35:41,080","\"Really cool monsters because you said you were looking for monsters for your wall review. Yeah, I bet Doug just saw those designs\""]

["35:44,640","35:49,980","\"Sexualized furry dragons at all. I think he might have actually just the skin\""]
["35:50,980","35:55,460","\"Yeah, I think he's literally just oblivious to how the internet works just oblivious to that\""]
["35:55,460","35:59,140","\"I know he knows what a furry is but I think he saw those and he didn't really see them as furries\""]
["35:59,140","36:03,820","\"To him he probably saw like nightmare before Christmas looking\""]
["36:03,820","36:09,360","\"Yeah, like that but to the the perverted untrained eye you see like these\""]
["36:09,360","36:15,980","\"Pregnaded bellies with like girdling sounds. I hate I look okay. I will say I hate a lot of those things\""]
["36:15,980","36:19,960","\"But there was one that I thought look cool was was the guy with the mats fries\""]
["36:19,960","36:25,440","\"He did look cool. He looked like something that would be in that it did actually look like something that would be in\""]
["36:25,440","36:29,400","\"Nightmare before Christmas like that thing, you know, I don't want to falter\""]
["36:29,400","36:33,360","\"Um, I don't want to fault the artists because you know it is what it is\""]
["36:33,360","36:40,940","\"But wow, it's just when you see that stuff just from my personal experience the first thing that comes to my mind is those like\""]
["36:40,940","36:47,580","\"low-quality gurgling sounds of people being swallowed in 3d with those hyper realistic hair things like\""]
["36:48,220","36:51,940","\"Look I want to get cut that guy some slack to the the animator because\""]
["36:51,940","36:55,740","\"It's not the worst shit I've ever seen in my life\""]
["36:55,740","37:00,620","\"I just don't like the designs because I'm not into that kind of shit. I don't like that hair design is all\""]
["37:00,620","37:07,060","\"Like me neither, but I don't take it as bad as it could have been no. Yeah, I think the 3d\""]

["37:10,380","37:15,220","\"I mainly just find it funny that all the male characters had motherbearing hips and pushed out\""]
["37:15,220","37:21,420","\"They did. They're pregnant bellies, motherbearing hits, massive factities, and like, and they all had the same fucking face.\""]
["37:21,420","37:26,820","\"And the whole point of that segment was to be like, \"\"Look at our unique monsters. If we can do it, why couldn't the wall do it?\"\"\""]

["37:46,020","37:51,460","\"I love nostalgia critic and the wall review was it was cringe, but it's super cringe\""]
["37:51,460","37:55,700","\"I can appreciate the amount of effort that went into the fucking thing because the goddamn thing is like\""]
["37:55,700","38:00,140","\"For a very amateurly put-together thing. There was a lot of effort\""]
["38:00,140","38:02,140","\"He's like at the end of it like\""]
["38:02,140","38:07,420","\"The main joke of it all was that he he ripped it apart, but that at the end of it\""]
["38:07,420","38:10,700","\"He says something like it was weird. It was a little pretentious, but I liked it\""]
["38:10,700","38:16,040","\"Yeah, so he did this it's like almost like I did this whole parody just for a simple joke, but I\""]
["38:16,040","38:20,200","\"Mean he I think he deserves to be knocked down a peg a little bit\""]
["38:20,200","38:26,240","\"But I also don't think he meant to do such harm. Yeah, this might humble him a bit which might be good now\""]
["38:26,240","38:30,800","\"I will not defend him for his weird cat review. He did with\""]
["38:30,800","38:37,780","\"Simmas knob I fucking hated that review you get no sympathy for me from that young man, dude\""]
["38:37,780","38:43,300","\"The wall review I'll give you credit for the amount of effort. No you put into it\""]
["38:43,300","38:48,700","\"It was definitely a well-designed job, but no it's not it's terrible\""]
["38:48,700","38:52,500","\"No, it was well designed for like an amateur sleep together\""]
["38:52,500","38:54,500","\"It's weirdly high production\""]
["38:54,500","39:00,380","\"A lot of effort to it and he spent probably spent a lot of money on it\""]

["39:28,940","39:29,940","\"Yeah.\""]
["39:29,940","39:32,040","\"Maybe he deserves it back a little bit.\""]
["39:32,040","39:36,740","\"To be fair, people were like, \"\"Who's crucified? He's never gonna recover from this.\"\"\""]
["39:36,840","39:42,780","\"That's stupid. He literally just released an Aladdin and Hannibal review and people are already like I like the Hannibal review\""]

["40:10,760","40:11,760","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["40:11,760","40:15,680","\"But he did say other stupid shit like he said one of the songs was an Oscar-bait song\""]

["40:27,600","40:32,800","\"It's probably the only Pink Floyd album that I actually know because the only songs I've\""]

["40:49,080","40:54,880","\"So wait that's another weird thing. It's like those aren't even the nostalgic critics like original creatures. He like that's the thing\""]
["40:54,880","41:00,560","\"I think he rented fetish characters. Yeah, that's the thing. It's really funny. I think he literally did that\""]
