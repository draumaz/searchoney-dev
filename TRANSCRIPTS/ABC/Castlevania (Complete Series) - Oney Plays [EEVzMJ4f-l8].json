["35:35,860","35:43,220","\"But you're basically gonna be bumping around like a dumbass and getting hurt constantly losing your rings until you master the level and the layout and\""]
["35:43,220","35:45,620","\"Then that's when you're like hey guys\""]
["35:45,620","35:49,980","\"I can beat sonic - then your friends come over and you can show how fucking cool you are my least favorite\""]
["35:49,980","35:56,080","\"I figured like so leave my least favorite thing about 2d sonic is the camera. It's that it has you focused centered\""]
["35:56,540","36:01,420","\"You're completely centered in the screen so you're running to the right you can't see anything coming at you\""]
["36:01,420","36:02,420","\"If you're going to\""]
["36:02,420","36:07,240","\"problem with that is because of how fucking close it is to yeah that's who when the games like\""]
["36:07,240","36:12,500","\"Ben re-released is like HD and like expanded the screen so you can see more of the left and more of the right\""]
["36:12,500","36:13,540","\"It makes it so much better\""]
["36:13,540","36:19,060","\"Yeah, see stuff coming in and it just makes it more I understand like when I played Sonic 2 on the Genesis\""]
["36:19,060","36:23,220","\"I pretty much just love the speed it was giving me and the music was amazing and everything\""]
["36:23,220","36:30,540","\"It was just like a fucking sensory overload, but it's also like zoom fucking close to shit and it's not the best to play\""]
["36:30,540","36:34,320","\"You play like the the ones that's been remade by a cushiony\""]
["36:34,320","36:38,980","\"Quischen white head and it's like much better. Yeah\""]
["36:38,980","36:41,540","\"Same with Sonic 1. I did I\""]
["36:41,540","36:47,900","\"Don't like Sonic 1 multiple times never finished it, but I did like the Sonic advanced game. It's not a boring\""]
["36:47,900","36:50,940","\"I'm sorry. I hate to say it, but Sonic 1 is honestly\""]
["36:50,940","36:54,720","\"How is it to break the balance on platforms or you phone at the lab and then I stop yeah\""]
["36:54,720","36:57,860","\"double zone fucking god dude. I love the music there though\""]
["36:57,860","37:03,020","\"But uh, I mean like sonic one like the green hills is fun. It's a good opening stage\""]
["37:03,020","37:05,660","\"It's like iconic with its setup, but then like so good\""]
["37:05,660","37:08,980","\"It just gets kind of monotonous because you go from like sonic one\""]
["37:08,980","37:15,180","\"It's like you're flying through green hills and you go to marble zone and you kind of meander over lava platforms and like yeah\""]
["37:15,180","37:18,860","\"It's like the worst second level ever. Yeah, and then the next level is\""]
["37:19,740","37:25,460","\"God what is it? It's like the casino place I believe right? I don't like that one either\""]
["37:25,460","37:30,100","\"But then it's like the water one which is the worst one labyrinth zone every every level\""]
["37:30,100","37:33,300","\"But then then it's starlight and starlight fucking rocks\""]
["37:33,300","37:38,340","\"I love starlight most of the levels just suck the play through and then it's the egg egg zone and it sucks\""]
["37:38,340","37:44,780","\"Yeah, Sonic 2 is just good from start to finish almost every level in Sonic 2 is just like I've never played it\""]
["37:44,780","37:46,480","\"Dude, it moves, it moves.\""]
["37:46,480","37:48,940","\"Like the pacing, you're gonna beat Sonic 2\""]
["37:48,940","37:50,780","\"in less than an hour.\""]
["37:50,780","37:52,280","\"You could beat it in like 45...\""]
["37:52,280","37:53,780","\"- Really? - Two an hour, yeah.\""]
["37:53,780","37:54,780","\"It's easy.\""]
["37:54,780","37:55,980","\"I mean, it's Sonic game.\""]
["37:55,980","37:57,480","\"If you don't stop to look at it,\""]
["37:57,480","37:59,080","\"I look at all the fucking sprite work,\""]
["37:59,080","38:00,580","\"you can beat it pretty quickly.\""]
["38:00,580","38:02,380","\"And Sonic, you're not meant to just look at Shae.\""]
["38:02,380","38:04,380","\"You're supposed to run and let the zone, like,\""]
["38:04,380","38:05,880","\"kinda of the breeze by you.\""]
["38:05,880","38:07,780","\"And the way that it designed Sonic 2\""]
["38:07,780","38:10,580","\"was they designed it to keep the momentum going,\""]
["38:10,580","38:12,380","\"to keep the motion moving forward.\""]
["38:12,380","38:13,980","\"- I will say, though, that, uh...\""]
["38:13,980","38:18,920","\"I tried playing Sonic Mania. I couldn't get into it either. I don't blame you the thing about really\""]
["38:18,920","38:23,480","\"I really like mania, but it's because of my bias towards Sonic games\""]
["38:23,480","38:28,500","\"Obviously so I enjoyed mania way more than the average person\""]
["38:28,500","38:32,780","\"But mania is just like honestly some of those stages like seven minutes long\""]
["38:32,780","38:38,820","\"I just I didn't see any like real innovation or anything like the graphics were nice\""]
["38:38,820","38:42,860","\"You can say what it actually is Chris. It's just like a glorified mod. Yeah\""]
["38:43,340","38:49,760","\"That's what it is, but I mean I appreciate the effort. Yeah, it's not for me. Have you played Castlevania for?\""]
["38:49,760","38:52,420","\"Yeah, I like that one\""]
["38:52,420","38:57,520","\"All directions I just like the music and the art\""]
["38:57,520","39:03,700","\"Honestly, yeah, the gameplay itself is just whatever actually no\""]
["39:03,700","39:10,380","\"Alright, we're gonna get butt-thunk here. Okay, but fucking rondo of blood rondo blood is run over me\""]
["39:10,540","39:14,940","\"Fucking rock really yes, it is but you're about to say that different\""]
["39:14,940","39:19,960","\"No, the Sega one or the one that they released on Super Nintendo can suck my fucking asshole\""]
["39:19,960","39:25,660","\"Dracula X Dracula X sucks so fucking bad. That was really really good. Yeah, good job\""]
["39:25,660","39:34,120","\"Damn it. You remember that they were like guys play where the fucking where Richter came from\""]
["39:34,120","39:38,820","\"No, yeah, we're gonna tend to totally really Dracula X. That's the one they had\""]
["39:38,820","39:45,240","\"Fuck you dumb assholes. You play Rondo blood in this collection pack or you can get like that weird 3d one for PS\""]
["39:45,240","39:48,680","\"Dude, we should play Rondo. I fucking love Rondo\""]
["39:48,680","39:53,880","\"That has some of the best music in any video game fucking ever the same lady who did it\""]
["39:53,880","39:57,380","\"I don't have no fucking play might be she was a mag fest\""]
["39:57,380","40:03,780","\"It has like one of the best soundtracks. I would say like every game is just like fucking amazing except for like maybe\""]
["40:05,100","40:10,240","\"The Lord of Shadows. I really like the Lord of Shadows. I tried playing that back in the day and I hated it. It's music\""]
["40:10,240","40:17,240","\"Just it's kind of just more atmospheric. This hallways really hard. Also this came this soon. Lord of Shadows was weird\""]
["40:17,240","40:24,680","\"I can't really explain it to me the game felt really claustrophobic and then they like put you in rooms where you just battle enemies\""]
["40:24,680","40:30,020","\"We're just like it pretty much comes to a point where you feel like you're just fighting enemies more so than playing the game. Oh\""]
["40:30,020","40:33,060","\"God damn, this is hard. Holy shit. Oh\""]
["40:33,640","40:39,620","\"Was really good Dave you're doing the old throw the cross do the pit. Yeah, this is the hardest part of the game hands down\""]
["40:39,620","40:44,840","\"Yeah, this is um this in the Dracula fight at the end or tough death is intimately difficult\""]
["40:44,840","40:49,000","\"I like the sound of his menu screaming for his life\""]
["40:49,000","40:53,040","\"Actually, I prefer\""]
["40:53,040","40:54,920","\"Castlevania 1 over\""]
["40:54,920","40:59,960","\"Symphony of the night. I prefer how simple it is really just in design. Yeah, this is a damn good game\""]
["40:59,960","41:03,240","\"Even though I never played something red skeletons up top you\""]
["41:03,240","41:10,240","\"That's annoying. It's not perfect. I'm just saying I wish there was more Castlevania games that weren't like like Metroidvania guys\""]
["41:10,240","41:12,480","\"You should Debbie play Castlevania 3\""]
["41:12,480","41:15,320","\"You and Avijen could go cry me a fucking river\""]
["41:15,320","41:21,440","\"What do you mean? Avijen feels the same way he wishes that like there were more of the classic cry you were river\""]
["41:21,440","41:23,440","\"What was that supposed to mean?\""]
["41:23,440","41:25,440","\"Why?\""]
["41:25,440","41:28,760","\"I wish there were more classic Castlevania games, but you know honestly\""]
["41:29,480","41:34,180","\"That game they released that was in in cahoots with the new bloodline game\""]
["41:34,180","41:36,480","\"Yeah, it was simple\""]
["41:36,480","41:41,320","\"But it was nice seeing that kind of aesthetic again, and I did like it to a degree\""]
["41:41,320","41:47,640","\"But it was like insanely easy for a Castlevania game. Yeah, I'd be that's what I could try\""]
["41:47,640","41:53,760","\"I like the challenge and the grind and I like just the really simple design and I like how super linear it is\""]
["41:53,760","41:57,000","\"It's called super Nintendo hard or certain Nintendo hard\""]
["41:57,000","42:02,960","\"I tried playing simply of the night like a few years ago. I was just like all these fucking rooms look too similar\""]
["42:02,960","42:05,680","\"I'm getting lost too easily a little ago. I didn't put it\""]
["42:05,680","42:09,040","\"But I got like a good portion of the way through it. Yeah, I love it a lot\""]
["42:09,040","42:14,840","\"But yeah, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I don't mean to like go back to this this old this old bone, but\""]
["42:14,840","42:17,400","\"honestly\""]
["42:17,400","42:21,040","\"Nintendo wraps it Chris. It's about being Nintendo hard. You're right\""]
["42:21,040","42:25,940","\"He was he was singing the tune that you want to say I love Nintendo\""]
["42:25,940","42:29,540","\"Nintendo it is no mystery\""]
["42:29,540","42:42,940","\"Mama I just lost the game mama. I just lost the game winks at camera to the audience\""]
["42:51,540","42:55,240","\"You Christ and alright lol. I'm just gonna go right back\""]

["49:18,960","49:23,500","\"What did like did Twitter have something to say about this? Yeah, no, Twitter is freaking out the whole up\""]
["49:23,500","49:24,780","\"No, here's the thing right?\""]
["49:24,780","49:29,100","\"I was just like I went on Twitter and I was expecting like people to be like what the fuck and literally known was like\""]

["49:33,700","49:35,700","\"And then people were like\""]
["49:35,700","49:42,380","\"And then people started complaining and then rocker respond was like oh, yeah, I thought that was kind of weird too and I was like\""]

["49:56,420","49:59,100","\"Fucking Nobuo Matsu composed...\""]
["49:59,100","50:03,380","\"Dude, he arranged songs for orchestra himself for an album he did\""]
["50:03,380","50:07,220","\"That were all new arrangements, like right before this concert got organized.\""]
["50:07,220","50:09,780","\"He had all these new arrangements for a thing.\""]
["50:09,780","50:10,780","\"Why do they do that?\""]
["50:10,780","50:13,380","\"Why did they play any of the songs from the new FF7 games?\""]
["50:13,380","50:14,580","\"I've seen them in the two!\""]

["50:16,580","50:19,940","\"There's all these fucking new things they could have done and they just went and they\""]
["50:19,940","50:24,980","\"played shit from Distant World 1 and like one new song from Distant World 3 and it's\""]
["50:24,980","50:27,220","\"like this is all shit I've heard a million times before.\""]
["50:27,220","50:28,380","\"I was so fucking sick.\""]
["50:28,380","50:29,380","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["50:29,380","50:33,660","\"I mean this isn't the same situation but I kind of feel the same way with what happened\""]
["50:33,660","50:37,620","\"to me when I purchased Dragon Quest 11 for PS4.\""]
["50:37,620","50:38,620","\"Yeah, yeah you totally.\""]
["50:38,620","50:43,020","\"He's so fucking mad. Yeah, I played that game. I got it for PS4\""]
["50:43,020","50:50,060","\"I was really excited and when I found out that we were gonna get the inferior midi version because the dude's just fucking racist to America\""]
["50:50,060","50:55,060","\"He just hates America. Yeah, it's like a running joke there, but it's not a very funny fucking joke\""]
["50:55,060","51:00,360","\"But like basically I played all of Dragon Quest. I didn't beat it sadly\""]
["51:00,360","51:02,980","\"I literally got to the last boss of act look\""]
["51:02,980","51:07,320","\"Okay, so I beat the game and I did the new game like the after game to like the last last boss\""]
["51:07,320","51:11,860","\"Yeah, but I was so upset that I didn't play it and now I see everyone like that quest level\""]
["51:11,860","51:17,420","\"It's great. I love it on the switch the music so good and it kind of just like it kind of feels like I have a pit\""]
["51:17,420","51:20,460","\"That's like I can't feel that spot in my heart with a fucking game\""]
["51:20,460","51:24,380","\"Yeah, and so no matter what I will not buy that game for switch\""]
["51:24,380","51:29,380","\"And if you like it, no, it's fine if you like it. I'm glad no\""]
["51:29,380","51:35,660","\"I bought it on ps4 do not buy it on ps4. Okay boy caught the rest of the games on ps4\""]
["51:35,660","51:41,640","\"Get it for the switch. I paid so wait, you haven't really explained it like fully basically the guy who does the music\""]
["51:41,640","51:44,660","\"He just proposes amazing orchestras. He's great\""]
["51:44,660","51:51,060","\"But he he makes damn well sure that there's only mid-eye files for Americans. Yeah, he's like Americans only reason\""]
["51:51,060","51:53,620","\"Are you sure that's true? Yes?\""]
["51:54,020","52:00,220","\"He owns the rights of the song so he sells them independently from the game to the American companies who can't afford them\""]
["52:00,220","52:01,780","\"Yeah, so hopefully you know\""]
["52:01,780","52:05,260","\"He croaks and then some other person gets like a fucking hold of the copyright\""]
["52:05,260","52:11,860","\"But basically like the reason why Dragon Quest 8 had an orchestral con like an orchestral concert\""]
["52:11,860","52:15,660","\"I can't say this orchestral concert an orchestral concert piece\""]
["52:15,660","52:21,840","\"Was by accident. Yeah, we did Japan got the MIDI for that one because we got the expanded dq8\""]
["52:21,840","52:24,920","\"We got to like this the orchestra. That's so fucking weird\""]
["52:24,920","52:29,700","\"And they even have the mini version for the one they put on 3ds even though it sounds good and it was fun\""]
["52:29,700","52:32,100","\"It's still inferior to the original orchestra\""]
["52:32,100","52:38,240","\"Here's here's my sob story. Yeah back like nobody was carrying a dragon quest for years\""]
["52:38,240","52:43,040","\"So I petitioned to get seven on 3ds and I waited four years for the Japanese version\""]
["52:43,040","52:48,400","\"And then I finally came out after I listened to like the orchestra soundtrack for fucking\""]
["52:49,240","52:53,140","\"Yes, yeah for like a long ass time like just signing these petitions and waiting\""]
["52:53,140","52:58,140","\"We got the game and it was it was the mitties and it kind of ruined the game for me\""]
["52:58,140","53:03,360","\"Yeah, I played 40 hours of it may be too sad. I didn't play eight hundred and twenty hours and eight\""]
["53:03,360","53:07,560","\"And I stopped playing it. Oh, yeah, by the way, and he also has the MIDI\""]
["53:07,560","53:12,040","\"I can imagine her frustrating that is because when Final Fantasy 7 came out back in\""]
["53:12,040","53:18,760","\"97 yeah, it was a PC port and I and I really wanted the PC port for just just to say I have the PC port\""]
["53:18,760","53:24,580","\"Yeah, and when I played it it had mid-eye files on it cuz it couldn't fit like wave files on it at the time\""]
["53:24,580","53:26,580","\"Yeah, this was back in 98\""]
["53:26,580","53:33,420","\"But um that like it must be so frustrating just knowing the only fucking reason is because the guy's racist\""]
["53:33,420","53:35,860","\"Yeah, no it is and then they joke about it\""]
["53:35,860","53:39,100","\"But you can see tons of people talk about it online. He just doesn't care\""]
["53:39,100","53:45,980","\"You know why it's because the game doesn't do good. Why the fucking game doesn't do good\""]
["53:45,980","53:50,540","\"It's because you release every other spin-off game. You don't release the main series\""]
["53:50,540","53:56,380","\"That's why nobody fucking plays it you can't if you release the fucking game is in America\""]
["53:56,380","54:05,300","\"Chris you love you ever be both. It's great. It really pissed me off because Dave got I did got me in a dragon quest\""]
["54:05,300","54:11,360","\"I played it. I enjoyed the fuck out of it. I just want to say they made damn well sure that when they released eight on the 3ds\""]
["54:11,360","54:17,840","\"All the orchestral music was gone. Yeah and bitify and it's it but the orchestral 3ds version in Japan as a worker\""]
["54:17,840","54:29,580","\"All right right before this concert came out Naboo Matsu\""]
["54:29,580","54:34,960","\"No, he's awesome dude. He's easily\""]
["54:36,360","54:42,280","\"I think he's the only person that when they die like that's a celebrity. I look up to I will actually cry like he's fair\""]
["54:42,280","54:50,540","\"He's everything I love about music, but anyway fucking he did this album called bra bra brass final fantasy 7 and it had all these amazing\""]
["54:50,540","54:55,340","\"Arrangements that they could have used for that concert like mages. Yeah, okay\""]
["54:55,340","55:01,680","\"Is he part of like mages? Yeah the band I think he's the keyboard guy because he plays piano\""]
["55:03,400","55:05,400","\"What dude have you ever seen?\""]
["55:05,400","55:09,600","\"The clip of them playing one-wing an angel no, I've never seen it\""]
["55:09,600","55:15,600","\"It's really funny cuz no boo matzu is really cool and really like like all at the time of recording this\""]
["55:15,600","55:19,560","\"He was having the fucking time of his life on keyboards. He was like doing all this like crazy like\""]
["55:19,560","55:24,460","\"Yeah, he's like really expressive with his body language and dance all over and all that's the band mates are just standing there\""]
["55:24,460","55:28,480","\"Stiff is a board like they're really good, but they literally just stand with like a stick up their ass\""]
["55:31,760","55:34,480","\"Dancing all over the stage and playing keyboard like a fucking psycho\""]
["55:34,480","55:41,120","\"I'll just be I'll be really sad just because I know how much he shaped my love for music and exactly what I like in music\""]
["55:41,120","55:48,280","\"Is you pretty much due to him so like that that will be like a killer. Yeah, but hopefully he lives for another hundred years\""]
["55:48,280","55:52,360","\"Yeah, you know, they're gonna discover aging and he'll be the first one to get the serum like\""]
["55:52,360","55:54,760","\"I'm just gonna\""]
["55:54,760","55:56,760","\"I\""]

["56:00,400","56:03,240","\"Yeah, I want to cock. Thanks Corey\""]
["56:03,240","56:09,160","\"He recently stopped touring due to health issues, so that's bad. That's sad man. That sucks\""]
["56:09,160","56:11,640","\"That's not a good sign\""]
["56:11,640","56:17,520","\"It sucks, but well again, maybe they discover aging or maybe they put his body into a robot and he becomes the first Android\""]
["56:17,520","56:20,440","\"There was one mag fest where he was literally just hanging out with people\""]
["56:20,440","56:26,840","\"Be like ah, I was like that's not boom. That's it. That's fucking awesome. He is like a fucking genius. Yeah\""]

["56:36,120","56:43,440","\"They're literally gifted. I don't know if I ever talked about it, but I feel like Naboo Matzoo's super duper inspired by the never-ending story soundtrack\""]
["56:43,440","56:48,400","\"What I'm not sure if I if I've seen it somewhere, but I was listening to the never-ending story soundtrack\""]
["56:48,400","56:52,400","\"And I'm like that sounds really like this song and then it happened like three times in a row\""]
["56:52,400","56:56,600","\"Or I'm like that sounds just like this song the main theme and never-ending story is so catchy\""]
