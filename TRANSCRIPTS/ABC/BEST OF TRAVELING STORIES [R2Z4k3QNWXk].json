["30:07,760","30:12,080","\"Literally every single place the guy went, he created a bad story about himself.\""]
["30:12,080","30:13,880","\"Like, I'll just say that.\""]
["30:13,880","30:17,560","\"And I also thought his content sucked and he annoyed me.\""]
["30:17,560","30:22,200","\"So like, I basically got really drunk and just told him to his face that I hated his\""]
["30:22,200","30:23,600","\"shit.\""]
["30:23,600","30:27,400","\"And it was in the height of his career too.\""]
