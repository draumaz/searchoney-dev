["00:11,520","00:15,920","\"From early childhood, I was trained to deal with the dark side of the supernatural.\""]
["00:15,920","00:18,880","\"I'm sleeping, you wouldn't believe.\""]
["00:18,880","00:24,640","\"A couple of weeks ago, mutilated bodies of tourists were founded in a long-lived valley.\""]
