["05:15,340","05:18,260","\"They added like tons of the\""]
["05:18,260","05:22,300","\"And every boss at the end of that bloodstain ritual night\""]
["05:22,300","05:28,100","\"They always have this like finish or move that hit you in one hit and you always have to avoid it. It's that shit\""]
["05:28,100","05:32,860","\"I wonder if this that was a symptom of a night. That is so fucking tricky that they try and do that to you\""]
["05:32,860","05:37,540","\"Every single boss does it so it's like you always see it coming in the game luckily that game's easy as piss\""]
["05:37,540","05:39,540","\"So it's not the worst thing but\""]
["05:39,540","05:45,940","\"Also, so like this game that they're not telling you upfront like Castlevania 3 does but this game is\""]

["06:10,220","06:15,380","\"Look you can tell her you can see like the bullets like going through their body before they fire out. Oh, it's really cool\""]
["06:15,380","06:17,700","\"It's a smart design\""]
["06:17,700","06:19,860","\"How did Dracula hire all these fucks?\""]
["06:19,860","06:26,420","\"It just like kind of came with the territory once he brought the castle to life they were just there\""]
["06:26,420","06:29,140","\"That's fair\""]
["06:29,140","06:35,180","\"Kind of like tenants that Dracula forgot about every single person hanging by the shackles of Heather legs ripped off\""]
["06:35,180","06:39,140","\"Basically what you are essentially my dick you look at it\""]
["06:39,140","06:46,520","\"What a Richter is is he's essentially like an old-timey shark who's going in and just taking penance out one by one\""]

["06:48,520","06:54,460","\"Yeah, you're the landlord you're you raining hell on those who haven't paid. Oh my god. Hey damn\""]
["06:54,460","07:09,640","\"Dude, I love his throwing animation though again, we made this joke before but eventually you just fall into a pile\""]
["07:09,640","07:13,400","\"We're doing that so you only have so many ribcage you can throw bitch\""]
["07:13,400","07:14,400","\"Fuck.\""]
["07:14,400","07:22,480","\"Unless he's just like a bastard who still has friends bones and he's tossing those.\""]
["07:22,480","07:24,760","\"The bones of the other people who died.\""]
["07:24,760","07:28,880","\"If I was a skeleton, I would take other people's bones and stick them onto me and become like\""]
["07:28,880","07:32,040","\"weird, transformation skeleton thing.\""]
["07:32,040","07:34,080","\"It's not a bad idea.\""]
["07:34,080","07:36,880","\"I would set an example for other skeletons.\""]
["07:36,880","07:40,480","\"So then when you come inside, you see these weird deformed skeletons all because of me.\""]
["07:40,480","07:42,920","\"I'm the orchestrator.\""]
["07:42,920","07:45,720","\"I would make sure to kill you first. I can't order to share any further.\""]
["07:45,720","07:50,560","\"I'd be the one passing out bones and you knock off my fucking hands so I can't do anything.\""]
["07:50,560","07:52,800","\"Like Corin would fuck you getting all these bones.\""]
["07:52,800","07:55,480","\"Look at these people hanging up there.\""]
["07:55,480","07:57,040","\"That sucks.\""]
["07:57,040","07:58,560","\"Every single one of them had their legs cut off.\""]
["07:58,560","08:00,360","\"Yeah, that's unfortunate.\""]
["08:00,360","08:02,120","\"They don't need a pee though.\""]
["08:02,120","08:04,280","\"Yeah, that's true.\""]
["08:04,280","08:06,040","\"You saved them the trouble.\""]
["08:06,040","08:08,040","\"I didn't fucking do it.\""]
["08:08,040","08:09,720","\"That's Dracula.\""]
["08:10,040","08:15,620","\"Well to say that you didn't save those guys the trouble. Oh, there's a hidden akerage. Oh\""]
["08:15,620","08:20,680","\"Just go around whatever\""]
["08:20,680","08:24,400","\"Go up there. I fucking wanted to go up there anyway. You go up the stairs. Oh, yeah\""]
["08:24,400","08:27,140","\"You're making yourself look so stupid\""]
["08:27,140","08:30,840","\"I didn't mean that Dave. I'm sorry\""]
["08:30,840","08:33,880","\"Dave. I'm really sorry man. Yeah, yeah\""]

["09:24,760","09:28,560","\"How come they can't get bought a chain\""]
["09:28,560","09:32,540","\"It's true with the fuck they're made of explosions\""]

["18:29,120","18:33,840","\"The moment I realized I don't care about that kind of shit was when I played vice city as a kid right and\""]

["18:39,600","18:45,740","\"And when I finally did it it gave me a t-shirt that said I beat Vice City 100% and all I got was this lousy t-shirt\""]
["18:45,740","18:49,720","\"That's awesome, which is pretty much the same as an achievement right all it is\""]
["18:49,720","18:54,960","\"It's one little thing that says I did it right yeah that I didn't feel any better. I didn't feel fulfilled\""]
["18:54,960","18:58,760","\"I didn't feel like I accomplished anything worthwhile right what you do feel\""]
["18:58,760","19:03,720","\"Achievement in playing the game is getting so good at a game that you're beating it with pure skill\""]
["19:03,720","19:06,600","\"That's the most achieved you will feel playing anything. Yeah\""]
["19:08,080","19:11,160","\"So fuck achievements the end to be fair\""]
["19:11,160","19:18,320","\"Like achievements nowadays they are they do do just feel like they're tossed in and not even like really any thought\""]
["19:18,320","19:23,360","\"It's but think of the last time you saw an achievement in a game that was worth putting effort in getting honestly\""]
["19:23,360","19:25,280","\"I'll be honest\""]
["19:25,280","19:27,960","\"And yet you probably don't care because I don't even think you really like the game\""]
["19:27,960","19:33,240","\"But biting of Isaac has some really fucking dastardly achievement that like require a lot of like\""]

["19:39,200","19:43,820","\"They expect you to do in that game, but I will give credit where credit is due getting those achievements\""]
["19:43,820","19:48,020","\"Rewards you with an item in the game. That's pretty cool. Every achievement is an item in the game\""]
["19:48,020","19:56,820","\"I feel like getting getting actual in-game rewards that alter the gameplay for a fresh experience is the peak of design for that kind\""]
["19:56,820","20:00,080","\"I mean, that's why you're feeling rewarded. It's not because of the achievement itself\""]
["20:00,080","20:03,640","\"Exactly achievement was gone and you still got the item you feel the exact same way\""]
["20:03,640","20:11,200","\"No, yeah, I guess I also do kind of feel like I accomplished something when I look at my like 800 achievements from binding of Isaac\""]
["20:11,200","20:17,320","\"And I'm like nice. I play this game for 600 hours, and I got nearly everything right and no one else will care about me\""]
["20:17,320","20:21,520","\"Well, I'm just not the same. It's okay Chris\""]
["20:21,520","20:27,200","\"But I'm talking about that as my own regard because with Isaac there are some achievements in that game\""]
["20:27,600","20:32,640","\"Then I'm like yeah, I got that achievement. I think you're more achieved at the fact that you you can see that you did it\""]
["20:32,640","20:35,120","\"It's not cuz it's an achievement on your fucking steam\""]
["20:35,120","20:40,560","\"Yeah, well steam also has something that I like where you can see the percentage of people who got the achievement\""]
["20:40,560","20:41,440","\"I like that a lot\""]
["20:41,440","20:47,040","\"You can see like 0.1 percent people but then half the time those achievements are the exact ones you're talking about\""]
["20:47,040","20:51,080","\"Yeah, it's like kill six trillion enemies using this item and it's like well\""]
["20:51,080","20:56,000","\"3% of the people in the world like this that's like the same as being like like yo\""]
["20:56,000","21:02,740","\"I like I took 15,000 shits like and I feel like we've talked about achievements way too long\""]
["21:02,740","21:08,000","\"It's a good topic. How many people talk about achievements achievement hunter. Yeah, but they're dead. Oh, yeah\""]
["21:08,000","21:11,360","\"They die in a horrible car accident Chris. I didn't want to be remembered of that\""]
["21:11,360","21:14,800","\"Hey, man, that's okay sound they made I\""]
["21:14,800","21:20,120","\"Used to watch achievement hunter and watch some play horse and then they used to do halo fails of the week\""]
["21:20,120","21:22,800","\"Halo that sound I feel like I would have well\""]
["21:22,800","21:26,140","\"I would enjoy that if I knew it existed. I enjoyed it at the time\""]
["21:26,140","21:29,160","\"But now I don't give a shit about halo or achievement hunter\""]
["21:29,160","21:33,900","\"Your life's gone to shit at one point one of those guys was a huge fan of mine\""]
["21:33,900","21:39,380","\"And he asked me to draw a picture of him and I did and then he I think he got buttered and he's stuff\""]
