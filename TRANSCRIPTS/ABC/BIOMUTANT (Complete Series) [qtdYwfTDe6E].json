["08:45,140","08:50,860","\"I feel like I told it on sleepy cabin or some shit, but it's really short. It was basically that when I was growing up\""]
["08:50,860","08:57,200","\"We had a rat that would always climb our bird feeder and eat the food and our bird feeders right at the kitchen window\""]
["08:57,200","09:02,140","\"Where everyone can see it like you pretty much have to look at it while you're reading and so this rat would climb up\""]
["09:02,140","09:05,180","\"It started eating the bird seed and we were like god damn it's a fucking rat again\""]
["09:05,180","09:09,500","\"And we'd like open the window and scream at the rat and he wouldn't even like drop her and he would just look at us\""]
["09:09,500","09:12,240","\"and like kind of look look confused while we screamed at it\""]
["09:12,240","09:17,880","\"So he would just keep eating the bird food and then my mom was like she called her brother Jimmy and she was like\""]
["09:17,880","09:21,860","\"Jimmy can you come over and get rid of this rat for us and my uncle Jimmy was like\""]
["09:21,860","09:25,360","\"Oh, you sure really can marry it and then he came over and he brought a shotgun and\""]
["09:25,360","09:32,120","\"He brought over all my little cousins and we were all just like looking at the window at this fucking rat\""]
["09:32,120","09:35,680","\"Just eating the food and he's just like slowly walking up behind it with a shotgun\""]
["09:35,680","09:38,120","\"And he aimed it at the fucking rat\""]
["09:38,120","09:42,760","\"And then suddenly the entire window just exploded with blood and it was fucking amazing\""]
["09:42,760","09:50,200","\"It was and that's my rat story. I'm surprised like the shot didn't break the window. Yeah, I don't really know how he did that\""]
["09:50,200","09:52,200","\"Maybe it was like some kind of like\""]
["09:52,200","09:57,320","\"Concentrated shot rifle thing. I don't really look like a shotgun. Maybe maybe I'm misremembering\""]
["09:57,320","10:01,760","\"It could have been like a quailing gun or something. I also think it was kind of risky to aim it right like you know\""]
["10:01,760","10:04,080","\"At the rat through the window. I don't know how he did that\""]
["10:04,560","10:10,080","\"Maybe he was aiming down maybe your uncle and I don't want to put thoughts in your head\""]
["10:10,080","10:15,200","\"But maybe he sees in slow motion like maybe he can see like the fucking wings of a bee flap\""]
["10:15,200","10:19,080","\"I definitely remember a little gut sprain on the window that it was funny. That's fucking metal\""]
["10:19,080","10:22,660","\"Not everything is metal. Well, that's just just everything\""]
["10:22,660","10:28,800","\"Explodes and guts go everywhere. It was here long before metal my friend. No, it wasn't my dude\""]
["10:28,800","10:29,600","\"There was no\""]
["10:29,600","10:34,520","\"Metal play a metal. I think metal always existed at least before life\""]
["10:34,520","10:42,240","\"I guess you're right metal existed before metal. It's not just a genre. It's a fucking feeling man and a mineral\""]
["10:42,240","10:45,200","\"Yeah, that's true. Did you watch that show?\""]
["10:45,200","10:48,720","\"Prime\""]
["10:48,720","10:55,200","\"Right, what was it called primal primal? That was it with a caveman. Yeah. Yeah was it good. It's okay\""]
["10:55,200","10:59,220","\"I still need to watch that this is a weird thing to complain about but like\""]
["10:59,220","11:06,080","\"Gendy stuff sometimes it just like it has no fucking like physical consistency\""]
["11:06,080","11:11,000","\"Like like okay. Here's an example. You know what samurai Jack you watch like the newest season\""]
["11:11,000","11:13,500","\"Yeah, you know when she like just like she's there\""]
["11:13,500","11:18,640","\"They're on a cliff and there's like a whole army of guys and she just runs and shoves the whole army off the cliff\""]
["11:18,640","11:22,360","\"Yeah, and you're like oh that's stupid. Yeah, it does that a lot\""]
["11:22,360","11:27,280","\"But but it was still good the animation was cool. There's no dialogue in the entire thing\""]
["11:27,280","11:32,040","\"So it's just like it's just one of those storyboard driven. It's it's okay\""]
["11:32,040","11:36,960","\"So are you having fun with this rodent not in the slightest you love it?\""]
["11:36,960","11:39,720","\"I'll play if you don't want to fucking play\""]

["11:43,080","11:51,480","\"Fun what's wrong with it? I don't know it just feels very generic so far, but you're a literal fucking monster\""]

["11:56,760","12:01,440","\"There's no goal you can for sure shoot that when he picks a goal is to defeat the rockaboom\""]

["12:08,360","12:14,680","\"Remember his I've not even been faced a single moral choice besides going left and right on a path\""]
["12:14,680","12:19,600","\"Which I didn't even know is a moral choice. Well you fucking slice the knees off the rockaboom\""]

["12:42,020","12:48,780","\"But there's just I don't know so not the cut combats very like not control wheel not weird or something. I don't know\""]
["12:48,780","12:56,260","\"It looks like it controls good, but maybe it's fine. There's just something not satisfying about the combat even though that's the main\""]
["12:56,260","12:59,100","\"component of the game to pick it apart\""]
["12:59,100","13:05,420","\"Let's try to everyone loves our dissection. Is he holding a card or make a three-hour dissection video?\""]

["46:27,560","46:32,620","\"Like a good example is like fallout three like Lincoln's repeater and fallout three\""]

["49:20,280","49:24,760","\"Maybe we judge this game too early. I you know what?\""]
["49:25,260","49:32,420","\"I will say about this game. Mm-hmm. I feel like once we're out of the tutorial eight years from now it might get fun\""]

["51:22,660","51:30,480","\"Dude, yeah, toa-wers having so much time enjoy the game while I can before I get dragged into another 15 cut scenes\""]

["51:32,480","51:38,600","\"Why it just always has music like going off. That's true. You know what it does kind of like\""]
["51:38,600","51:43,360","\"Evoke fable sort of in the way that you're like walking around and like digging\""]
["51:43,360","51:47,660","\"You know like people have like those like patches of dirt that you're digging fucking I\""]
["51:47,660","51:50,160","\"Don't know I\""]
["51:50,160","51:53,660","\"Think this game would benefit from just not having music all the fucking time\""]
["51:53,660","52:00,380","\"You know breath of the wild was really minimalist with how it used music and I think that that was\""]
["52:00,380","52:07,680","\"Ultimately a good call. Yeah, I heard that I heard other people were annoyed with it because it's like not as bomb-by-a-stick as the other games\""]
["52:07,680","52:10,380","\"He says yeah, it's definitely like\""]
["52:10,380","52:13,920","\"It's definitely like got a lot of restraint\""]
["52:14,940","52:18,180","\"For a game like it is, but I heard they didn't do enough of the\""]
["52:18,180","52:22,320","\"Minimalist music so it got really repetitive hearing the same little piano bets\""]
["52:22,320","52:29,360","\"I never got tired of it. That was a very like relaxing game like at the end of a the end of a long day\""]

["53:05,700","53:09,600","\"I originally put this at the beginning of the game and everyone told them it was boring\""]
["53:11,100","53:15,780","\"Doing anything about that they just pushed it slightly further back into the game. Yeah\""]
["53:15,780","53:20,660","\"This game definitely does seem like it has two tutorials\""]
