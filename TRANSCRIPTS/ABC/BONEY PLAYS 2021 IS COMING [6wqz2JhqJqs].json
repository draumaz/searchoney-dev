["00:06,400","00:10,380","\"No, I'm sorry if I frightened you with that. It's just your old lovable pal Lyle!\""]
["00:10,380","00:15,240","\"I was just practicing my spooky scary voice for BoneyPlays 2021!\""]
["00:15,240","00:19,640","\"It's coming October 19th again for 13 days of spooky videos!\""]
["00:19,640","00:22,540","\"So I was just getting ready to make sure I'll be prepared.\""]
["00:22,540","00:28,560","\"Speaking of being prepared, you can get prepared for BoneyPlays 2021\""]
["00:28,560","00:32,640","\"by purchasing some of our limited edition merch from our store.\""]
["00:32,640","00:33,840","\"That was a hell of a segue.\""]
["00:33,840","00:35,480","\"This is a really good script.\""]
["00:35,480","00:37,640","\"We got four shirt designs this year,\""]
["00:37,640","00:40,440","\"including this one with a hidden glow in the dark image.\""]
["00:40,440","00:43,440","\"We also have six bony plays themed play mats\""]
["00:43,440","00:46,400","\"for card games and laptops and stuff.\""]
["00:46,400","00:47,880","\"I'm gonna level with you.\""]
["00:47,880","00:49,280","\"I have no idea what these are for,\""]
["00:49,280","00:51,000","\"but I do know you guys wanted them.\""]
["00:51,000","00:52,120","\"So here they are.\""]
["00:52,120","00:54,520","\"These are limited edition and will only be around\""]
["00:54,520","00:55,880","\"until September 30th.\""]
["00:55,880","00:58,520","\"So grab them before they disappear into the bow.\""]
["00:58,520","00:59,920","\"Did I get you again? Maybe?\""]
["00:59,920","01:00,920","\"Eh, needs to work.\""]
["01:00,920","01:07,820","\"We also have a new large four pin set of all your favorite bony boys ready to survive some sort of apocalypse!\""]
["01:07,820","01:09,820","\"I mean, you know, Black Friday's coming up.\""]
["01:09,820","01:13,520","\"You wanna get a PS5? You're gonna have to fucking kill for it, aren't ya?\""]
["01:13,520","01:17,520","\"Anywho, these are limited edition and limited stocks, so get 'em before they're gone.\""]
["01:17,520","01:23,020","\"Speaking of stock, we finally have the talking Zack and Oni plushies in stock and ready for purchases.\""]
["01:23,020","01:28,420","\"I guess this isn't really that scary unless you factor in how, uh, scary long these took to get to a place\""]
["01:28,420","01:31,780","\"from overseas manufacturers due to COVID shipping delays.\""]
["01:31,780","01:32,780","\"Too real?\""]
["01:32,780","01:36,100","\"Whatever, they're available now and once they sell out,\""]
["01:36,100","01:37,380","\"they won't be restocked this year.\""]
["01:37,380","01:38,900","\"So grab 'em before they're gone.\""]
["01:38,900","01:39,980","\"All right, that's it for me.\""]
["01:39,980","01:42,780","\"I'm gonna go scare Tomar with some fake IRS notices\""]
["01:42,780","01:45,340","\"saying he hasn't paid his taxes in the last 10 years.\""]
["01:45,340","01:46,660","\"Oh, that should get him good.\""]
["01:46,660","01:49,780","\"I'll see you guys October 19th for Boney Plays, all right?\""]
["01:49,780","01:51,140","\"Cool, bye.\""]
