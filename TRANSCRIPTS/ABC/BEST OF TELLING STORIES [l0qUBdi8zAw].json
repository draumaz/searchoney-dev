["06:34,000","06:34,840","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:34,840","06:38,200","\"- Even though it was an average size tip, it wasn't a problem.\""]
["06:38,200","06:42,460","\"I'm not a turd about that kind of thing,\""]
["06:42,460","06:43,740","\"and I was even willing to give him more,\""]
["06:43,740","06:46,680","\"but as soon as he closes the door, I open pizza box\""]
["06:46,680","06:48,440","\"and he fucking threw the pizza box.\""]
["06:48,440","06:50,840","\"- Oh yeah, it was fucking mangled.\""]
["06:50,840","06:53,700","\"- Typically, if they make small mistakes with orders,\""]
["06:53,700","06:56,060","\"I don't call him a complaint or anything.\""]
["06:56,060","06:57,340","\"I don't tell them like--\""]
["06:57,340","06:59,580","\"- But it was literally just a pile.\""]
["06:59,580","07:01,200","\"It was completely inadequate.\""]
["07:01,200","07:02,940","\"- It was like somebody stuck a fucking egg beater\""]
["07:02,940","07:04,580","\"into a pizza box.\""]
["07:04,580","07:06,540","\"- And that's what you get.\""]
["07:06,540","07:09,540","\"- I felt bad about doing it,\""]
["07:09,540","07:11,860","\"even though he did fuck the pizza up intentionally.\""]
["07:11,860","07:14,540","\"I ended up just, I contacted Grove Hope,\""]
["07:14,540","07:17,700","\"and I said, \"\"Hey, can we get a refund at least on the pizza?\"\"\""]
["07:17,700","07:20,020","\"Because I sent them a picture,\""]
["07:20,020","07:23,260","\"so he threw it, I don't know what happened,\""]
["07:23,260","07:26,860","\"but it's been ruined and we can't even eat it.\""]
["07:26,860","07:32,900","\"and they contacted me back and said, \"\"Oh yeah, we got you a full refund.\""]
["07:32,900","07:37,500","\"Apparently, he's a new employee and he's already received multiple complaints today.\"\"\""]
["07:37,500","07:42,340","\"So, I got scared then because I'm like, \"\"Is he gonna fucking come back now?\""]
["07:42,340","07:46,700","\"Like, is he gonna get fired and that he's gonna come back because he knows where we've lived or something?\"\"\""]
["07:46,700","07:51,420","\"But I tried to keep that in my memory to never order from there again,\""]
["07:51,420","07:56,780","\"but that night when we were recording Pikmin, we ordered from there because I wasn't paying attention.\""]
["07:56,780","08:03,500","\"ordered pizza from there and I was about to forget that all that happened except he showed up and as he was\""]
["08:03,500","08:09,420","\"handing me the pizza and everything he said put pizza on the floor open pizza and I just said why?\""]
["08:09,420","08:12,620","\"Check the pizza for me show me pizza\""]

["08:21,740","08:25,180","\"It's two months later, he kept that in memory.\""]
["08:25,180","08:27,020","\"He remembered us.\""]
["08:27,020","08:28,780","\"And he put me on the spot about it.\""]
["08:28,780","08:30,500","\"He said to open the pizza box to show it to him.\""]
["08:30,500","08:33,020","\"He says, \"\"Yeah, this pizza looks good, right?\""]
["08:33,020","08:34,420","\"Very good pizza.\"\"\""]
["08:34,420","08:39,100","\"And I remember turning to you, Chris,\""]
["08:39,100","08:41,500","\"and saying, \"\"I don't trust this pizza.\"\"\""]
["08:41,500","08:42,340","\"- Yeah, I know.\""]
["08:42,340","08:43,340","\"And I said, \"\"What are you talking about?\""]
["08:43,340","08:45,140","\"You're being paranoid.\"\"\""]
["08:45,140","08:46,420","\"- And what happened, Chris?\""]
["08:46,420","08:49,620","\"- We all ate the pizza, and then I woke up at 6 a.m.\""]
["08:49,620","08:54,980","\"That day I usually wake up at fucking 4 p.m. Like well not all the time, but this week\""]

["09:04,260","09:10,380","\"Sat on the toilet and I was like sitting there in pain and I could hear my body doing this like weird shit\""]
["09:10,380","09:16,380","\"It's like it sounded like a super-soaker blasting like a stream into a bucket of water, but inside my body\""]
["09:19,060","09:24,820","\"Like inside of me and I'm like what the fuck I'm so sorry and I just start spraying fucking pure water out of my ass\""]
["09:24,820","09:27,100","\"I was like oh\""]

["09:32,240","09:38,380","\"You probably got stomach flu. I threw up from it. Oh, maybe really sick. Okay. Do you so what do you think happened?\""]
["09:38,380","09:43,900","\"I have no idea. I don't why do you even I thought you all had diarrhea? What do you put in a pizza?\""]
["09:43,900","09:45,900","\"You had diarrhea, but I always have diarrhea\""]
["09:47,260","09:51,180","\"When do you put in a pizza to make it to make somebody sick? I don't know\""]

["29:43,720","29:49,140","\"It's just uncanny when a doll blinks and you don't do anything. Yeah, yeah idea that is scary\""]
["29:49,140","29:52,700","\"Like I remember one time I was grounded and I was in my room\""]
["29:52,700","29:57,620","\"Mmm, and there was my sister's doll was on a chair and I was looking at it and the whole time\""]

["30:39,840","30:43,020","\"No, he's saying he thinks it was like an illusion\""]
["30:43,020","30:51,180","\"Because it's one of those things where it's like it's happened before where I was laying in bed like recently a neighbor died at my mom's house\""]
["30:51,180","30:54,180","\"Yeah, and I was thinking one another doll no no no\""]
["30:54,180","30:56,900","\"He used to walk by our house all the time\""]
["30:56,900","31:00,420","\"So I would be used to seeing a shadow when he come by to like in the lawnmower\""]
["31:00,420","31:08,000","\"And he did that like constantly so he died a day before he usually got the lawn mower\""]
["31:08,000","31:11,660","\"Oh, so the next day when I was asleep at night\""]
["31:11,660","31:14,300","\"I remember what a shadow look like I was like man\""]

["32:00,220","32:04,760","\"Like raincoats and shit really give off weird illusion because when you stand my room in the main\""]
["32:04,760","32:08,160","\"Like for entrance when you come into like my mom's house my room\""]
["32:08,160","32:12,020","\"I'd be right there and there was a coat rack. You just do put a walk it in his pocket\""]
["32:12,020","32:18,680","\"No, but when I'm sorry when I was younger that she was gonna happen to me too where my grandma had this weird\""]

["32:31,740","32:37,700","\"Yeah, but at night like it's cuz shadows any kind of shadow that's like moving creates like the illusion that it's like it's\""]
["32:37,700","32:43,580","\"Your brain that's why when people say like I saw shadows at night when I was in a place alone with no one else\""]
