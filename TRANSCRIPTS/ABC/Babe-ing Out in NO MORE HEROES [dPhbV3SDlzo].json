["08:42,240","08:48,000","\"As much as I love them, I think that they didn't really understand the premise of Norbit because they didn't even know that\""]
["08:48,000","08:51,840","\"They didn't even know that Eddie Murphy was also the fat lady\""]
["08:51,840","08:56,000","\"I've literally never seen Norbit, but I knew it was about Eddie Murphy being a really fat woman\""]
["08:56,000","09:00,560","\"Yeah, Eddie Murphy is a fat woman and he's a skinny man Chris Chris quick. You gotta go kill the target\""]
["09:00,560","09:02,720","\"Eddie's a clump both Norbit's already\""]
["09:02,720","09:06,720","\"Oh, no\""]
["09:06,720","09:10,880","\"You're really determined to kill everybody but the guy you're supposed to be killing\""]
["09:10,880","09:14,000","\"Just kill them. Oh, there's a timer. Yeah\""]
["09:14,000","09:18,920","\"I can show you my norbit\""]
["09:18,920","09:24,520","\"But my little Norbit I've actually never seen Norbit you guys seen that no I haven't seen it either\""]
["09:24,520","09:30,560","\"I remember I saw the trailer and I said that looks like it might ruin all other media for me if I see it\""]
["09:30,560","09:34,200","\"It'll be too good. Yeah, that's that's also what I said. Oh\""]
["09:34,200","09:38,320","\"We're cut from the same loincloth exactly I\""]
["09:39,600","09:44,840","\"Don't I don't like what Norbit will do to me sexually. I don't like what it'll do for my standards\""]
["09:44,840","09:50,120","\"It'll make you physically repulsive. I think Norbit would change me\""]
["09:50,120","09:52,800","\"For the better. I don't know\""]
["09:52,800","09:55,600","\"Let's just pray we never find\""]
["09:55,600","10:03,360","\"Okay, I'm glad to know that even when you know how to play this fucking game that still happens to you\""]
["10:03,360","10:07,080","\"No that guy that's why I don't like motion control shit doesn't work like\""]
["10:07,440","10:13,760","\"One third of the time. It's really fucking annoying. Oh, it works pretty well like I've got a fucking\""]
["10:13,760","10:18,200","\"Oculus yeah, and it works like a hundred percent of the time on that\""]
["10:18,200","10:21,960","\"Yeah, so like what those games are designed around it better\""]
["10:21,960","10:27,680","\"What if they tapped into for those that they didn't hear just the Wii remotes weren't that great like yeah\""]
["10:27,680","10:32,520","\"Yeah, no the Wii was just like whatever and then they had the Wii Plus and it was slightly better\""]
["10:32,520","10:36,300","\"We plus is actually a lot better. Yeah, but we're playing on the switch right\""]
["10:36,300","10:39,440","\"But should be a lot lot better, right?\""]
["10:39,440","10:41,440","\"But this game is like programmed\""]
["10:41,440","10:46,140","\"For we so it's using that style of shit. Maybe they should have made it better\""]
["10:46,140","10:48,880","\"The budget studio guys come on\""]
["10:48,880","10:52,960","\"You keep saying that but you won't prove it\""]
["10:52,960","10:58,320","\"Literally look at the soul game. I think it's I think it looks good for the time. I think yeah\""]
["10:58,320","11:01,760","\"I mean looks like it came out 2006. Am I wrong? Am I right? You're pretty\""]
["11:01,760","11:05,680","\"You're a man here, right? It's like 2007. Wow. So you can you nailed it\""]
["11:05,680","11:09,480","\"Okay, that's the line between an insult and an accurate assessment\""]
["11:09,480","11:15,800","\"That one year I mean you crossed it was pretty on the spot though\""]
["11:15,800","11:21,640","\"You guys feel sad when people insult stuff by saying it looks like a ps2 game. No, I love the ps2 aesthetic\""]
["11:21,640","11:26,480","\"Yeah, but I feel like when people say like ew, this looks like a ps2 game that makes me feel sad actually\""]
["11:26,480","11:34,100","\"I think the PS1 has the best aesthetic PS2 has second best PS3 it starts getting gross and the PS4 starts getting good again\""]
["11:34,100","11:39,080","\"I would say the PS3 is gross, but I really like the way demon souls look so I think just everyone else did it wrong\""]
["11:39,080","11:41,080","\"But them I think demon souls\""]
["11:41,080","11:46,880","\"Actually looks awful, but the atmosphere and the colors just seem to work for some reason\""]
["11:46,880","11:55,920","\"Like the models themselves really don't look good in that game, but I disagree. No, but I I agree with you slightly\""]
["11:55,920","12:01,640","\"It's that uh, it's one of those things where your brain fills in the blanks because there's less detail\""]
["12:01,640","12:07,400","\"That's fair. Oh my god. I think on a technical level. Yeah, doesn't look great\""]
["12:07,400","12:11,720","\"But I still prefer how it looks over the new one. Okay, the new one has more poly guns\""]
["12:11,720","12:14,900","\"But the designs are ruined. I think if you look at like\""]
["12:14,900","12:21,860","\"Shitty shovelware for the ps2 like that is a really ugly like if you play like mission impossible or something\""]
["12:21,860","12:27,360","\"Yeah, like that is a super ugly era for when stuff was trying to be like here. You look it's real people\""]
["12:27,360","12:32,720","\"Certain things just yeah, it depends on how stylized they are like I think this looks really good\""]
["12:32,720","12:38,060","\"Yeah, this is my favorite aesthetic like the kind of anime ps2 era like Resident Evil 4 love it\""]
["12:38,060","12:44,260","\"Yeah, no this stuff is awesome. I miss this it's always Capcom shit. What is this? This isn't Capcom is it?\""]
["12:44,260","12:47,740","\"No, this is a craft up manufacturer. Okay. I also like old\""]
["12:48,260","12:52,800","\"Sega arcade shit. Yeah, that stuff is very very looks beautiful\""]
["12:52,800","12:59,700","\"Yeah, I like good sprite art good that that I think is aged better than most like 3d graphics have\""]
["12:59,700","13:02,380","\"Everyone loves some good sprite art\""]
["13:02,380","13:09,460","\"Who doesn't I'll kick their ass exactly. Thank you. I'll I like how a biscuit one looked\""]
["13:09,460","13:15,860","\"Ape's even looks so fucking good. Yeah, literally so so so good or I'm gonna take a quick shit\""]
["13:17,540","13:19,540","\"A/C/A1 has also been awesome.\""]

["24:52,180","24:56,800","\"So it's all single player, but it's somebody else who's playing a different campaign is that character\""]
["24:56,800","25:02,480","\"Wow, that just seems like a lot of work to include that and then not include like actual co-op\""]
