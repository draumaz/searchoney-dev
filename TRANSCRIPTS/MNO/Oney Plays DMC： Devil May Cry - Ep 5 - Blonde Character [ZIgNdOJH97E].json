["00:33,120","00:38,600","\"Vane, would you slip a girl a pill in a drink that turns their blood into concrete?\""]
["00:38,600","00:40,400","\"That's pretty fine.\""]
["00:40,400","00:43,200","\"Yeah, no, probably not.\""]
["00:43,200","00:46,080","\"I would be scared to be in possession of such a pill.\""]
["00:46,080","00:48,560","\"That's a pretty cool pill, honestly.\""]
["00:48,560","00:49,560","\"It is.\""]
["00:49,560","00:53,680","\"I would give anything in the whole wide world to look just like Dante.\""]

["01:28,920","01:32,000","\"I did play the original pve for tonight when it first came out\""]
["01:32,000","01:35,700","\"I remember you talking about yeah, and I got bored of it after like four days\""]
["01:35,700","01:42,560","\"Oh fuck, isn't that really fucking weird to think about yeah that that random ass like lame game\""]
["01:42,560","01:46,040","\"I was playing became the most popular game among like eight year olds\""]
["01:46,040","01:49,800","\"You were ahead of the time of eight year olds\""]
["01:51,040","01:57,440","\"You were technically the first eight-year-old. I think all we have to do to trend chase or to get ahead of trends is just see what\""]
["01:57,440","02:00,320","\"Tomar is doing and then four months later start doing it\""]
["02:00,320","02:07,600","\"It's true. I'd be a trendsetter if I wasn't already so fucking over it by the time it became a trend, right?\""]
["02:07,600","02:13,360","\"Yeah, exactly. That's your problem is that you're so ahead of the curve that you you're behind it again\""]
["02:13,360","02:16,400","\"So we're here's something I don't get\""]
["02:16,400","02:20,020","\"You saw those fucking stupid blonde characters in Fortnite\""]

["02:27,320","02:31,600","\"I hate that blonde character in Fortnite. He's like the fucking worst thing I've ever seen\""]
["02:31,600","02:34,560","\"What are you talking about blonde characters?\""]
["02:34,560","02:37,600","\"Even as someone who has played the game at some point\""]

["02:43,040","02:46,640","\"I literally everything about that game was completely unmemorable\""]
["02:47,920","02:52,640","\"It's the blonde character. He's he's there when you turn it on that fucking idiot with it stupid\""]
["02:52,640","02:57,980","\"He literally looks like he's going hmm. There's no blonde character Chris everyone\""]

["03:18,400","03:24,560","\"Like I believe you I literally cannot remember a single character from Fortnite\""]
["03:24,560","03:32,460","\"I'm not just saying that to be cool and edgy even though it is pretty cool and edgy did I ever show you that?\""]
["03:32,460","03:35,040","\"magazine clipping of people\""]
["03:35,040","03:41,280","\"Making funny Fortnite jokes, but they call it fart night and each joke is a fart joke based in Fortnite\""]
["03:42,000","03:48,360","\"Is it made ironically or no? It's real. It's that's like a really bad like new grounds collab\""]
