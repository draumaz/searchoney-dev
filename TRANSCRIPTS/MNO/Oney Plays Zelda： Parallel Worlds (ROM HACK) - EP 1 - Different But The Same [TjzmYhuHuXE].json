["00:59,500","01:03,820","\"The plan is to sneak into the guardhouse tonight, rescue someone from the guardhouse prison.\""]
["01:03,820","01:10,220","\"Foil Dragoer's plans. There is so much going on it's impossible to fall asleep.\""]

["01:28,780","01:34,200","\"Stuff's gonna be different. I'm really I'm kind of excited. They worked on this for 13 years\""]
["01:34,200","01:37,420","\"So far all they did was the text edit and a hair swap\""]
["01:37,420","01:42,620","\"Don't matter like nothing's different so far. They just changed the text. Let's find out\""]
["01:42,620","01:46,000","\"Let's find out say that is it a stormy night outside?\""]
["01:46,000","01:54,180","\"Mmm. Oh wait. Look at that. This is different. Is it is it? Yeah, we were way closer in the original\""]
["01:54,180","01:57,480","\"Yeah, like that's the desert temple. Isn't it? That's normally in the bottom left\""]
["01:57,480","02:04,400","\"You think it's completely different. You're right. Okay. Holy shit. So in this game, we're fighting Dragor not not Ganondor\""]
["02:04,400","02:10,160","\"Yeah, you're just being told to infiltrate the guard house. I oh wait that cave. What about that cave? Okay?\""]
["02:10,160","02:12,360","\"I guess we'll explore this cave here. We go. Oh\""]
["02:12,360","02:20,240","\"Yeah, that's really interesting. This is an exit cave. Well done, make you know when I see a hole. I just want to explore\""]
["02:20,240","02:25,160","\"It's kind of like you're applying something sexual. What no\""]
["02:25,840","02:31,440","\"I'm just talking about the fucking well who's what's that were those guys in the first one everywhere\""]
["02:31,440","02:36,960","\"Yeah, were they like dog people oh they just realized no they were just nights, okay?\""]

["02:39,720","02:47,840","\"They're nice. It's dangerous to walk around by yourself at night kid go back home. Okay. No, it's not happening. I'm an adventurer\""]
["02:47,840","02:54,120","\"You're not gonna stop me. I'm bringing the grass with me. I got stuck in there\""]

["03:34,520","03:40,600","\"So it's weird because this is like it's the same, but it's just slightly different. That's what's neat about rom-hags\""]
["03:40,600","03:42,920","\"It's like it's like having anal sex for the first time\""]
["03:42,920","03:48,600","\"Because normally I'm sticking my dick in something, but then when I get one in my\""]
