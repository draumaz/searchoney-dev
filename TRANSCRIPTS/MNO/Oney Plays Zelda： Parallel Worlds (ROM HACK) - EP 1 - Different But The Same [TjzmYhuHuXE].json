["00:15,900","00:19,700","\"Long long ago on the Eathroom Sky Islands, the Triforce slept.\""]

["00:54,060","00:57,340","\"Dragoer, the Tyrant King. Our adventures.\""]
["00:59,500","01:03,820","\"The plan is to sneak into the guardhouse tonight, rescue someone from the guardhouse prison.\""]
["01:03,820","01:10,220","\"Foil Dragoer's plans. There is so much going on it's impossible to fall asleep.\""]
["01:10,220","01:13,260","\"Dragoer spelled backwards as Ganondorf.\""]

["01:14,220","01:15,340","\"Is it time to go yet?\""]
["01:15,340","01:18,620","\"That's the parallel world, it's a mirror.\""]
["01:18,620","01:22,780","\"Rollbork this is it. This is our chance to infiltrate the guardhouse.\""]
["01:22,780","01:26,780","\"I've marked its position on your map, press X to view the map when you're outside.\""]
["01:26,780","01:28,140","\"I'll meet you there.\""]
["01:28,780","01:34,200","\"Stuff's gonna be different. I'm really I'm kind of excited. They worked on this for 13 years\""]
["01:34,200","01:37,420","\"So far all they did was the text edit and a hair swap\""]
["01:37,420","01:42,620","\"Don't matter like nothing's different so far. They just changed the text. Let's find out\""]
["01:42,620","01:46,000","\"Let's find out say that is it a stormy night outside?\""]
["01:46,000","01:54,180","\"Mmm. Oh wait. Look at that. This is different. Is it is it? Yeah, we were way closer in the original\""]
["01:54,180","01:57,480","\"Yeah, like that's the desert temple. Isn't it? That's normally in the bottom left\""]
["01:57,480","02:04,400","\"You think it's completely different. You're right. Okay. Holy shit. So in this game, we're fighting Dragor not not Ganondor\""]
["02:04,400","02:10,160","\"Yeah, you're just being told to infiltrate the guard house. I oh wait that cave. What about that cave? Okay?\""]
["02:10,160","02:12,360","\"I guess we'll explore this cave here. We go. Oh\""]
["02:12,360","02:20,240","\"Yeah, that's really interesting. This is an exit cave. Well done, make you know when I see a hole. I just want to explore\""]
["02:20,240","02:25,160","\"It's kind of like you're applying something sexual. What no\""]
["02:25,840","02:31,440","\"I'm just talking about the fucking well who's what's that were those guys in the first one everywhere\""]
["02:31,440","02:36,960","\"Yeah, were they like dog people oh they just realized no they were just nights, okay?\""]
["02:36,960","02:39,720","\"Especially in the light world hello\""]
["02:39,720","02:47,840","\"They're nice. It's dangerous to walk around by yourself at night kid go back home. Okay. No, it's not happening. I'm an adventurer\""]
["02:47,840","02:54,120","\"You're not gonna stop me. I'm bringing the grass with me. I got stuck in there\""]
["02:55,200","02:57,200","\"Music scares me\""]
["02:57,200","03:00,600","\"Hey, he already took the stuff in that chest\""]
["03:00,600","03:04,560","\"What did he say what did you do the church?\""]
["03:04,560","03:08,440","\"The music's legitimately terrifying\""]
["03:08,440","03:11,880","\"Why do you look like you're always running on oil?\""]
["03:11,880","03:23,200","\"There what a full arc container at the beginning of the fucking game well, you know that encourages me to look around\""]
["03:24,800","03:30,840","\"Damn, this is different. Was this where it was sending you? No, I'm trying to get past these guys to go up here\""]
["03:30,840","03:34,520","\"Oh, I see. But they're like, what? Stick around for a chat. They're kind of losers\""]
["03:34,520","03:40,600","\"So it's weird because this is like it's the same, but it's just slightly different. That's what's neat about rom-hags\""]
["03:40,600","03:42,920","\"It's like it's like having anal sex for the first time\""]
["03:42,920","03:48,600","\"Because normally I'm sticking my dick in something, but then when I get one in my\""]

["04:31,360","04:38,080","\"My god, maybe good at guarding, but he's really bad at keeping his fucking mouth shut. It's dangerous\""]
["04:38,080","04:42,240","\"What another boring night? It's treasure hunter. You probably lost the stories about the quest cared here\""]
["04:42,240","04:46,680","\"What were your followers to the kick our king capture this girl? Well, you know this okay?\""]
