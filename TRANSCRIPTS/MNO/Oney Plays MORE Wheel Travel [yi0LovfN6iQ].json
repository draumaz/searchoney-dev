["14:06,440","14:08,440","\"What oh\""]
["14:08,440","14:11,720","\"So you can't do this mission until you get a better car I\""]
["14:11,720","14:15,940","\"Don't think that's how this shit like it looks like I should be able to pull it\""]

["20:49,800","20:53,920","\"Like he'd played a demo of it once. This game has a curse\""]
["20:53,920","20:59,360","\"It's a curse like you just every time whoever plays you volunteers to improve it is curse. Yeah\""]
["20:59,360","21:05,720","\"Do you think he's dead now? Yeah, it's one person that he is now the moment you downloaded this game he died\""]

["21:11,960","21:17,680","\"He was probably thankful as soon as you bought it you would at least him from his prison. Yeah, he sighed\""]
["21:17,680","21:21,000","\"For his murder. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea like\""]
["21:21,000","21:26,740","\"Like when when you play it, you can't help but want to make it more of it. Yeah, and then the last person is free\""]
["21:26,740","21:30,300","\"Yeah, why did none of the houses of doors? This is a fucking weird\""]
["21:30,840","21:34,280","\"They either right they either have no door\""]
