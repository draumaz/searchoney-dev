["00:10,960","00:15,200","\">> Look at this optional area over here that you don't need to do, but I'm doing.\""]
["00:15,200","00:18,400","\">> Wow. >> You better pick up that golden sucker.\""]
["00:18,400","00:21,440","\">> You sucker, motherfucker.\""]
["00:21,440","00:23,840","\">> [LAUGH] >> Molly sucker.\""]
["00:23,840","00:25,000","\">> Chainsaw sucker.\""]
["00:25,000","00:28,960","\">> That'd be good Halloween candy.\""]
["00:28,960","00:33,800","\"a chainsaw. Yeah, that one's a good idea. They already had the chainsaw controller for\""]
["00:33,800","00:40,120","\"RE4. That's true. It's like the same thing. Just turn it into a candy. I saw a guy recently\""]
["00:40,120","00:47,120","\"up completing games with a frying pan. People come up with fun ways of doing that. Wasn't\""]
["00:47,120","00:53,760","\"that goldfish that played Street Fighter in one some matches? They had versus goldfish.\""]
["00:53,760","00:58,360","\"They had two goldfish containers and they had inputs like circling them\""]
["00:58,360","01:04,100","\"So wherever the fish was swimming would make it do inputs in the game. I really really really love them when twitch\""]
["01:04,100","01:09,640","\"Beats games with chat input. Yeah, I really like interactive stuff like whatever happened to that\""]
["01:09,640","01:15,800","\"I guess because people stopped caring with the Pokemon thing, but they did dark souls. That was cool. Yeah\""]
["01:15,800","01:17,800","\"No, it's cool. I'm a boss\""]
["01:18,480","01:21,920","\"They beat it Wow really yeah, because they coded this\""]
["01:21,920","01:28,800","\"Unique way of doing it where it freezes the game every like few seconds to vote on inputs. Oh, yeah\""]
["01:28,800","01:33,760","\"That was a fun one\""]
["01:33,760","01:39,360","\"Uh-oh, I want to see a cascade with that\""]
["01:39,360","01:47,480","\"Ape escape is such a good game. I forgot all about it somehow recently because it's like I would say it's one of the best ps1 games period\""]
["01:47,480","01:53,260","\"It's it's my favorite game of all time. It feels so good to play that game all the analog controls. I don't know do it\""]
["01:53,260","01:58,120","\"It's not even gimmick. You're like apes are just a little boring, you know who even who let them escape\""]
["01:58,120","02:00,680","\"Chris think about this way apes with no eyelids. Oh\""]
["02:00,680","02:07,000","\"Now we're talking baby. I'm for anyone who thinks I'm being serious. I love apes more than anything\""]
["02:07,000","02:12,640","\"But ape escape can go to hell. That's all I'm saying. They're not even apes. They're like long well\""]
["02:12,640","02:15,960","\"I guess actually they are yeah, they're they don't have tails. Yeah, they're apes stop\""]
["02:15,960","02:20,960","\"They're skinny little apes. No, I hate a escape. There must be like baby chimps all of them\""]
["02:20,960","02:27,060","\"Yo, this this chainsaw woman. She's not like she's not like any other chainsaw woman\""]
["02:27,060","02:34,640","\"I'm actually really surprised. She doesn't have tit physics. She does. She does barely. It's tasteful. It's not that\""]
["02:34,640","02:41,080","\"Yeah, that's the it's weird. They want to make her a really sexual in this game, but they also don't do it that much\""]
["02:42,120","02:47,060","\"Like it's it's I'm saying in terms of her design it feels kind of downplayed. Yeah\""]
["02:47,060","02:52,120","\"Yeah, I just say rigging you would expect rigging tits in 3d is really fucking hard\""]
["02:52,120","02:54,520","\"It's really hard\""]
["02:54,520","02:56,520","\"because the problem with\""]
["02:56,520","03:01,800","\"Like soft body physics with real-life tits. They don't have moon physics. So what's the point?\""]
["03:01,800","03:06,900","\"No, but like in these games when you clip into a things body, they don't have bones or tissue, right?\""]
["03:06,900","03:09,560","\"They're just a mesh. Yeah, but what if we created?\""]
["03:10,280","03:16,040","\"Adams the video game space. I'm just saying if you apply physics to only a match with nothing underneath it\""]
["03:16,040","03:18,960","\"Caves in on itself so you need to figure out tricks to make it not yeah\""]
["03:18,960","03:24,840","\"It's it's hard just in general rigging is a tedious on its own put that horse out of its misery\""]
["03:24,840","03:26,840","\"Is there a play of dead air life to?\""]
["03:26,840","03:27,440","\"I\""]
["03:27,440","03:31,720","\"Sent Chris the video when he was talking to me about it. Have you ever seen the tip physics and dead air life one?\""]
["03:31,720","03:36,200","\"Yeah, no dude. There was the age age slider you turned down to zero you tits would fly a little\""]
["03:36,200","03:37,480","\"I\""]
["03:37,480","03:44,000","\"Like to when you had stupid options like that. Yeah, by the way, this fight is gonna suck. I'm sorry. Oh, it's the yeah\""]
["03:44,000","03:50,720","\"The spoilers also look you see your face you can it's right in the middle was this game\""]
["03:50,720","03:56,720","\"Band on twitch no wasn't her a new like a sexual game that got banned on twitch\""]
["03:56,720","04:04,920","\"Cagaro that was it what I like is that twitch has a ban list of games that you can open and you can see all these horrific\""]
["04:05,000","04:08,480","\"Titles right there on twitch open for anyone to see really\""]
["04:08,480","04:12,860","\"Because some of them are really bad and it's obvious why they ban them\""]
["04:12,860","04:20,260","\"Wow the one hatred is such a super game, but I get why it's banned, but at the same time. It's a really tame game\""]
["04:20,260","04:22,260","\"I'm surprised it has the ao rating\""]
["04:22,260","04:25,960","\"Well, you can do way worse than GTA. Oh, yeah\""]
["04:25,960","04:32,960","\"Well, the thing is it's like admitting to violence like the protagonist wants to kill people like that game is a fucking boring\""]
["04:32,960","04:37,440","\"By the way, it is it's if it was at least like an arcadey shooter or something\""]
["04:37,440","04:41,040","\"Maybe they could give them some excuse doesn't the new the world or something at the end? Yeah\""]
["04:41,040","04:43,840","\"Do you know what the code is he has to put in six six six six six six?\""]
["04:43,840","04:45,840","\"You're too pooping you know it\""]
["04:45,840","04:51,840","\"I play that game day one and I beat it cuz I was curious hatred. Yeah, that's all right\""]
["04:51,840","04:58,080","\"The colors have gotten really shit. What happened because it's supposed to be like a hallucination right now\""]
["04:58,080","05:00,240","\"Kill the mushroom. Yeah, it's a nightmare world\""]
["05:00,240","05:03,080","\"This thing looks really cool though\""]
["05:03,080","05:09,560","\"That's our chicken machine is that like a chicken machine or something?\""]
["05:09,560","05:18,800","\"I've seen this before fucking chickens a common trope in American cinema chicken machine. That's so cliche\""]
["05:18,800","05:23,040","\"This is good Nick dialogue come up with more\""]
["05:25,680","05:28,160","\"That is a pretty good one Nick say three more times\""]
["05:28,160","05:33,560","\"That's gross, it's dead\""]
["05:33,560","05:41,540","\"I love how I like progressively it sounds like Nick is like tolerating her less and less. I you know what I mean a huge mistake dating you\""]
["05:41,540","05:46,280","\"Chris you have a Denley you might have figured something out with the plot. No\""]
["05:46,280","05:51,960","\"By the end of it he's gonna be like I don't think I like you anymore\""]
["05:53,680","05:55,680","\"That thing was okay\""]
["05:55,680","06:00,480","\"It's gonna be Stockholm syndrome by the end of it. He's gonna be like you have nowhere else to go\""]
["06:00,480","06:05,640","\"You know I'm glad he's doing this again cuz I just get to finish him actually did this a lot faster\""]
["06:05,640","06:09,560","\"Yeah, you can have really bad luck with that. He can choose to just never attack you\""]
["06:09,560","06:14,660","\"Use chainsaw attacks. I can't believe he died by chainsaw on my\""]
["06:14,660","06:22,240","\"Died the way he lived being a giant chicken. I I don't like the way you can see a scary man\""]
["06:22,920","06:25,160","\"That's a woman.\""]
["06:25,160","06:27,320","\"That's how I feel right now.\""]
["06:27,320","06:28,480","\"This again.\""]
["06:28,480","06:30,400","\"- I love this part.\""]
["06:30,400","06:32,880","\"- Do you remember the funny animated gift\""]

["06:34,720","06:37,640","\"- Yeah, it was like a, it was like a penis and an asshole.\""]
["06:37,640","06:38,960","\"- No.\""]
["06:38,960","06:39,800","\"- No.\""]
["06:39,800","06:40,880","\"It was a dancing chicken.\""]
["06:40,880","06:43,080","\"Where are you thinking of?\""]
["06:43,080","06:45,600","\"- It was a funny gift.\""]
["06:45,600","06:46,760","\"What are you talking about?\""]
["06:46,760","06:48,240","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:48,240","06:49,080","\"- What?\""]
["06:49,080","06:51,320","\"- It was a website my uncle made, you know.\""]
["06:51,320","06:53,320","\"I don't know how I saw it, I swear.\""]
["06:53,320","06:56,320","\"- It's just the first time I ever heard this song was Meat Spin.\""]
["06:56,320","06:58,320","\"- That's what we're talking about.\""]
["06:58,320","06:59,320","\"- That's what I mean.\""]
["06:59,320","07:02,320","\"- I mean, that's actually my first exposure to the song.\""]
["07:02,320","07:03,320","\"- Ah.\""]
["07:03,320","07:06,320","\"- Now we can't even subtly allude to it anymore.\""]
["07:06,320","07:08,320","\"It's all out the window.\""]
["07:08,320","07:10,320","\"Great everyone, don't look it up.\""]
["07:10,320","07:11,320","\"- Bye.\""]
["07:11,320","07:14,320","\"- I don't know, like Meat Spin was a great idea and all,\""]
["07:14,320","07:16,320","\"but I feel like it hasn't dated very well.\""]
["07:16,320","07:17,320","\"- Yeah, it's kind of aged.\""]
["07:17,320","07:18,320","\"- They could have done more with it.\""]
["07:18,320","07:20,320","\"- It is aged like milk.\""]
["07:20,320","07:21,660","\"Not that good anymore.\""]
["07:21,660","07:24,480","\"They did the hamster dance too, where was Meat Spin 2?\""]
["07:24,480","07:25,980","\"[LAUGHING]\""]
["07:25,980","07:28,340","\"This is a really, really pointless part of the movie.\""]
["07:28,340","07:28,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:28,840","07:29,340","\"It's just bad.\""]
["07:29,340","07:31,400","\"It's just wasting time.\""]
["07:31,400","07:33,400","\"It's just badding.\""]
["07:33,400","07:35,740","\"The first one's inoffensive because it's very quick.\""]
["07:35,740","07:36,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:36,980","07:39,080","\"I don't mind doing this part.\""]
["07:39,080","07:40,660","\"It doesn't control poorly.\""]
["07:40,660","07:42,340","\"It's very quick.\""]
["07:42,340","07:45,460","\"Well, OK, it's not very quick, but it's inoffensive.\""]
["07:45,460","07:46,620","\"It's kind of--\""]
["07:46,620","07:48,860","\"I guess it's nice running them over, but--\""]
["07:48,860","07:51,340","\"I guess that's kind of nice running things over.\""]
["07:51,340","07:53,100","\"I don't get to do that too often.\""]
["07:53,100","07:54,420","\"- What?\""]
["07:54,420","07:56,260","\"- Do you know who wrote this song?\""]
["07:56,260","07:58,700","\"- A Spinzy McGee.\""]
["07:58,700","08:00,420","\"- No, it was Spinzy Mackenzie.\""]
["08:00,420","08:02,220","\"- Oh, fuck his son.\""]
["08:02,220","08:03,220","\"- You mixed it.\""]
["08:03,220","08:06,780","\"- Even though they have different last names.\""]
["08:06,780","08:07,820","\"- Yeah, but he changed his name\""]
["08:07,820","08:10,020","\"because he didn't want to be associated with his dad anymore.\""]
["08:10,020","08:12,660","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:12,660","08:13,980","\"- There's a lot of history here.\""]
["08:13,980","08:15,300","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:15,300","08:17,100","\"- He probably should have changed the Spinzy part,\""]
["08:17,100","08:21,740","\"but oh my god, I'm so sick of this fucking magic beer.\""]
["08:21,740","08:22,780","\"I turned it off.\""]
["08:22,780","08:26,100","\"- How many kaleidoscopes did you have as a child?\""]
["08:26,100","08:27,220","\"- I had two.\""]
["08:27,220","08:28,220","\"I actually did actually.\""]
["08:28,220","08:31,060","\"- And then I smashed them together and made one.\""]
["08:31,060","08:33,220","\"And I was not allowed to look into it\""]
["08:33,220","08:34,660","\"in case the glass fell on my eyes.\""]
["08:34,660","08:36,080","\"- Mine was special though.\""]
["08:36,080","08:36,920","\"Mine fell from space.\""]
["08:36,920","08:38,300","\"- My mama kissed it.\""]
["08:38,300","08:41,380","\"- My father conditioned it into a toy,\""]
["08:41,380","08:43,540","\"but he knew it was from another world.\""]
["08:43,540","08:44,380","\"- Uh-uh.\""]
["08:44,380","08:46,800","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:46,800","08:51,140","\"That that's why I make it ultra that channel where you do serious reading stories\""]
["08:51,140","08:56,860","\"I have like one one awkward thing that throws in the question if it's serious or not\""]
["08:56,860","09:00,240","\"That's why I have by lazy eye. I'm not gonna lie that creepypast the thing\""]
["09:00,240","09:04,200","\"I did was one of the funnest things ever. It's fun to just make up stuff like that\""]
["09:04,200","09:06,200","\"Yeah on the spot\""]

["13:06,220","13:11,220","\"and they were always like, okay, this is good.\""]
["13:11,220","13:14,820","\"This is a huge childhood memory and routine\""]
["13:14,820","13:16,180","\"where I'd go to my grandma's house\""]
["13:16,180","13:18,700","\"and I would pull her weekly chat\""]
["13:18,700","13:21,460","\"out of her little magazine bin and I'd read Chat.\""]
["13:21,460","13:23,740","\"But basically Chat was four old ladies\""]
["13:23,740","13:25,540","\"and it was written for old ladies,\""]
["13:25,540","13:28,020","\"so you would open a story and it would be like,\""]
["13:28,020","13:29,320","\"shock factor\""]
["13:29,320","13:33,200","\"ten out of ten or shock factor nine point eight out of ten\""]

["13:57,400","13:58,720","\"I just read it then.\""]
["13:58,720","14:01,160","\"'Cause my grandma just loved reading sadistic shit.\""]
["14:01,160","14:04,800","\"Like murder stories and stuff like that.\""]
["14:04,800","14:08,960","\"But they always used the fucking word kappa for cup of tea.\""]

["14:11,120","14:13,360","\"It was always like, I was enjoying a nice kappa\""]

["14:20,920","14:22,360","\"- I'm glad I wrote about it though.\""]
["14:22,360","14:25,480","\"- Every week as a kid I read at least three stories like that.\""]
["14:25,480","14:27,480","\"That's probably why I'm such a fucking idiot\""]
["14:27,480","14:33,580","\"But I'm feeling that intense every time I swear to God that one of them was literally just I fucked my son\""]
["14:33,580","14:40,140","\"And now all my friends hate me. Oh my God like it was a factor ten out of ten ten out of ten was very rare\""]
["14:40,140","14:44,680","\"By the way, and that was the one she's like I have well like me and my boy were never that close\""]
