["00:35,800","00:37,800","\"You think you're effective.\""]
["00:37,800","00:40,800","\"Just because the Emperor had a crush on you\""]
["00:40,800","00:43,800","\"does not mean you can do cool things like these.\""]
["00:43,800","00:46,800","\"Mulan, there is a being who does not exist\""]
["00:46,800","00:49,800","\"and cannot emote but can also emote and does exist.\""]

["00:51,800","00:53,800","\"For fuck's sake, not again.\""]
["00:53,800","00:55,800","\"And what happened to Ping?\""]

["00:56,800","01:01,360","\"He knows he's recognized the pattern at this point\""]
["01:01,360","01:07,340","\"He just runs away and leaves them to die. No. Oh\""]

["01:40,760","01:43,940","\"It's Goku. That's gotta be\""]
["01:43,940","01:50,680","\"He's narrowed it down that shadow the head. That's Doug funny. I can tell the walker\""]
["01:51,560","01:55,900","\"This lincor Doug funny would show up to school wearing an organization jacket\""]
["01:55,900","01:59,440","\"Yeah, I need bringing a bunch of dynamite to I\""]

["02:07,960","02:12,320","\"He's the same person. I would love to see he makes comics about people they hates in real life\""]
["02:12,320","02:18,200","\"Whoever has the rights to Doug should sell it to a guy who just makes dug into a school shooter. Oh my god\""]
["02:18,200","02:20,200","\"I'm pretty sure they would not do that\""]
["02:20,200","02:23,160","\"- They wouldn't do it now. - They wouldn't do it now.\""]
["02:23,160","02:24,040","\"- I'd watch it.\""]
["02:24,040","02:27,480","\"Skeeter's the one bullying him, and the Skeeter would have--\""]
["02:27,480","02:28,960","\"- We just got the-- - No, no, no, no.\""]
["02:28,960","02:30,640","\"- No, not Skeeter, Roger, Roger would bully him.\""]
["02:30,640","02:31,880","\"- And then-- - We got the Nielsen box\""]
["02:31,880","02:33,880","\"ratings in, one person watched.\""]
["02:33,880","02:35,440","\"- That would be a really good story.\""]
["02:35,440","02:37,280","\"- I think everybody would watch that.\""]
["02:37,280","02:38,120","\"- Yeah, everyone would watch that.\""]
["02:38,120","02:39,120","\"- I think everybody would watch\""]
["02:39,120","02:40,520","\"with their mouth kind of wind up.\""]
["02:40,520","02:42,720","\"- I mean, they would not be appreciated.\""]
["02:42,720","02:43,560","\"- Yeah. - Tell me\""]
["02:43,560","02:46,320","\"that this is a bad character arc for both Roger and Doug.\""]
["02:46,320","02:47,320","\"- I'll say it makes sense.\""]
["02:47,320","02:49,280","\"- Doug starts off as the kid daydreaming\""]
["02:49,280","02:50,120","\"and all that shit, right?\""]
["02:50,120","02:54,560","\"putting him in his place exactly no roger's bullying him because Doug deserves to be bullied\""]
["02:54,560","02:59,200","\"right but then he goes too far and now Doug is becoming like a school shooter type and\""]
["02:59,200","03:03,440","\"now roger feels bad so they both go through a character arc where Doug becomes bad and\""]
["03:03,440","03:09,240","\"roger becomes good roger becomes the keyblade wielder roger sees what he's done and then\""]
["03:09,240","03:13,680","\"he stops him and then he says I know what Doug I'm sorry I love you and he gets filled\""]
["03:13,680","03:15,680","\"in Kingdom Hearts forever.\""]
["03:15,680","03:18,680","\"But then Doug killed Patty because you wouldn't fuck her.\""]
["03:18,680","03:20,680","\"What was that?\""]
["03:20,680","03:22,680","\"Come on.\""]
["03:22,680","03:24,680","\"We better get off of the mountain.\""]
["03:24,680","03:25,680","\"We better stop talking about this.\""]
["03:25,680","03:27,680","\"What happens to Mr. Dink?\""]
["03:27,680","03:29,680","\"What part does he play in this old bottle?\""]
["03:29,680","03:32,680","\"He tries protecting the kids, but they all get shot up in one room.\""]
["03:32,680","03:34,680","\"Oh my, so the shooting is successful?\""]
["03:34,680","03:36,680","\"Yeah, of course it is.\""]
["03:36,680","03:37,680","\"It's Doug.\""]
["03:37,680","03:39,680","\"Why would Doug be that capable?\""]
["03:39,680","03:40,680","\"How would he pull it off?\""]
["03:40,680","03:41,680","\"He's good at planning shit.\""]
["03:41,680","03:42,680","\"Stop trying to put him in my party.\""]
["03:42,680","03:43,520","\"- Put it in my party.\""]
["03:43,520","03:46,320","\"- When has Doug ever been good at planning anything?\""]
["03:46,320","03:47,320","\"Everything I swear is out of him.\""]
["03:47,320","03:49,360","\"- I swear everything blows up in his face.\""]
["03:49,360","03:51,400","\"- Didn't you see him in the movie?\""]
["03:51,400","03:53,560","\"- He plants stuff like an army general.\""]
["03:53,560","03:56,720","\"- There was an episode where he gets a letter from the school\""]
["03:56,720","03:59,160","\"and he thinks it's a letter about how he failed a test\""]
["03:59,160","04:00,440","\"and he's gonna get in trouble.\""]
["04:00,440","04:02,400","\"So he spends the whole episode trying to open it\""]
["04:02,400","04:04,360","\"without leaving like any evidence.\""]
["04:04,360","04:06,880","\"And he ends up lighting the whole house on fire.\""]
["04:06,880","04:09,040","\"As parents come home, they finally open the letter\""]
["04:09,040","04:10,760","\"and it's exactly what he was worried about\""]
["04:10,760","04:12,080","\"and there's no lesson learned.\""]
["04:12,080","04:15,160","\"like it just kind of wraps up with him getting tutored by Patty.\""]
["04:15,160","04:19,160","\"I don't remember him ever being good at planning anything.\""]
["04:19,160","04:20,560","\"- Didn't he also burn down Patty's house?\""]
["04:20,560","04:21,440","\"- He burned down Patty.\""]
["04:21,440","04:23,400","\"- No, he threw a rocket Patty's old house\""]
["04:23,400","04:24,640","\"and knocked it down and then she said,\""]
["04:24,640","04:26,200","\"\"\"Doug, funny, you're horrible.\"\"\""]
["04:26,200","04:27,040","\"- There she is.\""]
["04:27,040","04:28,720","\"(laughs)\""]
["04:28,720","04:32,440","\"- What the, you burned my parents, but I love you.\""]
["04:32,440","04:36,200","\"- I'm sorry for giving them fourth degree burns\""]
["04:36,200","04:37,040","\"on their heads.\""]
["04:37,040","04:39,040","\"- He's very mad at this cloaked man.\""]
["04:39,040","04:41,920","\"- That would be if he broke into my fucking,\""]
["04:41,920","04:45,040","\"house my big red house\""]
["04:45,040","04:46,720","\"the famous big red house\""]

["05:00,840","05:02,600","\"all\""]
["05:02,600","05:03,440","\"that's sad\""]
["05:03,440","05:06,840","\"that's not what she has to be skinny\""]
["05:06,840","05:08,840","\"*laughing*\""]
["05:08,840","05:11,920","\"That's the scouse\""]
["05:11,920","05:19,100","\"It's because it's it's it's by rhyming it makes it sound like it's meant to be really like endearing\""]
["05:19,100","05:24,020","\"Too bad such an insulting look man exactly\""]
["05:24,020","05:29,660","\"Tell the viewers how mad I looked when you walked in the door today\""]
["05:29,660","05:36,360","\"You were pretty angry because your cat was pooping everywhere still yeah, and and then you start to clean it up\""]
["05:36,360","05:37,360","\"to set an example.\""]
["05:37,360","05:38,360","\"*laughs*\""]
["05:38,360","05:40,360","\"He's sweating some shit on the cat.\""]
["05:40,360","05:41,360","\"That doesn't make any sense.\""]
["05:41,360","05:42,360","\"How is that setting an example?\""]
["05:42,360","05:44,360","\"He started pooping in the litter box to go, \"\"See?\""]
["05:44,360","05:46,960","\"You don't like it when I poop in places I'm not supposed to.\"\"\""]
["05:46,960","05:50,000","\"You didn't even tell him that I stepped in shit right when you walked in the door.\""]
["05:50,000","05:51,000","\"Oh, did you?\""]
["05:51,000","05:52,000","\"Was it right as we were walking in?\""]
["05:52,000","05:54,000","\"I thought you were cleaning it off my foot.\""]
["05:54,000","05:57,760","\"I was cleaning it off my foot in the bathtub when you walked in.\""]
["05:57,760","06:01,400","\"He slid across the floor into the bathroom and then there was a whole collection of shit\""]
["06:01,400","06:02,400","\"that he knocked over.\""]
["06:02,400","06:04,520","\"I am sorry that this happened to you, Chris.\""]
["06:04,520","06:05,520","\"It's okay.\""]
["06:05,520","06:13,520","\"It makes for a funny thing to talk about maybe. I hope the cat's okay. I took him to the vet like a week ago. He's just being an asshole.\""]
["06:13,520","06:19,520","\"By the way, I took him to the vet and it costs two grand and they're like, yeah, he's fine.\""]
["06:19,520","06:28,520","\"Doctors tell you you're fine. Don't you love? It's really frustrating. Spending two grand just to be like, oh, you wasted all of your time and got nothing from it.\""]
["06:28,520","06:34,520","\"Have I told the story about getting my nuts checked when I was in Canada?\""]
["06:34,520","06:36,520","\"Canada no, I guess they chopped off\""]
["06:36,520","06:44,440","\"I'm glad that never happened. No, it was they do that up there. You know I was I was having really intense pain in my\""]

["07:03,380","07:06,500","\"I love it. Shouldn't have others.\""]
["07:06,500","07:12,780","\"Did you see the big guy pushed the little guy a little bit? I didn't have insurance\""]
["07:12,780","07:21,300","\"Like for regular and even then I don't know if they would take it in Canada, so I just had to raise the money myself to\""]
["07:21,300","07:23,460","\"Go get checked out\""]
["07:23,460","07:28,360","\"But anyway after like going there and staying I went to the emergency room because I was in really bad pain\""]
["07:28,360","07:29,940","\"and\""]
["07:29,940","07:31,940","\"they go and I got in and\""]
["07:33,100","07:38,580","\"And then I fell asleep in the waiting room because you know, it's the emergency room you end up waiting there all night\""]
["07:38,580","07:42,180","\"Yeah, and the pain was gone by the time I woke up and so I was like\""]
["07:42,180","07:48,540","\"Sucks that I like I wasted everybody's time and I still got checked out and they were like oh yeah\""]
["07:48,540","07:53,900","\"I feel something and then like they they took me in to do tests and they're just like yeah\""]
["07:53,900","08:00,620","\"No, we don't know what the fuck it is and so I just had to be like okay my nuts hurt it for like three days straight and\""]
["08:01,300","08:06,020","\"And I had to, I forget how much money I had to come up with to cover it.\""]
["08:06,020","08:07,020","\"So that it's worth it.\""]
["08:07,020","08:08,020","\"So that it's a bit of pocket better.\""]
["08:08,020","08:11,780","\"At the same time I could at least say, \"\"At least nothing wrong.\"\"\""]
["08:11,780","08:12,780","\"No, yeah, no!\""]
["08:12,780","08:14,460","\"That's the part that sucks about it.\""]
["08:14,460","08:17,780","\"You feel shitty being like, \"\"Man, I wish there was something wrong with me.\"\"\""]
["08:17,780","08:21,060","\"I'm used to going and then something's way worse than I thought.\""]
["08:21,060","08:25,100","\"Like I remember when I was younger, my parents thought I was faking sick and I was insisting\""]
["08:25,100","08:26,500","\"over and over again I wasn't.\""]
["08:26,500","08:27,500","\"And we finally get looked at it.\""]
["08:27,500","08:31,220","\"And they said to me too, like, \"\"If you're sick, then you're sick.\"\"\""]
["08:31,220","08:37,420","\"That's fine, but if you're not sick, that's it. You're never going to see the doctor again. I remember you told me that\""]
["08:37,420","08:39,420","\"I had to bone. Yeah, yeah\""]
["08:39,420","08:43,220","\"My my lung collapsed when I was fresh out of high school\""]
["08:43,220","08:47,460","\"I didn't know what was wrong I was watching a movie with friends and I was just in pain all the sudden\""]
["08:47,460","08:50,980","\"What does it feel like to have your lung collapse describe it specifically for me?\""]
["08:50,980","08:57,380","\"It was that my throat was in a lot of pain and it was hard to swallow and I suppose because I had like an air bubble or something\""]
["08:57,380","09:03,020","\"of my lung that popped and that ended up like rupturing my throat a little bit or something.\""]
["09:03,020","09:06,180","\"So they were making me swallow stuff and everything to make sure nothing was-\""]
["09:06,180","09:07,940","\"It's very, it sounds very scary.\""]
["09:07,940","09:08,940","\"I'd be terrified.\""]
["09:08,940","09:10,500","\"I was in there for like a week and a half.\""]
["09:10,500","09:13,420","\"It's because I have really bad asthma when I'm younger and you're all hearing it.\""]
["09:13,420","09:17,020","\"I have a lot of allergic reactions to things.\""]
["09:17,020","09:24,500","\"I'm a frail, sickly-nerds being Chris is a, Chris is a, a virile alpha.\""]
["09:24,500","09:26,380","\"Chris was eating asbestos for breakfast.\""]

["09:37,500","09:43,020","\"I was like having weird heart like I would feel one beat every like like 10 minutes\""]
["09:43,020","09:44,940","\"That just felt really really too too much\""]
["09:44,940","09:46,300","\"And I was like shit\""]
["09:46,300","09:49,380","\"This is gonna cost a lot of money and since it's near the end of the year\""]
["09:49,380","09:53,180","\"And I didn't have health insurance this year after wait till January to get it checked out\""]
["09:53,360","10:00,220","\"So I was just like I hope I don't die before that and then uh, but then it just stops. So now I'm like, oh cool\""]
["10:00,220","10:04,820","\"That's the that's the thing you always feel these really intense pains and then it's like okay. Well, it's gone now\""]
["10:04,820","10:09,560","\"Yeah, it wasn't painful. It was just really like well. That's not good. That doesn't feel right\""]
["10:09,560","10:15,120","\"It was a new thing. We're hoping to get checked out soon if I die it will be from a heart attack. I\""]
["10:15,120","10:17,660","\"Mean that is the most common\""]
["10:17,660","10:22,440","\"Way to die, isn't it runs in my family every single person's had a bad heart\""]
["10:22,440","10:29,440","\"Listen to the silent cutscene.\""]
["10:29,440","10:33,440","\"It went quite because they all heard me say that I'm gonna die of a heart attack and they go \"\"chult that.\"\"\""]
["10:33,440","10:36,440","\"They felt bad. They didn't want to make any funny jokes.\""]
["10:36,440","10:42,440","\"I was gonna say, was that cutscene there to be like \"\"oh remember when she was climbing the cave?\"\"\""]
