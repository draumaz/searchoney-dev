["00:05,620","00:10,380","\"Welcome to Marble It Up, the biggest sequel to Crash Bandicoot 2.\""]
["00:10,380","00:11,740","\"That's not what it's a sequel to.\""]
["00:11,740","00:13,140","\"We're here to give everybody what they want.\""]
["00:13,140","00:14,980","\"They've been asking for more Crash Bandicoot.\""]
["00:14,980","00:18,180","\"We're going to play Marble It Up now.\""]
["00:18,180","00:20,220","\"It's not Crash Bandicoot.\""]
["00:20,220","00:21,740","\"That's why I said Marble It Up.\""]
["00:21,740","00:22,300","\"OK.\""]
["00:22,300","00:23,340","\"It's more fun, though.\""]
["00:23,340","00:23,980","\"Let's play.\""]
["00:23,980","00:26,180","\"Marble It Up is in-universe.\""]
["00:26,180","00:29,380","\"The explanation for Marble It Up is that engine is experimenting\""]
["00:29,380","00:34,580","\"with a new system with which to crazy crystal marble\""]
["00:34,580","00:37,180","\"to eradicate that pesky bandi-coot.\""]
["00:37,180","00:38,780","\"Oh, I love these games.\""]
["00:38,780","00:40,860","\"Have we ever played anything like this before?\""]
["00:40,860","00:42,420","\"I don't think so, ever.\""]
["00:42,420","00:43,580","\"Look at that.\""]
["00:43,580","00:45,580","\"I'm already really good at it.\""]
["00:45,580","00:46,940","\"Can you get to the goal?\""]
["00:46,940","00:48,380","\"[CLAPPING]\""]
["00:48,380","00:49,180","\"Yeah!\""]
["00:49,180","00:50,580","\"Wow, good job, Chris.\""]
["00:50,580","00:52,740","\"But can you get to the goal on this one?\""]
["00:52,740","00:54,780","\"Ha ha, just wait and see.\""]
["00:54,780","00:56,420","\"Yo, son of a gee.\""]

["01:07,020","01:09,260","\"Damn it\""]
["01:09,260","01:14,160","\"Okay, wait, this is gonna build up some speed you get it. This is gonna be really yeah. Yeah, I think that'll do it\""]
["01:14,160","01:16,160","\"Yeah, see\""]
["01:16,160","01:19,320","\"You did it good job Chris\""]

["01:24,420","01:26,780","\"I think the original marble thing.\""]
["01:26,780","01:29,340","\"What marble madness?\""]
["01:29,340","01:31,100","\"The Robbie Ron compilation.\""]
["01:31,100","01:31,900","\"Yes.\""]
["01:31,900","01:32,660","\"I really think.\""]
["01:32,660","01:34,340","\"That was marble blast ultra.\""]
["01:34,340","01:35,340","\"I really like.\""]
["01:35,340","01:36,500","\"I mean, it is.\""]
["01:36,500","01:37,700","\"This is a follow-up to it.\""]
["01:37,700","01:39,420","\"I really like jumping into the goal.\""]
["01:39,420","01:41,820","\"It feels really good when your ball gets sucked in.\""]
["01:41,820","01:42,780","\"Yeah, it does.\""]
["01:42,780","01:44,100","\"It's like this one does it too.\""]
["01:44,100","01:45,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:45,300","01:46,740","\"Look at that.\""]
["01:46,740","01:48,100","\"I got a gold medal.\""]
["01:48,100","01:49,020","\"Uh oh.\""]

["01:51,100","01:52,420","\"You got to get the gemer olds.\""]
["01:53,460","01:58,180","\"The Flemmerolds don't call them that that's very disgusting. Has anybody ever\""]
["01:58,180","02:03,620","\"appreciate that one bit? Has anybody to make it sound more mystical? Did they ever say ephemeral?\""]
["02:03,620","02:09,660","\"Ephemeral like ephemeral to become fully trans you must collect eight of the\""]
["02:09,660","02:14,340","\"Fermeralts you could listen I would that would be fun. It would be fun. Then everyone would be trans\""]
["02:14,340","02:20,260","\"But you have to collect the emeralds. Everyone's trans no one will be. Only one person would wield all the emeralds.\""]
["02:21,220","02:23,220","\"I want to collect all eight of the femoral\""]
["02:23,220","02:29,100","\"How many mystical emeralds do you think exist with different purposes like the femorals?\""]

["02:43,460","02:49,640","\"I forgot about those two ugly fucking days. Yeah, you can summon them with the flaminar old's there a support trophy. I\""]
["02:49,640","02:52,920","\"I would have had a flippin' Earl.\""]
["02:52,920","02:54,640","\"I hated one of their, like not,\""]
["02:54,640","02:57,000","\"'cause it was bad just 'cause he was disgusting to look at.\""]
["02:57,000","02:57,840","\"The one with the braces.\""]
["02:57,840","02:58,680","\"They're called flippin' Earl.\""]
["02:58,680","03:00,040","\"They're supposed to be kinda disgusting.\""]
["03:00,040","03:02,280","\"I know, but I don't wanna look at it.\""]
["03:02,280","03:03,360","\"Shit.\""]
["03:03,360","03:05,400","\"You jumped off this world to get away from them.\""]
["03:05,400","03:07,400","\"Oh wait, it gives you a power up.\""]
["03:07,400","03:08,240","\"Oops.\""]
["03:08,240","03:09,080","\"You're supposed to jump.\""]
["03:09,080","03:10,120","\"See it?\""]
["03:10,120","03:10,960","\"Okay.\""]
["03:10,960","03:11,800","\"That's the Supa jump.\""]
["03:11,800","03:12,640","\"Supa, it's because--\""]
["03:12,640","03:14,080","\"It's too bad they don't say it anymore.\""]
["03:14,080","03:16,040","\"Yeah, that's too bad.\""]
["03:16,040","03:19,160","\"The Switch controller, all of the buttons on it are black.\""]
["03:19,160","03:20,720","\"I have to get used to the layout\""]
["03:20,720","03:22,800","\"'cause Nintendo sometimes wants you to hit a button\""]
["03:22,800","03:24,400","\"I don't expect 'cause the layout.\""]
["03:24,400","03:26,240","\"- We were talking on the car right over here\""]
["03:26,240","03:29,560","\"about how we all really like the GameCube controller.\""]
["03:29,560","03:32,240","\"I like how because the placement of the buttons\""]
["03:32,240","03:33,080","\"is really weird.\""]
["03:33,080","03:37,320","\"I think it helps you better remember which buttons\""]
["03:37,320","03:38,160","\"and where they are.\""]
["03:38,160","03:39,160","\"- Oh!\""]
["03:39,160","03:41,160","\"- I just as the way they're oriented.\""]
["03:41,160","03:42,960","\"- There's this new design thing\""]
["03:42,960","03:46,440","\"where all these companies are not color coding things.\""]
["03:46,440","03:48,080","\"It's driving me fucking crazy.\""]
["03:48,080","03:50,520","\"Like the Switch controller is all black.\""]
["03:50,520","03:52,000","\"- I wouldn't care so much if it's like,\""]
["03:52,000","03:54,760","\"okay, the A button is where you would think it is\""]
["03:54,760","03:56,600","\"compared to every other controller, but it isn't.\""]
["03:56,600","03:59,520","\"Some games mix it up on you and I get confused by that.\""]
["03:59,520","04:00,760","\"- Blender's doing that now too.\""]
["04:00,760","04:03,160","\"They made all of the UI black and gray,\""]
["04:03,160","04:04,240","\"so nothing stands out.\""]
["04:04,240","04:06,200","\"It's hard to find anything.\""]
["04:06,200","04:07,560","\"- Oh shit, big O.\""]
["04:07,560","04:09,320","\"- Chris, I used to slippery.\""]
["04:09,320","04:12,440","\"(grunting)\""]
["04:12,440","04:14,080","\"- Why do you think they have all these road signs\""]
["04:14,080","04:15,280","\"up here in float space?\""]
["04:15,280","04:17,480","\"- I don't know. - Some marbles don't get lost.\""]
["04:17,480","04:19,080","\"I freaking love physics.\""]
["04:19,080","04:20,160","\"(grunts)\""]
["04:20,160","04:22,400","\"You need some speed to make it up the slow.\""]
["04:22,400","04:23,240","\"- I don't need speed.\""]
["04:23,240","04:24,560","\"(laughs)\""]
["04:24,560","04:25,480","\"- Who's shit?\""]
["04:25,480","04:27,480","\"- What's your favorite physics game?\""]
["04:27,480","04:29,640","\"- Um, as a super physics brother.\""]
["04:29,640","04:32,560","\"- As of lately, that overgrowth game with the rabbits.\""]
["04:32,560","04:34,560","\"- Does, oh yeah, you were talking about that, right?\""]
["04:34,560","04:35,680","\"- It's fucking great, yeah.\""]
["04:35,680","04:36,920","\"- Oh, y'all.\""]
["04:36,920","04:37,760","\"- Hey, sorry.\""]
["04:37,760","04:39,640","\"- Do you like the super bumper brothers?\""]
["04:39,640","04:40,480","\"(laughs)\""]
["04:40,480","04:41,320","\"- I'd play that.\""]
["04:41,320","04:42,280","\"- Does World of Goo count?\""]
["04:42,280","04:43,440","\"- Yeah, that counts.\""]
["04:43,440","04:44,280","\"- I really like World of Goo.\""]
["04:44,280","04:46,960","\"- It's more of a puzzle game than a physics sandbox, though.\""]
["04:46,960","04:47,460","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:47,460","04:48,660","\"Whoo!\""]
["04:48,660","04:51,960","\"There's not much you can do to really play with it, like, once you know...\""]
["04:51,960","04:52,960","\"Oh, you son of a...\""]
["04:52,960","04:53,960","\"Son of a snake!\""]
["04:53,960","04:56,760","\"Good structural stuff. It's like, okay, I know how to do this now.\""]
["04:56,760","04:58,260","\"I like games like...\""]
["04:58,260","04:59,960","\"When GTA 4 came out...\""]
["04:59,960","05:00,960","\"That's what I was about to say.\""]
["05:00,960","05:02,960","\"I had the physics like controlling everything.\""]
["05:02,960","05:04,660","\"Yeah, it's so fun.\""]
["05:04,660","05:06,160","\"You could just fuck with things.\""]
["05:06,160","05:09,260","\"And GTA 5 has it too, but it seems like they dumped it down a little bit.\""]
["05:09,260","05:12,560","\"But, um, I just... I like physics and everything.\""]
["05:12,560","05:13,560","\"Whoo!\""]
["05:13,560","05:14,960","\"What about in real life?\""]
["05:14,960","05:16,060","\"It's very fun.\""]
["05:16,060","05:23,140","\"That's why I mastered physics in college. That's why I ragdolled into class every day like a marble. Wow look at this one\""]
["05:23,140","05:27,860","\"I don't like I don't like my marble look doesn't look like a marble you can't\""]
["05:27,860","05:31,220","\"Check out a new one. I don't want I\""]
["05:31,220","05:38,740","\"Don't like this marble, but I'll use it. There's gotta be like an eyeball marble. There is an eyeball marble good. There's a pumpkin marble\""]
["05:39,740","05:41,740","\"Does it have like a single eye?\""]
["05:41,740","05:47,740","\"Yes, if I was gonna design a pumpkin marble I would make it have a single eye. It's a big eyeball. I think\""]
["05:47,740","05:54,940","\"There are a lot of fun marbles in this game. Yeah, well explain to me every less one of okay, uh\""]
["05:54,940","05:57,780","\"there there's\""]
["05:57,780","06:04,180","\"Dip see the marble and he's having a crisis his best friend Tammy won't go out with there's the grand marble\""]
["06:04,180","06:07,540","\"It is the it is the marble the arch Duke of marbles\""]
["06:07,700","06:16,840","\"He's trying to stop all the other marbles. You're not taking this question series. There's marble - it has twice the density of a regular marble\""]
["06:16,840","06:20,200","\"The stage is named after the dual-loudy of marble kind. Oh\""]
["06:20,200","06:22,960","\"No Chris no\""]
["06:22,960","06:26,980","\"What would you do if in back to the future when he walked up to Lorraine and he said turned into a marble?\""]
["06:26,980","06:33,300","\"You are my dank shitty and she said I am your Flynn city and she's just got sick all over him\""]
["06:34,140","06:36,140","\"Like she starts spinning up flam.\""]
["06:36,140","06:37,140","\"- Would that ruin the movie for you?\""]
["06:37,140","06:38,140","\"- No.\""]
["06:38,140","06:39,140","\"- Well, he said you're my density\""]
["06:39,140","06:40,140","\"and then he started gaining weight.\""]
["06:40,140","06:41,140","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:41,140","06:42,140","\"- She was shrinking.\""]

["08:23,700","08:27,920","\"I felt like a ball in that game when I felt great cool the world looks fun. I would like to try it\""]
["08:27,940","08:33,860","\"It's not it's really just the puzzle game though. That's I love puzzle games. That's fine by me. There's no physics\""]

["22:30,580","22:35,840","\"Yeah, I'd say stick around the middle around this portion. I have not I have never driven on a road\""]

["22:57,080","23:03,360","\"What is that from again? That's from this? Yeah, that's not from this game. That's from our blast the previous one\""]

["23:06,480","23:08,960","\"That's cool. Yeah, it is\""]

["23:14,840","23:17,400","\"But they came back and they made a really good follow-up\""]
["23:17,920","23:22,160","\"Was talking about this earlier where you know the way fall at 76 is a huge disaster\""]
["23:22,160","23:26,480","\"And people are like how the fuck does that even happen like how does such a big franchise?\""]
["23:26,480","23:31,100","\"How does that happen and I think the reason is because you know like Todd Howard and shit\""]
["23:31,100","23:35,160","\"He made like a Bolivian and he direct did he direct Skyrim? I don't know\""]
["23:35,160","23:37,360","\"I know he he was the main guy in a Bolivian, right?\""]
["23:37,360","23:40,440","\"these main guys work on the game and they become like\""]
["23:40,440","23:45,760","\"Like legends for working on these big popular games and then they become the head of the company\""]
["23:45,760","23:49,080","\"And then they just don't want to work anymore. They're literally just like I did my thing\""]
["23:49,080","23:52,460","\"I'm fucking done now. It seems like that's an issue with a lot of people\""]
["23:52,460","23:57,080","\"Yeah, that it's like once you've achieved what you think of as success. You're like okay\""]
["23:57,080","24:01,200","\"I'm done like can you imagine working on more than like three games? I think part of it\""]
["24:01,200","24:04,480","\"Christ if we were really oh, I'm glad you didn't die\""]
["24:04,480","24:07,080","\"Oh, if we really want to get into this discussion\""]
["24:07,080","24:14,940","\"There's a lot of things that I could say but like I think part of it is that when you big budget games have like 300 people\""]
["24:14,940","24:22,700","\"Yeah, exactly. It's impossible to like maintain a sense of artistic vision when you're when any idea is being passed between\""]
["24:22,700","24:28,340","\"I mean, we're playing smash and there's like thousands of names in the credits. Yeah, but it really it does seem like\""]
["24:28,340","24:35,780","\"There's like there's there's always one good like really good guy who like does everything right and they direct the project and everyone's like\""]
["24:35,780","24:38,060","\"Wow, it's a fucking amazing, but then they become like\""]
["24:38,060","24:44,340","\"Shot and then they don't want to do it anymore a big mistake of people like that where it's like oh I achieved success\""]
["24:44,340","24:51,140","\"And now everybody knows me for a thing. Yeah, you got to make sure that you don't like you can't forget that you've still got\""]
["24:51,140","24:54,300","\"Stuff to learn even if you were considered really good at one point\""]
["24:54,300","24:54,660","\"Yeah\""]
["24:54,660","24:59,740","\"But it's not just that it's when they become the big guy and they're like I'm a millionaire now living in my mansion\""]
["24:59,740","25:03,540","\"You go do it then those people who come in are usually like not as experienced\""]
["25:03,540","25:08,660","\"Well, yeah, they're not they're also just not gonna know what to do and if the person the person who knows how to do it is not\""]
["25:08,660","25:13,040","\"Doing it in some capacity like direct whether it be direction or something\""]
["25:13,040","25:17,920","\"Yeah, then yeah, it would make if it would make sense if you're just okay executive producer Tim Burton\""]
["25:17,920","25:21,680","\"Yeah, I came to the set a couple days while they were doing a green screen thing\""]
["25:21,680","25:27,520","\"I just wish that the directors on these games would have some kind of like written guide where they're like I did this\""]
["25:27,520","25:31,840","\"I remember doing this for a reason you please make sure this carries out in the future installments\""]
["25:31,840","25:34,520","\"Where you know like the new just cause game has come out\""]
["25:34,520","25:41,560","\"Yeah, it's got like downgrades in certain aspects from the other game and it's like why like well shouldn't the sequel be better in every way\""]
["25:42,280","25:47,780","\"But that idea where you're going also happens with the dead rising the dead rising for was a fucking disaster\""]
["25:47,780","25:51,560","\"That's because they rushed it. I know but it's also because they didn't fucking take any\""]
["25:51,560","25:55,240","\"Well, I was from the original I would say that was the biggest problem\""]
["25:55,240","25:57,560","\"I'm sure that was completely intentional though as well\""]
["25:57,560","26:02,280","\"I know but that's because everything everything right now is like geared towards getting a really wide audience\""]
["26:02,280","26:08,120","\"So if you know if something is too specific you have to move it towards like the original's take off for a reason though\""]
["26:08,440","26:14,000","\"Yeah, yeah, it's true. They do to be fair fall out one and two most people didn't seem that familiar with though\""]
["26:14,000","26:17,400","\"They only knew about it with fallout. Yeah, that's why it's a weird example\""]
["26:17,400","26:23,440","\"That's fair like what 76 is a disaster. There's no way and I would I would say it's mainly because they just also\""]
["26:23,440","26:28,480","\"Didn't really try they looked around at everybody else and what they were doing and they kind of used it that fill in the void\""]
["26:28,480","26:30,960","\"Opposed to releasing like the thing they put time\""]
["26:30,960","26:37,560","\"Juliet Bethesda's always been known though for having like really sloppy out. Oh man Christ. I couldn't see shit\""]
["26:37,560","26:40,560","\"But I also parted when I did that.\""]
["26:40,560","26:42,560","\"- Did it startle you?\""]
["26:42,560","26:45,560","\"- It did, it was a little mouse fart.\""]
["26:45,560","26:47,560","\"- I was afraid to give out warnings.\""]
["26:47,560","26:48,560","\"- I was afraid to give out warnings.\""]
["26:48,560","26:51,560","\"- Thank you for talking with us about game development.\""]
["26:51,560","26:52,560","\"- Oh my God!\""]
["26:52,560","26:54,560","\"- I'd say things are also just changing in general\""]
["26:54,560","26:56,560","\"with the industry because there's such a demand\""]
["26:56,560","26:58,560","\"for more and more being put into games.\""]
["26:58,560","26:59,560","\"- Yeah.\""]
["26:59,560","27:01,560","\"- But then the budgets of these things and the involvement\""]
["27:01,560","27:02,560","\"you have to get behind them.\""]
["27:02,560","27:03,560","\"It's not gonna keep up.\""]
["27:03,560","27:04,560","\"- I just get frustrated.\""]
["27:04,560","27:05,560","\"- You can't keep going like that.\""]
["27:05,560","27:08,560","\"I get frustrated when they take something good and they just like I\""]
["27:08,560","27:14,680","\"Told me I totally did rising is the best example of that where they just had no idea what the fuck they were doing\""]
["27:14,680","27:17,480","\"And I didn't care about the source well that that's the other problem\""]
["27:17,480","27:22,420","\"You would hope there's still some passion, but when you also keep a franchise going for so long you can't keep passion\""]
["27:22,420","27:23,480","\"Yeah\""]
["27:23,480","27:26,160","\"There's a I don't know there's a lot of reasons the stuff can happen\""]
["27:26,160","27:30,360","\"All that just seemed like they flat out didn't care. Yeah wanted money and that was yeah\""]
["27:31,840","27:38,680","\"Same with like red dead redemptions online and GTA 5's online that shit's just terrible the fact that fallout 76 has to run through\""]
["27:38,680","27:43,160","\"Its own client, which also doesn't work by the way and deleted everybody's files during the beta\""]
["27:43,160","27:48,800","\"It's clear. They just didn't want people to get refunds on it and they were hoping people would pay for the beta\""]
["27:48,800","27:51,660","\"And at that point it's like yeah, you're in you paid us the money\""]
["27:51,660","27:59,080","\"Oh, I have I did not play this far into the game. So this is new to me now. Oh, I like this level\""]
["27:59,640","28:03,840","\"Man every stage in this has shortcuts. I like it a lot. Oh you smelly little ball head\""]
["28:03,840","28:10,920","\"There you go, and some of them are actually really good like Chris you figured that out the second stage how they have the rocks to bounce off of\""]
["28:10,920","28:14,360","\"Mmm, that's intentional they have that on every level. They have little things like that\""]
["28:14,360","28:15,520","\"Yeah, I like that kind of stuff\""]
["28:15,520","28:18,020","\"I like extra shit that you can just mess with and figure out\""]
["28:18,020","28:23,400","\"Yeah, so the super jump has a quirk to it that if you use it as soon as you hit jump you get an even bigger jump\""]
["28:23,400","28:24,960","\"so\""]
["28:24,960","28:28,200","\"Like that you can do that to get up there really\""]
["28:28,200","28:31,460","\"So if you ramp off these little sloped walls\""]
["28:31,460","28:40,440","\"See you didn't even get going hide in if you want diamond so I want you to do it\""]
["28:40,440","28:43,800","\"Yeah, you need to be really fast if you want diamond times. Oh my god\""]
["28:43,800","28:46,400","\"I see that wouldn't be it for a diamond time\""]
["28:46,400","28:49,840","\"You'd probably want to do something more like this and just swerve in\""]
["28:49,840","28:52,720","\"Get it\""]
["28:55,960","28:59,760","\"Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh\""]
["28:59,760","29:05,800","\"I was doing so good. I zoned out. I was doing good. It's okay Chris\""]
["29:05,800","29:08,320","\"I like it when you when you zone out playing a game and you're still doing good\""]
["29:08,320","29:13,480","\"That's pretty much all that playing guitar hero is I was just gonna say yeah, that makes me think of like rhythm games\""]
["29:13,480","29:15,480","\"That's why I like rhythm game so much\""]
["29:15,480","29:19,740","\"This is a very fun track. I like this track. It's feels like mini golf. No\""]
["29:19,740","29:22,280","\"You care for\""]
["29:22,280","29:25,560","\"Damn it that actually scared me\""]

["29:45,340","29:51,300","\"Let's talk it. Let's talk about Bob's burgers. No, I don't I haven't watched either. I'm sorry\""]
