["00:01,600","00:03,400","\"On a plane!\""]
["00:03,400","00:04,400","\"*Sigh*\""]
["00:04,400","00:05,600","\"With friends!\""]
["00:05,600","00:08,200","\"I want to catch a shoulder and then we're getting out of the cave, okay?\""]
["00:08,200","00:08,700","\"Okay.\""]
["00:08,700","00:11,200","\"They have a lot of fun Pokemon in this cave, I'm sorry.\""]
["00:11,200","00:12,200","\"Okay!\""]
["00:12,200","00:15,400","\"Like I said, this is my favorite cave at least in the game.\""]
["00:15,400","00:21,200","\"I don't generally like the caves, it's true, but this is if I had to explore one, it would be this.\""]
["00:21,200","00:22,800","\"Here, I'll make it more interesting.\""]
["00:22,800","00:25,100","\"We'll make a new color palette for it. How's that?\""]
["00:25,100","00:26,400","\"We can make the cave more fun.\""]
["00:26,400","00:28,400","\"*Gasp*\""]
["00:28,400","00:29,200","\"Uh...\""]
["00:29,200","00:31,200","\"Julian what's your favorite color?\""]
["00:31,200","00:33,100","\"Perp\""]
["00:33,100","00:38,160","\"Okay, for either purple or a shade of blue that they clearly do not have okay\""]
["00:38,160","00:40,740","\"We use a shade of blue tube because why not okay, what else?\""]
["00:40,740","00:43,600","\"Like green okay like green\""]
["00:43,600","00:48,640","\"Oh my god, wow, it's beautiful. It's on the white make it black. Oh\""]
["00:48,640","00:51,780","\"Wait and the white make it black\""]
["00:51,780","00:58,440","\"Okay, we can do that. That's really awful. You're right. We should probably make this yellow instead make the blue\""]
["00:58,440","01:05,840","\"Red yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Oh my there we go. I can see better at least and maybe if we darken this\""]
["01:05,840","01:09,320","\"Yeah, that's good and make the purple white\""]
["01:09,320","01:12,960","\"There you go. You should maybe green\""]
["01:12,960","01:17,600","\"Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah, that's pretty\""]
["01:17,600","01:23,920","\"Yeah, that's pretty good. Okay, Merry Christmas everyone it's green and red it even screwed up the border. Oh\""]
["01:24,520","01:28,140","\"Oh my god, you're right. I didn't know that it would do that.\""]
["01:28,140","01:29,960","\"Merry Christmas everybody.\""]
["01:29,960","01:34,420","\"He fainted from the new colors.\""]
["01:34,420","01:36,580","\"I think I say from the nuke.\""]
["01:36,580","01:39,580","\"[laughter]\""]
["01:39,580","01:40,340","\"I would faint.\""]
["01:40,340","01:41,900","\"I would look at it.\""]
["01:41,900","01:44,580","\"Oh my god. Now it looks like a sewer.\""]
["01:44,580","01:47,140","\"It's been irradiated.\""]
["01:47,140","01:51,140","\"This actually does look like a nuclear aftermath now.\""]
["01:51,140","01:53,340","\"Yeah, like look at the water. It's true.\""]
["01:53,340","01:57,540","\"Get out of this fucking house. I want shelter. You want to draw a new border? No\""]
["01:57,540","02:04,040","\"Do you want one of the fun ones? Is that dad from dad's home? Here's a it does look like that\""]
["02:04,040","02:11,800","\"Here's cats. It's a movie is it though. Oh, that's nice actually. Oh, I like the bald man\""]
["02:11,800","02:14,680","\"He's my favorite. He's watching this bullshit\""]
["02:14,680","02:18,560","\"Unfortunately, this audience is not going to live to see the end of the day\""]
["02:21,540","02:25,640","\"Imagine if you went to the cinema and then this just started playing this would suck\""]
["02:25,640","02:32,840","\"People be confused and they'd sit there for a while and then slowly trickle out of the theater one by one. I remember when I was younger\""]
["02:32,840","02:34,840","\"I want to see the Emperor's new groove, I think\""]
["02:34,840","02:39,500","\"But they accidentally played the first like 30 minutes of the Disney movie dinosaur\""]
["02:39,500","02:43,540","\"Oh, no, oh my gosh, really yeah, but the opening of a kicked fucking ass\""]
["02:43,540","02:48,000","\"It's because that's like there's no like dialogue and jokes and shit, right?\""]
["02:48,000","02:53,140","\"Yeah, it's just like flying around with photo realistic environments, but where's the love monkey tell me that I don't know\""]
["02:53,140","02:56,960","\"He was a lemur that movie had a really good thing\""]
["02:56,960","03:03,440","\"What was it he wasn't a monkey I remember seeing like toys for it at the time\""]
["03:03,440","03:06,960","\"I had no and I was confused because it's like the people I see dinosaur\""]
["03:06,960","03:09,440","\"That was the movie that was like\""]
["03:09,440","03:17,440","\"Specifically I remember the toys from I think it was McDonald's they yeah big rubber big rubber puppets for your hands\""]
["03:17,440","03:21,440","\"Oh, in Ireland they had little tiny toys that I got the allosaurus from that\""]
["03:21,440","03:28,600","\"I remember I had a land before time VHS and at the beginning they had a pizza hut ad and they were playing with hand puppets for land before time\""]
["03:28,600","03:30,600","\"I'll maybe that's what it was.\""]
["03:30,600","03:32,600","\"So maybe you're thinking of those?\""]
["03:32,600","03:33,600","\"I honestly had it for dinosaur.\""]
["03:33,600","03:35,600","\"I don't know where it came from because my cousins had them.\""]
["03:35,600","03:37,600","\"I didn't have hand puppets for dinosaur.\""]
["03:37,600","03:39,600","\"They're photorealistic.\""]
["03:39,600","03:40,600","\"No, they're there.\""]
["03:40,600","03:41,600","\"That's why I'm saying they were they were rubber.\""]
["03:41,600","03:46,960","\"Well, I mean, you know as realistic as they could get it as realistic as you or me that movie stock\""]
["03:46,960","03:50,560","\"I mean, that's the reputation it has, doesn't it?\""]
["03:50,560","03:51,560","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:51,560","03:52,560","\"I never saw.\""]
["03:52,560","03:53,760","\"It's not good.\""]
["03:53,760","03:55,240","\"I was not very interested.\""]
["03:55,240","03:57,960","\"I love dinosaurs, but...\""]
["03:57,960","03:59,360","\"Do you like a dinosaur?\""]
["03:59,360","04:00,360","\"Never seen it.\""]
["04:00,360","04:01,360","\"It's not real.\""]
["04:01,360","04:02,360","\"I made it up.\""]
["04:02,360","04:03,360","\"Well, okay, thank you.\""]
["04:03,360","04:04,360","\"But have you ever seen it?\""]
["04:04,360","04:05,560","\"Yeah, I've seen it.\""]
["04:05,560","04:06,560","\"Okay.\""]
["04:06,560","04:07,760","\"Wait a second, you're screwing with me now.\""]
["04:07,760","04:08,760","\"I'm not.\""]
["04:08,760","04:09,760","\"Because I made it up and it's...\""]
["04:09,760","04:10,760","\"Oh my god, is it real?\""]
["04:10,760","04:11,760","\"I've seen it.\""]
["04:11,760","04:12,760","\"Is it real?\""]
["04:12,760","04:13,760","\"No.\""]
["04:13,760","04:14,760","\"Oh no!\""]
["04:14,760","04:15,760","\"Now you're screwing with me!\""]
["04:15,760","04:16,760","\"I'm not.\""]
["04:16,760","04:17,260","\"*snorts*\""]
["04:17,260","04:19,360","\"I imagine the real thing.\""]
["04:19,360","04:20,560","\"Are you with nobody? What's going on?\""]
["04:20,560","04:21,560","\"I can imagine the movie.\""]
["04:21,560","04:23,360","\"You're warping my mind. What's happening?\""]
["04:23,360","04:25,560","\"I'm just imagining the DVD box. That's all.\""]
["04:25,560","04:26,560","\"What does it look like?\""]
["04:26,560","04:28,360","\"Really, really brown.\""]
["04:28,360","04:33,960","\"I imagine it's like one of those really cheap illustrations\""]
["04:33,960","04:38,160","\"where they only like vaguely saw what the source material looked like.\""]
["04:38,160","04:39,360","\"No.\""]
["04:39,360","04:40,260","\"Oh.\""]
["04:40,260","04:41,760","\"It's uh, it's the...\""]
["04:41,760","04:43,760","\"Remember the dinosaurs by Jim Henson?\""]
["04:43,760","04:44,260","\"Uh huh.\""]
["04:44,260","04:46,660","\"It's those but photoshopped all to look like\""]
["04:46,660","04:49,800","\"one dinosaur with the features of all of those\""]
["04:49,800","04:55,140","\"those okay and what's the dinosaur about one\""]
["04:55,140","04:59,740","\"dinosaur lost in the real world uh-huh he\""]
["04:59,740","05:02,020","\"he enters New York City through a sewer\""]
["05:02,020","05:06,780","\"and says P.E.L.S.A.T. this is starting\""]
["05:06,780","05:09,380","\"that sound maybe like something else I'm\""]
["05:09,380","05:11,620","\"not quite sure what it sounds like to me\""]
["05:11,620","05:12,940","\"but turn back the clock wait what about\""]
["05:12,940","05:15,060","\"we're back huh whether you like it I\""]
["05:15,060","05:16,180","\"I like the, it's okay.\""]
["05:16,180","05:20,260","\"I mean, it's funny and stupid, but it's not good.\""]
["05:20,260","05:25,100","\"- You don't at least get any enjoyment of bad eyes.\""]
["05:25,100","05:27,820","\"- I do, no, I get enjoyment out of nearly all of it,\""]
["05:27,820","05:31,780","\"but it's like most of it's stupid and cheesy and not good.\""]
["05:31,780","05:34,460","\"- Can you imagine getting chased around the house\""]
["05:34,460","05:35,540","\"by John Goodman?\""]
["05:35,540","05:36,380","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:36,380","05:37,220","\"And he's in a diaper.\""]
["05:37,220","05:40,100","\"- And he's going, roll on back to the door all the time.\""]
["05:40,100","05:41,820","\"- As he's rolling down the hallway.\""]
["05:41,820","05:44,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:44,100","05:44,940","\"-\""]
["05:44,940","05:47,460","\"- I'm like throwing poxies.\""]
["05:47,460","05:49,460","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:49,460","05:52,020","\"- Who's the super Rapuyae?\""]
["05:52,020","05:53,460","\"- The super Rapuyae?\""]
["05:53,460","05:55,980","\"- The super Rapuyae?\""]
["05:55,980","05:57,540","\"- Is that your fighting game move?\""]
["05:57,540","05:59,820","\"- That sounds like a religious figure.\""]
["05:59,820","06:01,060","\"- Super Rapuyae?\""]
["06:01,060","06:03,180","\"- He's using his super Rapuyae.\""]
["06:03,180","06:04,300","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:04,300","06:05,300","\"- I would like that.\""]
["06:05,300","06:10,540","\"(singing in foreign language)\""]
["06:10,540","06:11,900","\"- What's the Boulder town?\""]

["06:21,900","06:23,900","\"GET AWAY FROM ME, PLEASE!\""]
["06:23,900","06:25,900","\"Oh no, I went in a circle like a fool.\""]
["06:25,900","06:27,900","\"Awwwwwwww\""]
["06:27,900","06:28,900","\"Awwww yeah!\""]
["06:28,900","06:30,900","\"That's actually a really cozy little...\""]
["06:30,900","06:32,900","\"I really like the borders of the Super Game Boy.\""]
["06:32,900","06:34,900","\"I'm glad we're getting to show them off a little bit.\""]
["06:34,900","06:35,900","\"You know something?\""]
["06:35,900","06:36,900","\"Tell me, Chris.\""]
["06:36,900","06:37,900","\"Tell me.\""]
["06:37,900","06:38,900","\"No, me instead.\""]
["06:38,900","06:40,900","\"Okay, I'll tell Ding Dong.\""]
["06:40,900","06:46,820","\"Julian's focused on so it's true. I'm sorry Julian. So is ding dongs also playing a game - no both\""]
["06:46,820","06:52,900","\"Play a lot covers ears don't let him hear. Oh, okay, Chris. What do you have to say? I really hope that\""]
["06:52,900","06:57,300","\"Someday I live somewhere where I know deep down\""]
["06:57,300","07:00,820","\"I'll never have to worry about bird glurs\""]
["07:00,820","07:08,260","\"The first time we went up to the grocery store a guy went in there and tried to shoplift it and got surrounded by cop cars as they pulled them out of there\""]
["07:08,500","07:12,740","\"I wonder how many people genuinely worry they're gonna be broken into every night.\""]
["07:12,740","07:18,100","\"I don't know, probably a lot. I mean, it is a scary thing if it happens.\""]
["07:18,100","07:18,900","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:18,900","07:20,980","\"That's why you have a brick ready.\""]
["07:20,980","07:23,380","\"I don't have a brick ready.\""]
["07:23,380","07:25,220","\"Well, you're in danger aren't you?\""]
["07:25,220","07:27,060","\"Fight him, he's evil!\""]
["07:27,060","07:27,460","\"Okay.\""]
["07:27,460","07:29,620","\"I wrote my book.\""]
["07:29,620","07:31,060","\"Oh my god, he is evil.\""]
["07:31,060","07:32,820","\"He stole a bird.\""]
["07:32,820","07:36,740","\"He found a little bird on the ground and made it fly him here.\""]
["07:36,740","07:38,740","\"Oh, not this fucking idiot.\""]
["07:38,740","07:41,980","\"It's the same wine, Chris. He keeps following me everywhere.\""]
["07:41,980","07:47,380","\"I like Firo because he instills fear in children everywhere.\""]
["07:47,380","07:49,380","\"And he has no fear.\""]
["07:49,380","07:50,380","\"Oh.\""]
["07:50,380","07:53,340","\"He's called fear ow.\""]
["07:53,340","07:54,340","\"Ow.\""]
["07:54,340","07:58,820","\"That's because he causes you fear and you slap him really fast.\""]
["07:58,820","07:59,820","\"And then it goes ow.\""]
["07:59,820","08:01,820","\"And he flies away instantly.\""]
["08:03,620","08:08,980","\"Okay, is this gonna be another oh, I've got three of the same thing probably this sucks\""]
["08:08,980","08:18,180","\"Okay, good different good see look he's got fat lump. I like him. I do I guess right and this\""]
["08:18,180","08:23,100","\"So when games when all the Pokemon games start out they usually have\""]
["08:23,100","08:30,660","\"You know they they restrict themselves to probably around like a hundred Pokemon for like the main story of the game\""]
["08:31,060","08:39,440","\"Has there ever been a main line Pokemon game where the pool of Pokemon that trainers can have is just the entire cannon?\""]
["08:39,440","08:42,980","\"Or has it always been restricted?\""]
["08:42,980","08:47,100","\"I think it's always been restricted because that's the whole catch they want you to buy the same game twice\""]
["08:47,100","08:49,260","\"Well, yeah, of course to catch them\""]
["08:49,260","08:54,020","\"But I mean as in like trainers whether trainers could have any Pokemon out of the same\""]
["08:54,020","08:57,860","\"I feel like some of them maybe have done that when there were less Pokemon\""]
["08:57,860","09:03,420","\"But they would show off almost all of them in the game outside of the legendary though. So that's the problem\""]
["09:03,420","09:08,380","\"You're always gonna have this super legendary the legendaries are not used because that's why they're called that, but okay\""]
["09:08,380","09:13,900","\"I feel like they might so that a bug catcher can have like a worm pull a caterpie\""]
["09:13,900","09:22,380","\"What are the other bugs they were saying like all of them overall though or do you mean make all the Pokemon like from every region is\""]
["09:22,380","09:25,060","\"What I'm saying. Oh, okay. I don't know\""]
["09:26,860","09:30,800","\"They could do that now though. They could I just don't know if they ever have I\""]
["09:30,800","09:37,060","\"Figured you were just saying like has there been a game where they showed all the Pokemon that exist within that game\""]
["09:37,060","09:43,640","\"I mean every game has like the full pokey decks in it. Yeah, you can complete but you can't catch all of them is the thing yeah\""]
["09:43,640","09:46,900","\"This game's really fucking long\""]
["09:46,900","09:48,900","\"Which Pokemon red?\""]
["09:48,900","09:54,060","\"Only because there's moments that slow you down a lot specifically any caves always do it I\""]
["09:54,780","09:58,380","\"I'd also say we spent a window kind of like trying to level up everybody.\""]
["09:58,380","09:59,580","\"Yeah, that was nice.\""]
["09:59,580","10:01,180","\"I'll take the blame for that.\""]
["10:01,180","10:03,380","\"There's nothing wrong for doing that.\""]
["10:03,380","10:06,780","\"You wanted to show off more of our Pokemon, but the problem is too, if you want to get through the game,\""]
["10:06,780","10:08,580","\"like at a normal pace, you wouldn't do that.\""]
["10:08,580","10:10,380","\"You probably just rush down one really hard.\""]
["10:10,380","10:14,780","\"That's why I was trying to build up Nidoking at the beginning because you can just plow through everything.\""]
["10:14,780","10:15,780","\"Nidoking.\""]
["10:15,780","10:16,980","\"Nidoking.\""]

["12:30,180","12:31,820","\"- It's genuinely terrifying.\""]
["12:31,820","12:33,780","\"- Well, it's terrifying because this game\""]
["12:33,780","12:35,900","\"is so unstable to begin with,\""]
["12:35,900","12:38,860","\"and then that's something that just destroys everything.\""]
["12:38,860","12:40,820","\"If you wanna warp this game horribly,\""]

["13:07,100","13:12,660","\"But like that that's the kind of kids are gonna say it's also because I remember if you called the Nintendo hotline\""]
["13:12,660","13:16,460","\"They had a thing that they would be like are you calling about the Pokemon missing?\""]
["13:16,460","13:20,780","\"No, really did they really yeah, and if you press the button they would give you an explanation that it was a\""]
["13:20,780","13:25,640","\"Like a glitch in the game and that if you catch it it could damage your save file so you shouldn't do it\""]
["13:25,640","13:33,580","\"Yeah, and like back then at least for me getting a game was a big deal like I would get a new game\""]
