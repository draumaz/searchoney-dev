["05:13,500","05:15,260","\"which I didn't really like by comparison.\""]
["05:15,660","05:19,300","\"The day and night cycle is kind of artificial, but it looks better for it\""]

["05:57,220","06:01,420","\"The smallest things have mascots here's a I hate this lady\""]
["06:01,420","06:04,400","\"Because she causes the entire game to happen how she's a\""]

["06:14,820","06:24,820","\"Look how good it is. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. It's curly tat. They ruined her in all the sequels.\""]
["06:24,820","06:33,820","\"What do they do? They decided that she actually caused things intentionally so she could look like a hero to save the day.\""]
["06:33,820","06:37,820","\"Really? Look at his eyes. They're tiny. No, they're bulging out of his fucking brain.\""]

["07:16,700","07:21,460","\"I think it was a reality show for like diving\""]
["07:21,460","07:24,680","\"So he ended up in the swimming pool. They had to get a bunch of people\""]
["07:24,680","07:28,060","\"I was young. I was young. I don't know they had to fish him out of the pool\""]
["07:28,060","07:32,980","\"There's photos of him like hunched over looking defeated. It couldn't even swim in the pool. I like when that happens\""]
