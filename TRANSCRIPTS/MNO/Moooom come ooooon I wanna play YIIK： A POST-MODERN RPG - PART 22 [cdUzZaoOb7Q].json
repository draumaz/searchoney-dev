["10:26,320","10:28,320","\"I used to scream because you didn't know what was happening.\""]
["10:28,320","10:30,320","\"I was really fucking scared.\""]

["11:07,520","11:10,920","\"It's just annoying that every time you go to the doctor over something\""]
["11:10,920","11:15,160","\"They'll usually be like it's nothing and then that makes you not want to go when there is something\""]
["11:15,160","11:17,400","\"It's true. I\""]
["11:17,400","11:23,320","\"Remember when I was younger my thing was just that a lot of doctors would just refer you to different doctors. Oh, yeah\""]

["11:32,720","11:37,200","\"So yeah, if you want to just do better damage good and you can slow it down once over the yellow\""]
["11:37,200","11:39,200","\"if you want to hit a bunch I\""]
["11:39,200","11:46,460","\"Think this mini games decent. I like the idea no matter what you want to hit the red. Yeah, the red one\""]

["18:34,780","18:39,700","\"The problem is that we're never going to know which one is incorrect\""]
