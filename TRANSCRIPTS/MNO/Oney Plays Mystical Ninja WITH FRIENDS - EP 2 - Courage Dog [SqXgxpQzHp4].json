["03:03,020","03:05,140","\"I like that.\""]
["03:05,140","03:07,900","\"But I don't understand who built it and put it there.\""]
["03:07,900","03:10,100","\"This is the best game I've ever seen.\""]
["03:10,100","03:13,460","\"Something tells me you're fibbing.\""]

["03:18,260","03:19,980","\"The comment section tells me.\""]
["03:19,980","03:22,780","\"The comment section told me that you hate every game.\""]
["03:22,780","03:25,540","\"Why does Chris play games he doesn't like?\""]
["03:25,540","03:28,180","\"How do you know you like them if you're going to play on?\""]

["03:35,740","03:38,820","\"Why do you only play games that I like but you seem to hate?\""]
["03:38,820","03:42,780","\"That's very specific.\""]
["03:43,380","03:45,380","\"Tomb Raider is not bad.\""]
["03:45,380","03:47,380","\"That's the weirdest one.\""]
["03:47,380","03:51,380","\"You're playing it the wrong way by trying to actually do things in it.\""]
["03:51,380","03:56,380","\"You're playing it on normal. You're supposed to play it on this very specific one that it's not set to default.\""]
["03:56,380","03:58,380","\"Is there actually a difficulty setting?\""]
["03:58,380","04:00,380","\"Yeah, there was, and we picked normal.\""]
["04:00,380","04:04,380","\"In conclusion, I like Tomb Raider because she gets killed a lot.\""]
["04:04,380","04:09,380","\"Her hair is very long and pretty, and her hair has real physics.\""]
["04:09,380","04:14,100","\"That's right people are getting mad at Chris for saying that her hair was dirty. I\""]
["04:14,100","04:17,200","\"Forgot about that. It's rude. You don't point that out\""]
["04:17,200","04:23,020","\"She's been through a lot. She's been stabbed and raped and all kinds of things didn't get raped\""]
["04:23,020","04:25,940","\"She almost did that's what they want\""]
["04:25,940","04:29,980","\"She almost did she didn't actually have it happen. I\""]
["04:29,980","04:38,860","\"Mean it was why that she got held down in the woods and you know was never implied well then why does it mean I remember\""]
["04:38,860","04:42,980","\"That being a thing the guy was gonna do it, but he didn't do it\""]
["04:42,980","04:46,620","\"He has second thoughts and he realized it would have been really mean if he did it\""]
["04:46,620","04:49,740","\"It's actually a huge infected hole in her tummy, so he lost his chubber\""]
["04:49,740","04:54,820","\"That would don't make sense. He apologized profusely and then she shot him in the head\""]
["04:54,820","05:00,140","\"He said I would have been watching a lot of videos online, and I realized now that maybe I shouldn't be raping you\""]
["05:00,140","05:02,980","\"And she shot him\""]
["05:02,980","05:07,780","\"And he said I die a hero. I've learned my mistakes my sins are absolved\""]
["05:08,380","05:13,660","\"Why don't put your breath that's what this guy says. Ah, ah, it was my family. Is it no?\""]
["05:13,660","05:16,740","\"They got blue hair\""]
["05:16,740","05:19,460","\"Yeah, blue hair. She got the blue pussy. Oh\""]
["05:19,460","05:24,060","\"You're real\""]
["05:24,060","05:29,020","\"You're real the things I know for love\""]
