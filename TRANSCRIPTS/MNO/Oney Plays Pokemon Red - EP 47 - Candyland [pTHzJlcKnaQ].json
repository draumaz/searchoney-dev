["10:28,280","10:32,920","\"I think just existing his pain and what do you think the inside of a wheezing looks like?\""]
["10:34,200","10:38,840","\"Do you think it's just tubes and like openings like he's outside?\""]
["10:38,840","10:42,440","\"There's probably a lot of acid substances in there.\""]
["10:42,440","10:45,000","\"Or do you think he's got like organs and shit in there?\""]
["10:45,000","10:47,360","\"Ah, I don't know.\""]

["11:20,600","11:24,360","\"Don't mean that it's just fucking mix it up a little bit or not\""]
["11:24,360","11:26,760","\"Just reuse the same shit over and over I can get it though\""]
["11:26,760","11:32,440","\"Just because I played a lot of RPGs like that's the thing that they'll do sometimes you know get kind of lazy without\""]
["11:32,440","11:42,240","\"I structure these. I will say this is a boring trainer encounter though. I wanted\""]
["11:42,240","11:47,520","\"to send out just a little sprite of need probably you know. Why can't he have that?\""]
["11:47,520","11:52,520","\"I tried to exactly so that you would pop out.\""]
["11:52,520","11:54,520","\"(laughing)\""]

["12:13,520","12:15,520","\"- So what are the odds that a Pokemon just happens\""]
["12:15,520","12:18,520","\"Pokemon just happens to look just like a Pokeball, okay?\""]
["12:18,520","12:19,520","\"It's mysterious.\""]
["12:19,520","12:21,520","\"It's like a mimic, Chris.\""]
["12:21,520","12:23,520","\"Yeah? Well, I'm not buying it.\""]
["12:23,520","12:25,520","\"The tree is gone.\""]

["12:28,520","12:30,520","\"Yes, yes please.\""]
["12:30,520","12:35,520","\"Is the Safari Zone the one where you can get locked out of it because you have to pay money?\""]
["12:35,520","12:42,520","\"Yes, you can get stuck here. In yellow version they added a fail safe though that if you ask them ten times when you don't have any money,\""]
["12:42,520","12:45,440","\"You know what will let you in but you only get one safari ball\""]
["12:45,440","12:47,720","\"Cuz they don't they don't want you to get stuck\""]
