["00:05,500","00:08,700","\"Looks like you're running late.\""]

["00:19,300","00:23,000","\"That a ponytail?\""]
["00:23,000","00:28,800","\"Hmm.\""]
["00:28,800","00:30,800","\"Very secure.\""]

["01:10,440","01:19,880","\"Gordon later for what I go down there for spooky\""]
["01:19,880","01:30,520","\"*muffled* That experiment is singin' my best part! *laughs* *laughs* Why didn't your man get more voice actors?\""]
["01:30,520","01:36,000","\"*muffled* Ah yes, oi! Better send it for Mr.\""]
["01:36,000","01:38,920","\"Morning champ. Okay. You pass the test.\""]
["01:38,920","01:42,760","\"You guys are messy as shit.\""]
["01:42,760","01:49,760","\"Has anyone actually even seen your degree? Freeman.\""]
["01:49,760","01:52,760","\"At least it's big.\""]
["01:52,760","01:56,760","\"Ridiculous voice, has?\""]
["01:56,760","02:00,760","\"Maybe you should have hired someone with a less obviously fucking unique voice.\""]
["02:00,760","02:03,760","\"If you're going to use them for every voice in the game.\""]
["02:03,760","02:05,760","\"I mean, this is real life.\""]
["02:05,760","02:07,760","\"I'm Gordon Freeman.\""]
["02:07,760","02:37,480","\"I found the orchard. Oh wow. This music. Oh yeah. Hell yeah. Oh yeah. Oh. Okay, I hear you. The\""]

["03:20,200","03:29,000","\"Oh\""]
["03:33,640","03:37,760","\"Did you catch that last fluctuation my god? It's nothing to worry about\""]
["03:37,760","03:57,520","\"Down procedure charge I'm sure it'll show up sooner or later if I do some wacky experiments down here\""]
["03:57,520","04:02,560","\"Jesus why even bother control\""]
["04:02,560","04:06,840","\"Hey boy!\""]
["04:06,840","04:25,360","\"I'm learning how to use a phone.\""]

["04:50,660","04:57,120","\"Stop standing like Lil Pussy.\""]
["04:57,120","05:02,120","\"105% bit of a gamble, but we needed the extra resolution okay\""]
["05:02,120","05:09,320","\"That we get a conclusive analysis of today's sample. I gather he went to some lengths to get it\""]
["05:09,320","05:13,840","\"They're waiting for you Gordon in the test chamber\""]
["05:13,840","05:18,760","\"Right. Why did you say like that the test chamber?\""]
["05:18,760","05:22,660","\"Like I put it on you it'll fall through I\""]
["05:23,840","05:28,060","\"Put it inside him now. He won't need his daily copy Gordon\""]
["05:28,060","05:32,080","\"These guys don't have physics\""]
["05:32,080","05:39,000","\"Possibly\""]
["05:39,000","05:42,200","\"Greetings Eli\""]
["05:42,200","05:44,680","\"I trust this morning. Oh shit is Eli\""]
["05:44,680","05:51,560","\"Gordon good morning. Hello. I'm glad you're here these last minute changes\""]
["05:52,560","05:57,200","\"They're a bit strange. Jesus. It's about to go critical. Uh\""]
["05:57,200","06:01,360","\"He's probably a bad idea\""]
["06:01,360","06:07,520","\"What in the blazes is going on with our equipment? It's nothing. We can't handle ourselves Eli\""]
["06:07,520","06:10,920","\"You guys are fucking lying. I'm up to you\""]
["06:10,920","06:18,680","\"I skipped it\""]

["06:54,320","07:05,440","\"Hey cool you got a voice\""]
["07:05,440","07:16,640","\"Reason this is a rare opportunity for us. This is the purest sample we've seen yet\""]
["07:17,560","07:24,180","\"Potentially the most unstable now as long as we follow standard insertion procedures everything will be fine\""]
["07:24,180","07:31,740","\"I don't know how you can say that although I will admit that the possibility of a resonance cascade scenario is extremely unlikely\""]
["07:31,740","07:36,820","\"I just don't you don't need to hear all this I need the mumbo-dumbo\""]
["07:36,820","07:41,740","\"I'm a trained professional we were sure the administrator that nothing will go wrong\""]
["07:41,740","07:45,020","\"Yes, you're right\""]

["07:57,440","08:01,780","\"Let me let me do the thing\""]
["08:01,780","08:06,500","\"That's where I need go\""]
["08:06,500","08:08,940","\"testing hello\""]
["08:08,940","08:14,180","\"Everything seems to be an order. I know a kind of ladder come on now I\""]
["08:15,260","08:16,260","\"I say them.\""]
["08:16,260","08:24,260","\"The specimen will be delivered to you in a few moments.\""]
["08:24,260","08:26,260","\"Buttons not working!\""]
["08:26,260","08:30,260","\"But what?\""]
["08:30,260","08:35,260","\"Okay.\""]

["08:53,260","08:54,260","\"I don't feel safe.\""]
["08:54,260","09:00,260","\"I learned to stage one emitters in three, two, one.\""]
["09:00,260","09:03,260","\"Whoa!\""]
["09:03,260","09:08,260","\"I'm seeing predictable phase rays.\""]
["09:08,260","09:10,260","\"Ughhhhhh!\""]
["09:10,260","09:16,260","\"Stage 2, we need to hear this activity now.\""]
["09:16,260","09:20,260","\"We have just been informed that the sample is ready, Gordon.\""]
["09:20,260","09:21,260","\"Woo!\""]
["09:21,260","09:23,260","\"We should be coming up with you at any point.\""]
