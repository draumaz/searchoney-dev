["05:57,220","05:59,520","\"I murdered my wife.\""]
["05:59,520","06:03,560","\"Just so that he could see cool imagery.\""]
["06:03,560","06:06,560","\"I want to be wrong with the darkness, Sora.\""]
["06:06,560","06:08,440","\"- Be happy that was the twist at the end\""]
["06:08,440","06:10,360","\"Is that goofy takes this whole thing over?\""]

["06:22,400","06:24,920","\"- My favorite thing about the Captain Planet theme song\""]

["06:47,920","06:55,920","\"And we called it fun vision because what they would do with that cartoon is they keep putting borders around the screen\""]
["06:55,920","07:00,920","\"and randomly footage of them in concert would go by as the cartoon is playing in the back.\""]
["07:00,920","07:04,920","\"It was very strange. That's pretty epic.\""]
