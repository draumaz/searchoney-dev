["00:48,840","00:51,920","\"of this game, not that bootleg thing.\""]
["00:51,920","00:55,420","\"- Yeah, this is a good game, it's got good graphic.\""]
["00:55,420","00:57,080","\"It's got a good man. - It's right there.\""]
["00:57,080","00:59,080","\"The best thing about this game is the font.\""]
["00:59,080","01:00,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:00,080","01:01,080","\"I can't agree more.\""]
["01:01,080","01:05,960","\"Why do you think they made those zeros at the top slant-wise?\""]
["01:05,960","01:07,800","\"I don't know.\""]
["01:07,800","01:09,840","\"They like to italicize numbers.\""]

["01:12,080","01:14,120","\"Wow, you dodged that question.\""]
["01:14,120","01:15,720","\"Maybe the Italians did it.\""]
["01:15,720","01:18,960","\"You know, the Axis powers in World War II, they were all working together.\""]
["01:18,960","01:20,640","\"They fucking confused us.\""]

["01:25,880","01:26,880","\"Tell me that.\""]
["01:26,880","01:29,340","\"I don't know where the name of the Alex came from.\""]
["01:29,340","01:31,980","\"Where did Times New Roman come from, Tomar?\""]
["01:31,980","01:33,620","\"The Romans?\""]
["01:33,620","01:35,580","\"Was it a new time for them?\""]
["01:35,580","01:42,660","\"I mean, I think it's a modern take on what was a normal Roman typography.\""]
["01:42,660","01:47,500","\"You think a really pretentious guy creating fonts and was like, \"\"Mmm!\"\"\""]
["01:47,500","01:49,300","\"This is why schools are getting rid of history.\""]
["01:49,300","01:51,980","\"No one gives a shit.\""]
["01:51,980","01:53,500","\"I dare you to go down that toilet.\""]

["01:54,500","01:55,500","\"Yeah, it's not a toilet.\""]
["01:55,500","02:01,080","\"It's an evil crevice most Val it goes right to the sewer. It's a toilet. That is true. Oh smart\""]
["02:01,080","02:02,720","\"I found a toilet\""]
["02:02,720","02:05,280","\"Please remember me the way I lived\""]
["02:05,280","02:08,580","\"Covered in popes swimming in feces\""]
["02:08,580","02:12,620","\"Yeah\""]
["02:12,620","02:15,360","\"Wow\""]
["02:15,360","02:20,420","\"Cool now I too can take life just like him well covered in feces\""]

["02:24,620","02:26,620","\"Yes\""]
["02:26,620","02:32,100","\"Okay, this is this is going a lot better than that other game we played I know right\""]
["02:32,100","02:39,620","\"I'm not constantly searching for stuff that should be in obvious places. Yeah, I mean look I edited those episodes\""]
["02:39,620","02:44,780","\"There's a difference between challenging and just getting lost a bunch. Yeah, and\""]
["02:44,780","02:53,500","\"Let me just say are you blaming me or the game? Yes, both. Yes. That's fair. That's completely fair\""]
["02:53,500","02:59,140","\"See that's what you're supposed to do in life. You're supposed to listen to both sides and blame them both\""]
["02:59,140","03:06,180","\"Exactly kill green men and fucking walk around with a torch lantern. You got some toilets everywhere\""]
["03:06,180","03:09,460","\"I don't know these guys can't hold it very long\""]
["03:09,460","03:14,740","\"They're always looking around looking for the royal toilets the Royal it's the Royal it's\""]
["03:14,740","03:21,900","\"That's a good name for a band the Royal it's yeah, you got to admit that's pretty good if\""]
["03:23,460","03:27,060","\"If the Queen of England wanted to take a dump on your chest, would you let her do it?\""]
["03:27,060","03:28,580","\"No\""]
["03:28,580","03:31,100","\"What if she said it was a really regal dumb?\""]
["03:31,100","03:36,960","\"She was like I've been eating nothing but gold for the last three weeks. I'd just be like I don't want to\""]
["03:36,960","03:43,220","\"I don't want to be covered in you ma'am. I've been starring in many BuzzFeed videos where I tried golden pieces\""]
["03:43,220","03:47,880","\"There's got to be some way where you could manipulate that situation to your financial advantage\""]
["03:47,880","03:53,220","\"Recorded and then you say I've got amazing footage of the Queen you will not believe\""]
["03:53,220","03:58,900","\"And then you make the royal family pay you a ransom to not release the footage\""]
["03:58,900","04:03,780","\"Wow you freaking died already\""]
["04:03,780","04:06,860","\"Red game over\""]
["04:06,860","04:09,340","\"save\""]
["04:09,340","04:13,900","\"Now that's recorded in the annals of history to Mar whatever you're death\""]
["04:13,900","04:18,960","\"Everyone's gonna make fun of those three hearts isn't enough. I billons come to neck fun of you\""]
["04:18,960","04:22,340","\"I was born with only two to Mar to hearts. Yes\""]
["04:22,340","04:27,940","\"What has two hearts? I know there's something that has two hearts. What has two hearts and is read all over\""]
["04:27,940","04:30,580","\"It's a newspaper silly fuck you\""]
["04:30,580","04:38,020","\"These supers have hearts. Yes, you mean at the card the whoa what that?\""]
["04:38,020","04:45,460","\"Pot it levitated. Yeah, I threw it like right before that maybe someone took a helium filled shit in it\""]
["04:45,460","04:48,340","\"helium shit if you like\""]
["04:48,660","04:53,340","\"Swallow a bunch of helium. Let's say you like not like suck the air out from a balloon\""]
["04:53,340","04:57,380","\"But you swallow it does that like stay in you and then when you take a shit it can like\""]
["04:57,380","05:03,340","\"You know I think that would actually like make you sick if you inhale even a little bit of healing\""]
["05:03,340","05:07,580","\"You get headaches and shit. These are jerks. Oh my god. Just run away. You little pussy\""]
["05:07,580","05:10,940","\"There you go. Just nail that guy. Oh\""]
["05:10,940","05:14,380","\"Decom- No, damn baby. Oh, Tomar\""]
["05:15,380","05:18,820","\"This is a fucking daring escapade. I must say\""]
["05:18,820","05:21,860","\"She look at me really blowing it\""]
["05:21,860","05:29,740","\"The iconic tomar squares, how did they make the back runs look so real? I really believe I mean\""]
["05:29,740","05:37,100","\"They beveled the corners Lyle. Yes, that means that it's real. Yes\""]
["05:37,100","05:39,700","\"All real things are bad\""]
["05:40,900","05:46,540","\"Every bevel shows me this is so that's kind of an unwritten rule to a mark that the more bevels\""]
["05:46,540","05:48,720","\"Something has the more real it is yeah\""]
["05:48,720","05:54,660","\"That's why if your relationship has very few bevels that means it's not gonna last exactly\""]
["05:54,660","05:59,060","\"So if you look at the corner of a wall in any game, it's more than likely not gonna be be oh, yeah\""]
["05:59,060","06:02,260","\"So if you see a beveled corner in a game, it means it's real\""]
["06:02,260","06:05,900","\"That's a good idea. That's a great idea\""]
["06:06,660","06:10,920","\"So a while tell me um what kind of things did you learn this week?\""]
["06:10,920","06:17,060","\"I mean I learned a lot about bevels. I didn't expect to but here I am that very little actually\""]
["06:17,060","06:23,720","\"You're supposed to learn something new every day. That's you know who said that Chris Bill Cosby did he yes\""]
["06:23,720","06:29,780","\"That is a bill Cosby quote. He was a very successful man. It doesn't make it less valid of a thing\""]
["06:29,780","06:35,940","\"Finally the beeping's end. Yeah, just cuz I say that you're cool. Does it mean it's not true?\""]
["06:36,420","06:41,420","\"You just double negative me into fucking blank space.\""]
["06:41,420","06:43,300","\"- I didn't even know what I'd said.\""]
["06:43,300","06:45,300","\"I didn't even understand what I'm saying.\""]
["06:45,300","06:47,640","\"Get him.\""]
["06:47,640","06:50,040","\"- Fucking that dude in his silly mace.\""]
["06:50,040","06:53,140","\"He thinks he can hold the princess key.\""]
["06:53,140","06:55,960","\"Is that Princess Zulda?\""]
["06:55,960","06:56,800","\"- Yes.\""]
["06:56,800","06:57,640","\"- Now she is my partner.\""]
["06:57,640","06:59,220","\"- Thank you, smart.\""]
["06:59,220","07:00,060","\"- Smart.\""]
["07:00,060","07:01,600","\"- This is carefully.\""]
["07:01,600","07:03,720","\"Your name is very silly and that makes you\""]
["07:03,720","07:04,720","\"the chosen one.\""]
["07:05,920","07:07,280","\"He's such a silly name.\""]
["07:07,280","07:09,920","\"You definitely must be connected to me.\""]
["07:09,920","07:11,760","\"You understand?\""]
["07:11,760","07:13,120","\"No, Tomar.\""]
["07:13,120","07:16,920","\"She's just going to say exactly the same thing.\""]
["07:16,920","07:19,840","\"Let's get out of here before the wizard notices.\""]
["07:19,840","07:23,680","\"She knows a secret path, but first we have to get to the first floor.\""]
["07:23,680","07:25,200","\"The top of the...\""]
["07:25,200","07:27,040","\"The roof kind of looks like a nut sack.\""]
["07:27,040","07:29,120","\"Why'd they lock her up with ten rupees?\""]
["07:29,120","07:29,920","\"I don't know.\""]
["07:29,920","07:31,920","\"This is like her castle, right?\""]
["07:31,920","07:33,920","\"It's been taken over by Dogman.\""]
["07:33,920","07:35,840","\"That's world building you fucking idiots.\""]
["07:35,840","07:36,500","\"Yes.\""]
["07:36,500","07:39,200","\"That makes you have to think like how did she get to 10 rupees in there?\""]
["07:39,200","07:40,400","\"She had to squat him out.\""]
["07:40,400","07:41,960","\"Squat him out.\""]
["07:41,960","07:44,800","\"She kept him in her prison pocket.\""]
["07:44,800","07:46,760","\"She wasn't going to keep him inside.\""]
["07:46,760","07:47,320","\"They're sharp.\""]
["07:47,320","07:52,960","\"Or in her adjacent conviction slot, which women really get an advantage in prison for having to.\""]
["07:52,960","07:56,080","\"Wow, what would you do if you were like,\""]
["07:56,080","07:59,520","\"babe, I need you to like hang on to my precious jewel.\""]
["07:59,520","08:02,640","\"And then she gave it back and all of the sharp edges were gone.\""]
["08:02,640","08:05,520","\"It was a perfect sphere. I would be like my bevels\""]
["08:05,520","08:09,120","\"My battles no\""]
["08:09,120","08:18,240","\"What if she said I'm sorry, but uh my vaginal acids were very strong today\""]
["08:18,240","08:25,240","\"Would you be really fucking mad? I'd be really fucking horny would you just say if she debuffled you, Julie?\""]
["08:25,240","08:28,920","\"I like that\""]
["08:29,640","08:33,040","\"Beveling if someone gives you a precious jewel and you debevil it\""]
["08:33,040","08:35,680","\"That's pretty much the most disrespectful\""]
["08:35,680","08:40,980","\"Cuz I don't know if that removes values or anything from a jewel\""]
["08:40,980","08:47,860","\"I don't know. I'm sure a perfect orb might might also be valuable in jewel form perfect orb is very hard to come by\""]
["08:47,860","08:52,940","\"Yeah, I don't know I I guess not I guess for like diamond rings and stuff\""]
["08:52,940","08:57,340","\"They don't try to get it to be like an orb although that's just like an artificial like thing that we've just\""]
["08:58,300","09:02,060","\"Decided has value is how a jewel is cut is it?\""]
["09:02,060","09:08,400","\"I don't know mr. Emeralds you tell me I used to have a perfect orb made of steel and it was real shiny\""]
["09:08,400","09:12,640","\"And then I left it in the garage for a month and when I came back it was completely rusted over\""]
["09:12,640","09:18,700","\"And I had and I tried de-rusting it, but now it's lost all of its shine. So it's just steel matte orb\""]
["09:18,700","09:23,860","\"Yeah, I remember when when I was like when I was like 14 or something\""]
["09:23,860","09:27,300","\"I found like this website called true swords calm\""]
["09:27,300","09:29,700","\"And I'm like, yo, this is epic.\""]
["09:29,700","09:33,700","\"- No, I used to love swords and I bought a sword.\""]
["09:33,700","09:36,340","\"I guess it's from the movie Hero, but it looked pretty cool.\""]
["09:36,340","09:39,500","\"And then yeah, like completely rusted in like a month.\""]
["09:39,500","09:43,340","\"- They always had Gandalf sword and Bilbo sting.\""]
["09:43,340","09:48,100","\"They had like a really realistic like 300 sword\""]
["09:48,100","09:48,940","\"that I had.\""]
["09:48,940","09:51,420","\"And it was like, like actually like I could kill someone\""]
["09:51,420","09:52,900","\"with this if I wanted.\""]
["09:52,900","09:55,220","\"And then I just like threw it in a dumpster one night.\""]
["09:55,220","09:56,620","\"- 'Cause I didn't want it anymore.\""]
["09:56,620","09:57,780","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:57,780","10:02,020","\"So I was like, I'm not gonna fucking like sell this anywhere.\""]
["10:02,020","10:04,180","\"So I just kinda like snuck it out to a dumpster\""]
["10:04,180","10:05,340","\"and put it in there.\""]
["10:05,340","10:06,180","\"Fuck.\""]
["10:06,180","10:07,340","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:07,340","10:09,780","\"I was really scared that I was just gonna get like caught\""]
["10:09,780","10:11,660","\"like throwing a sword in a dumpster.\""]
["10:11,660","10:13,420","\"So I did it like 4 a.m.\""]
["10:13,420","10:16,020","\"Which makes the risk of it like even higher\""]
["10:16,020","10:17,860","\"if someone sees you, but no one saw me.\""]
["10:17,860","10:19,420","\"When I was like 10,\""]
["10:19,420","10:21,980","\"when the Lord of the Rings one first came out,\""]
["10:21,980","10:24,620","\"the silversmith in my town of Wexford,\""]
["10:24,620","10:25,940","\"he made these little silver,\""]

["10:31,460","10:35,660","\"But there used to be a ring in its hand of a hobbit. But anyway, I bought it\""]
["10:35,660","10:38,020","\"I was like mom can I please get it? It was only like a hundred?\""]
