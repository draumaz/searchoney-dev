["06:22,680","06:23,480","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["06:23,480","06:24,680","\"Not for the right reasons.\""]
["06:24,680","06:25,480","\"What is happening?\""]
["06:25,480","06:26,080","\"Is that?\""]
["06:26,080","06:28,080","\"I thought that was a glitch or something.\""]
["06:28,080","06:30,580","\"Oh, no, I think they just expect you to.\""]

["07:03,540","07:07,640","\"They also had to change it for America because originally the villain in Angel Cop\""]
