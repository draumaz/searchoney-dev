["01:11,940","01:12,940","\"Eevees!\""]
["01:12,940","01:16,900","\"No, because they had to keep this one really simple.\""]
["01:16,900","01:20,340","\"They barely could contain all the variables as it is, and that's why the game fights a\""]
["01:20,340","01:21,340","\"lot.\""]
["01:21,340","01:23,340","\"They probably introduced it in the second time.\""]

["01:58,340","02:03,340","\"I would take her to the candy shop.\""]

["02:48,060","02:50,900","\"I don't know I kept saying from Bose's\""]
["02:50,900","02:59,240","\"Do you think throw bozes evolved through scoliosis or the other way around no scoliosis evolves from strong bozes from Bose's is scary\""]
["02:59,240","03:04,740","\"What is it everybody everybody's deep vein from Bose's submit your\""]
["03:04,740","03:06,660","\"design ideas for\""]
["03:06,660","03:12,380","\"From Bose's and scoliosis. What do they look like as poking on mass are those eyeballs looking at you from inside those things?\""]
["03:12,380","03:16,540","\"Yeah, are they really tangle up tangle up they have tangle is in cages\""]
["03:16,540","03:22,160","\"*Squeary noises* I think it's supposed to be that old type of computer that uses like the magnetic tape.\""]
["03:22,160","03:24,160","\"It looks like a big long Pokemon.\""]
["03:24,160","03:27,100","\"*Squeary noises* Squirrely-Oli!\""]
["03:27,100","03:33,300","\"*Squeary noises* Squirrely-Oli? *Laughs* Yeah, squirrely. *Laughs* Pokemon names are so stupid.\""]
["03:33,300","03:38,940","\"What are you talking about? They're awful. What was the new one that was uh... What about Pikachu?\""]
["03:38,940","03:46,420","\"Pikachu's... I guess. *Laughs* That's 'cause it's Japanese. Yeah, that's also its Japanese names. What about togapi?\""]
["03:46,420","03:51,880","\"I don't think toga pay me is anything I like the Pokemon names that are just sounds what about Scyther\""]
["03:51,880","03:55,620","\"What about Scyther's not a good name. What about Garados?\""]
["03:55,620","03:58,180","\"Gyarados\""]
["03:58,180","04:03,780","\"What about eggs? What is it called in Japanese like something Kraken? What about whip dippy?\""]
["04:03,780","04:07,640","\"Whip dippy? Is that real? No, should be\""]
["04:07,640","04:11,160","\"Whip dippy. Whip dippy. I choose you\""]
["04:11,160","04:14,180","\"Fight him\""]
["04:14,180","04:20,900","\"I don't like ash ketchup who has the lift key of a brush smash and what about\""]
["04:20,900","04:30,100","\"ads block on youtube i use it remember when coughing had little smoke hands coming out of him he\""]
["04:30,100","04:35,380","\"doesn't mean this one he sure doesn't even green right i think there's a lot of art we i've\""]
["04:35,380","04:39,940","\"talked about this already i think i think probably since it's been so long it's been a really long\""]
["04:39,940","04:43,440","\"- Long time we're sorry for it if we repeat ourselves.\""]
["04:43,440","04:44,340","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:44,340","04:45,980","\"- I really like the original art though.\""]
["04:45,980","04:46,820","\"- If you just took it.\""]
["04:46,820","04:49,020","\"- I like those nice watercolors.\""]
["04:49,020","04:52,020","\"- The old Kensugi Mori shed is so fun.\""]
["04:52,020","04:53,860","\"- Use more fun with his artwork too.\""]
["04:53,860","04:54,700","\"- It was.\""]
["04:54,700","04:57,440","\"I liked a lot of the designs back then.\""]
["04:57,440","04:59,540","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:59,540","05:02,100","\"- I like a lot of the new ones too,\""]
["05:02,100","05:06,020","\"but it's a different style, and I miss the old style.\""]
["05:06,020","05:09,380","\"- Someone made that post on Reddit where it was\""]
["05:09,380","05:13,380","\"The old style is nice because they have triangular eyes.\""]
["05:13,380","05:16,380","\"The new style is bad because of their circles.\""]
["05:16,380","05:18,380","\"And everyone upvoted.\""]
["05:18,380","05:20,380","\"Is it a joke?\""]
["05:20,380","05:21,380","\"No.\""]
["05:21,380","05:23,380","\"It's not the problem.\""]
["05:23,380","05:25,380","\"That's what he said.\""]
["05:25,380","05:31,380","\"The problem is that there's not really variety between any of the human characters he designs now.\""]
["05:31,380","05:32,380","\"Yeah, that's also very scary.\""]
["05:32,380","05:35,380","\"And they're also very overblown in terms of design.\""]
["05:35,380","05:36,380","\"And there's a good...\""]
["05:36,380","05:38,380","\"I would say they're under-designed.\""]
["05:38,380","05:40,380","\"I don't think enough of them have visual gimmicks.\""]
["05:40,380","05:42,380","\"I think some of the gym leaders that...\""]
["05:42,380","05:44,380","\"People don't just sit still.\""]
["05:44,380","05:46,380","\"Pass it to Chris if you're gonna...\""]
["05:46,380","05:47,380","\"Here, you play them.\""]
["05:47,380","05:50,380","\"Some of the gym leaders that I can recall from newer generations.\""]
["05:50,380","05:52,380","\"He goes really over the top.\""]
["05:52,380","05:55,380","\"Just slapping as much as he can onto their clothing.\""]
["05:55,380","05:58,380","\"Well, I think that's really cool.\""]
["05:58,380","06:03,380","\"I think the new generation, they're getting a decent balance\""]
["06:03,380","06:05,380","\"going for some of those designs.\""]
["06:05,380","06:07,380","\"Nothing looks like regular fucking people.\""]
["06:07,380","06:12,780","\"Some of the Pokemon. Oh the Pokemon. Yeah the Pokemon are fine. I think some of the Pokemon there's more the only the bear\""]
["06:12,780","06:19,740","\"The the pink bear one that actually reminds me of some of the only Pokemon generation that I actually like dislike is\""]
["06:19,740","06:25,060","\"Diamond Pearl. I think a lot of the Pokemon. I think black and white has some weak ones too. I\""]
["06:25,060","06:28,580","\"Think both of those are pretty weak generations\""]
["06:28,580","06:32,100","\"Black and white gave me\""]
["06:32,100","06:36,660","\"Chandelure is my favorite. I think that's black and white. Where's that X and Y?\""]
["06:36,660","06:40,660","\"We know nothing about Pokemon.\""]
["06:40,660","06:48,660","\"I mean, I stopped playing at Diamond and Pearl because it was so subpar.\""]
["06:48,660","06:56,660","\"It's because when you're playing these, when you've lived for thousands of years and you've played the Pokemon games over and over again,\""]
["06:56,660","07:02,660","\"you realize that they're all the same thing, so you can only be so invested in it.\""]
["07:02,660","07:07,180","\"And you would hope for big changes and for a while they were doing it\""]
["07:07,180","07:12,340","\"I wish they branched off and did like something more adulty with it because golden silver was\""]
["07:12,340","07:16,500","\"Fantastic that was a perfect sequel because they added so much to it\""]
["07:16,500","07:20,220","\"Yeah, you get the first game mixed in there too. It's not not the full game\""]
["07:20,220","07:26,660","\"They had a lot of it. Yeah a lot of it there. Yeah, you you get more never did that again\""]
["07:26,660","07:28,940","\"I think the closest they came was in\""]
["07:30,060","07:33,460","\"Heart no not heart it was in a fire red and leaf green\""]
["07:33,460","07:39,380","\"They had the extra islands after you beat the elite floor and I think that was the only other time that they did what like\""]
["07:39,380","07:44,660","\"Is that the highest level fight from a trainer is in golden silver when you fight red?\""]
["07:44,660","07:49,060","\"Thanks, so yeah, because his get they don't get up to level 90, but they come really close I\""]
["07:49,060","07:54,820","\"I don't like that. They they hit they had areas like that which was really nice that it's like hey\""]
["07:54,820","07:56,620","\"Yeah, you beat the game\""]
["07:56,620","08:05,020","\"But look at this the levels actually get higher and there's more difficulty. There's more stuff to actually do here and the game's never typically go that far\""]
["08:05,020","08:11,340","\"Wait, it wasn't just everything was bigger about it\""]
["08:11,340","08:16,700","\"They they have like the radio and everything - you felt like you're a part of that world even though it's just a little game boy game\""]
["08:16,700","08:21,540","\"All the artwork in it's fantastic the sprites look amazing\""]
["08:21,540","08:25,060","\"It's really really good stuff really good music\""]
["08:25,580","08:28,440","\"It's just a really good sequel. It was it was tough match\""]
["08:28,440","08:32,500","\"It was they also were saying that that was probably gonna be the last game\""]
["08:32,500","08:36,440","\"We kept it really that's what I remember hearing was that they\""]
["08:36,440","08:41,320","\"They were thinking that might have been just it but they're gonna finish the series off with that\""]
["08:41,320","08:43,300","\"but\""]
["08:43,300","08:49,960","\"Ruby and Sapphire is pretty good. They I don't think it's as big or as drastic of an improvement as Golden Silver was\""]
["08:49,960","08:52,760","\"But they did a lot of fun stuff with that too. I\""]
["08:53,260","08:56,400","\"I liked uh, that's when they added abilities they had a\""]
["08:56,400","08:58,240","\"That was a fun\""]
["08:58,240","09:03,200","\"Inclusion remember they had two different bikes you could do tricks on the one bike. What really bad you had to swap\""]
["09:03,200","09:05,760","\"Yeah, you had to swap them which kind of stuff. I don't enjoy that\""]
["09:05,760","09:08,280","\"I mean like how else are you supposed to make it?\""]
["09:08,280","09:14,200","\"Ruby and Sapphire and it's a choice. Yes, they did which is nice\""]
["09:14,200","09:18,040","\"That way you could still run fast without having to hit bases were kind of fun, too\""]
["09:18,040","09:20,040","\"I like doing hidden bases\""]
["09:20,040","09:25,280","\"Because if you use the link cable somebody they could actually find your hidden base. Yeah, it was fun\""]
["09:25,280","09:28,380","\"Jeff\""]
["09:28,380","09:30,740","\"What is your favorite Pokemon?\""]
["09:30,740","09:34,520","\"- chandelor, okay\""]
["09:34,520","09:37,840","\"Tanglea is pretty good\""]
["09:37,840","09:45,360","\"Why tanglea? Yeah, because Tanglea like his little red shoes. Yeah, he doesn't he has cartoony eyes that they I don't think they've used\""]
["09:45,360","09:49,620","\"That's what I was gonna say is he doesn't really feel like a Pokemon design compared to everything else\""]
["09:49,620","09:52,620","\"I think that's kind of why I like them.\""]
["09:52,620","09:55,620","\"This is amusing much at all.\""]
["09:55,620","09:57,620","\"Where's the fucking lift key?\""]
["09:57,620","09:59,620","\"Yeah, talk to the mastery beat then.\""]
["09:59,620","10:00,620","\"What's he say?\""]
["10:00,620","10:01,620","\"Oh no.\""]
["10:01,620","10:02,620","\"Oh no, I dropped the lift key.\""]
["10:02,620","10:03,620","\"(laughs)\""]

["10:07,620","10:09,620","\"(laughs)\""]
["10:09,620","10:10,620","\"That's a...\""]
