["07:08,560","07:11,360","\"It's a little selfie.\""]
["07:11,360","07:13,120","\"Take a self-pusher in there.\""]

["07:16,120","07:17,120","\"I fucked up.\""]
["07:17,120","07:19,120","\"I can reset it.\""]
["07:19,120","07:20,120","\"What?\""]
["07:20,120","07:21,120","\"You got to reset it.\""]
["07:21,120","07:22,120","\"Why?\""]
["07:22,120","07:23,120","\"Why?\""]
["07:23,120","07:25,880","\"It says, it says, \"\"Is this the path you want?\"\" and you say, \"\"No.\"\"\""]
["07:25,880","07:26,880","\"Why?\""]
["07:26,880","07:30,280","\"'cause this little quiz determines how you level up.\""]
["07:30,280","07:31,120","\"Really?\""]
["07:31,120","07:32,560","\"- Yes, it's fucking stupid.\""]

["07:38,440","07:39,280","\"- Oh, this still counts.\""]
["07:39,280","07:42,240","\"- On second thought, I mean, you wanted to do the regular\""]
["07:42,240","07:43,160","\"where there's no variance, right?\""]
["07:43,160","07:44,000","\"- Yeah, do that.\""]
["07:44,000","07:44,840","\"Do that one.\""]
["07:44,840","07:49,800","\"So you pick all the top options,\""]
["07:49,800","07:52,320","\"you level up really quick, but then you stop leveling up.\""]
["07:52,320","07:54,680","\"It goes really slow at the end of the game.\""]
["07:54,680","07:56,840","\"Other way around, if you pick the bottom options,\""]
["07:56,840","08:01,080","\"Metal has it just averaged the whole way through. There's no indication of that\""]
["08:01,080","08:03,840","\"You're just supposed to know\""]
["08:03,840","08:07,160","\"I\""]
["08:07,160","08:14,120","\"Won stop every time I do a song you say it sounds like you always do that one song\""]
["08:14,120","08:16,680","\"No, it does sound like that go that that they let\""]
["08:16,680","08:19,820","\"Did it let it did it let this game has\""]
["08:19,820","08:23,040","\"Julian do you like the hollow bastion music? Oh?\""]

["08:32,800","08:36,040","\"Hmm. We'll put only dinner here. I\""]
["08:36,040","08:39,000","\"Think we should turn this off to avoid\""]
["08:39,000","08:44,000","\"Tell me again about how when Kingdom Hearts was first announced you thought it was an April fools prank\""]
["08:44,000","08:47,240","\"what that I\""]
["08:47,240","08:53,320","\"Got a gaming magazine and it said coming soon Kingdom Hearts also a show Gregory horror show was in there\""]
["08:53,320","08:55,800","\"And that pissed me off because I really wanted that to come out over here\""]
["08:55,800","08:57,440","\"but\""]
["08:57,440","09:02,460","\"Which that one doesn't make it was that before the that was yeah the game was before the show right\""]
["09:02,460","09:05,560","\"game was after after the show, but\""]
["09:05,560","09:10,040","\"That's fully translated it came out in Europe. I don't know why we didn't get it\""]
["09:10,040","09:16,800","\"But they it said coming soon Kingdom Hearts and it showed one of the heartless is the one wearing the helmet\""]
["09:16,800","09:18,800","\"It was talking about heart\""]
["09:19,160","09:23,360","\"Darkness it was like mentioning all this stuff and then here's all these Disney characters\""]
["09:23,360","09:28,000","\"I just thought myself what the fuck is this is this the April fools magazine because they would do that yeah\""]
["09:28,000","09:34,840","\"Every magazine had their April fools jokes like there was a I think electronic gaming monthly had the one where it showed the fake Sonic\""]
["09:34,840","09:39,480","\"And Super Smash Bros. Melee yeah stuff like that so I thought it was an April fools joke\""]
["09:39,480","09:41,120","\"I didn't think it was a real game\""]
["09:41,120","09:44,560","\"But then it came out because why the what?\""]
["09:45,200","09:51,680","\"What made them think that was a good idea as I really don't know how they came up with that idea and why it's stuck\""]
["09:51,680","09:56,400","\"I don't know I don't know why it worked. It was a Disney representative and a squirr Enix representative\""]
["09:56,400","10:02,480","\"No, I know that I know that I know about all that but still what made them think that was a good idea\""]
["10:02,480","10:08,200","\"Well, obviously it was I guess I guess you can't say that if it fucking took off\""]
["10:08,200","10:15,160","\"It took off cuz I mean I don't know why it took off cuz children are fucking kids dummies like stupid shit\""]
["10:15,160","10:19,960","\"It's like seeing their favorite characters meet everybody I've talked to as the same story\""]
["10:19,960","10:21,960","\"They picked up the game because they saw that\""]
["10:21,960","10:27,480","\"Nightmare before Christmas was in it and that's definitely why I picked it up because I had Final Fantasy in it\""]
["10:27,480","10:34,040","\"Well, that probably makes more sense considering the audience. I didn't even like any other Final Fantasy part from 7 when I was younger\""]
["10:34,040","10:38,760","\"I still kind of don't I never played six even though I'm here. That's the best one\""]
["10:38,760","10:41,080","\"I think you would like six\""]
["10:41,080","10:44,200","\"When I was uh when I first played this I thought the plot was really deep and\""]
["10:44,920","10:47,080","\"- What other than? - Of course.\""]
["10:47,080","10:48,960","\"- But we were a little general.\""]
["10:48,960","10:51,400","\"- Because if you convince your audience enough\""]
["10:51,400","10:53,400","\"that your flight is-- - I mean, it's too late.\""]
["10:53,400","10:54,940","\"- Yeah, all you have to do is be like,\""]
["10:54,940","10:58,720","\"\"\"Oh, heart, a kairi is in the darkness.\"\"\""]
["10:58,720","11:01,280","\"And you're like, \"\"Wow, really?\"\"\""]
["11:01,280","11:03,160","\"- It's almost like how Five Nights at Freddy's,\""]
["11:03,160","11:05,000","\"if you just hide a stupid message,\""]
["11:05,000","11:06,640","\"it makes everyone think it's deep.\""]
["11:06,640","11:10,200","\"- It's all about how you communicate this shit.\""]
["11:10,200","11:12,240","\"- The point is kids are really stupid,\""]
["11:12,240","11:13,760","\"and a lot of the stuff you like when you're young\""]
["11:13,760","11:14,880","\"You're probably in so hot now.\""]
["11:14,880","11:15,880","\"What's you doing?\""]

["11:20,840","11:23,160","\"Get in me.\""]
["11:23,160","11:25,520","\"Why does he have a heart hole?\""]
["11:25,520","11:30,360","\"Well, doesn't have a heart hole for heart hole for.\""]
["11:30,360","11:31,760","\"Cartoons, don't do that.\""]
["11:31,760","11:35,200","\"You beat it.\""]
["11:35,200","11:37,000","\"Oh, jump, jump, jump, jump.\""]

["11:38,000","11:39,000","\"Oh.\""]
["11:39,000","11:40,440","\"You're supposed to jump when it goes slow.\""]
["11:40,440","11:43,160","\"I'll say the one thing that Kingdom Hearts\""]
["11:43,160","11:48,120","\"added that I fucking hated was how you couldn't win a boss battle until you\""]
["11:48,120","11:53,680","\"finished a combo. Really? And so you'd always get stuck because you know\""]
["11:53,680","11:57,320","\"something they would like counter your attacks or something. At least in this\""]
["11:57,320","12:01,960","\"one it's just like okay when their HP hit zero you win. Yeah that makes more\""]
["12:01,960","12:07,560","\"sense. It's because they want it to look cooler when it does that like a slow-mo\""]
["12:07,560","12:12,120","\"thing. Julian yeah next time you beat a boss and it goes slow-mo you jump and you\""]
["12:12,120","12:14,280","\"Swing your sword and it looks cool, okay?\""]
["12:14,280","12:14,780","\"Wow.\""]
