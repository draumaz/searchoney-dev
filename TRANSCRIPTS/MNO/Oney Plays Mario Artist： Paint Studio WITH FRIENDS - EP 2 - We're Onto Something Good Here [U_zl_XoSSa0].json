["00:23,540","00:24,980","\"That's a weird finish button.\""]
["00:24,980","00:26,220","\"- Okay, we'll click a frame.\""]
["00:26,220","00:29,140","\"- To add a stop, to play.\""]
["00:29,140","00:31,000","\"Okay, uh-oh, okay.\""]
["00:31,000","00:32,720","\"Okay, so here's a frame.\""]
["00:32,720","00:33,960","\"- Okay, now draw a frame.\""]
["00:33,960","00:35,240","\"- So I'm gonna animate something.\""]
["00:35,240","00:36,080","\"- Yeah, do it.\""]
["00:36,080","00:38,000","\"Chris, this is your first cartoon since...\""]
["00:38,000","00:42,960","\"- Your funny Pillsbury Doughboy parody.\""]
["00:42,960","00:44,360","\"- Pillsbury Doughboy?\""]
["00:44,360","00:46,280","\"- Remember your parody you did of him?\""]
["00:46,280","00:47,560","\"- No, what?\""]
["00:47,560","00:50,300","\"- Remember he gets poked and he starts shitting\""]
["00:50,300","00:51,240","\"and it's really funny.\""]
["00:51,240","00:52,400","\"- Wait, what?\""]
["00:52,400","00:53,640","\"What are you talking about?\""]
["00:53,640","00:56,080","\"- I'm making something up, Chris.\""]
["00:56,080","00:56,920","\"- Are you?\""]
["00:56,920","00:58,080","\"- You didn't go with it, Chris.\""]
["00:58,080","01:04,960","\"Don't don't fuck you talking about I thought you were talking about you talked to me about shit. I have made that's awful\""]
["01:04,960","01:10,340","\"Chris what that wouldn't be bad as a video. Oh, he's so happy. Look. It's a little man\""]
["01:10,340","01:15,280","\"What's it gonna do so now I go to the next one you click the bomb to finish this frame, okay?\""]
["01:15,280","01:20,960","\"Okay, now you do the next frame, but I can't oh, yeah, you can't see what's there is there a option\""]
["01:20,960","01:25,920","\"Like what's the down arrow onion skinning the undo is a little puppy dog, okay, so I\""]
["01:26,600","01:32,700","\"I can come back to this frame, right? Yeah, I can't. Yeah, okay. So what I can copy it. What an awful system\""]
["01:32,700","01:38,460","\"You can take stuff off the Game Boy camera if we had it all. Oh fuck me. Okay. Well, oh\""]
["01:38,460","01:42,620","\"Okay, my speed ghost oh ghost\""]
["01:42,620","01:45,780","\"what\""]
["01:45,780","01:47,140","\"What oh?\""]
["01:47,140","01:49,380","\"Click the frame that you want to ghost I guess\""]
["01:49,380","01:52,420","\"So click the first frame with a ghost\""]
["01:53,060","01:56,680","\"Think so I think that would make it a lot easier. Yeah, right\""]
["01:56,680","02:01,460","\"Ghost first friend and now go the second frame. There you go. Hey\""]
["02:01,460","02:09,300","\"Skin and baby they knew it. Okay, so what am I gonna make them do Julian? I know it would be stupid. They have that God\""]
["02:09,300","02:11,300","\"Look at that steady hand Julian\""]
["02:11,300","02:16,740","\"It's not a bad mouse. It's really not it feels good\""]
["02:16,740","02:21,780","\"What am I gonna make this clicking with it too? What am I gonna make this guy do make him sneeze sneeze?\""]
["02:21,940","02:31,440","\"This is hard squiggle vision could you theoretically plug no cuz it goes straight from that to the Nintendo huh what like a tablet\""]
["02:31,440","02:37,420","\"If someone made something I want to play the animation your two frames\""]
["02:37,420","02:46,820","\"Very good speed play again see now it looks great\""]
["02:49,940","02:55,580","\"Wow good animation. I'm gonna keep adding to it. Just give me a sec. I think you do gotta do ghost again for them\""]
["02:55,580","03:02,260","\"Yeah, I really like Japanese ghosts. I do too. They're so cool. Tell me why Julian because they fool you\""]
["03:02,260","03:05,140","\"because they're like I\""]
["03:05,140","03:12,920","\"Don't know they're different. They're they're new they're they're unfamiliar. I think they're fun\""]
["03:12,920","03:19,900","\"You know they're weird. They're really weird compared to our ghost getting lazy Chris. You gotta apply some squash and stretch here\""]
["03:19,900","03:21,900","\"What do you call that fucker?\""]
["03:21,900","03:30,260","\"Whoa, he's pushing he's squishing upwards. Yeah, there's squishes upwards when they sneeze. That's called squish open stretch squish and snizz\""]
["03:30,260","03:36,900","\"Squish and strish this is a hard Julian isn't fondue. This is a hard Julian. Give me a fucking break mister\""]
["03:36,900","03:40,060","\"Oh, is it just playing all the other is a lot of empty frames\""]
["03:40,060","03:43,020","\"blend\""]
["03:43,020","03:44,900","\"Whoa\""]
["03:44,900","03:48,740","\"Motion tween not really no, that's that's a\""]
["03:48,740","03:55,980","\"Interpolation the one with a hand okay told you the red hand well, but I think that just makes it no you put on the timeline. Oh\""]
["03:55,980","04:02,560","\"Very nice and loop it this is far\""]
["04:02,560","04:08,700","\"Yeah, Lupin speed it up\""]
["04:08,700","04:22,400","\", oh oh my god, I want to finish it no, I feel like we're on a\""]
["04:22,400","04:29,300","\"This is relaxing this is a nice a nice night in with my friends playing a little more\""]
["04:29,300","04:34,940","\"I didn't actually this is making me very happy Julian why Julian because this is basically what I'd be doing at home\""]
["04:36,920","04:38,280","\"It's like I never left.\""]
["04:38,280","04:39,600","\"- Why is he eating his eyes?\""]
["04:39,600","04:41,360","\"- 'Cause he's about to sneeze.\""]
["04:41,360","04:43,080","\"Don't you know anything about animation?\""]
["04:43,080","04:45,200","\"- You gotta let him quiver in place\""]
["04:45,200","04:46,840","\"for a little bit before he sneezes.\""]
["04:46,840","04:49,040","\"- Yeah, this will be the easing frame.\""]
["04:49,040","04:50,240","\"Okay, we're doing good.\""]
["04:50,240","04:52,080","\"- I really wish we got this over here.\""]
["04:52,080","04:53,820","\"I'm upset we never got this.\""]
["04:53,820","04:59,840","\"- Is this more user friendly than the original Mario paint?\""]
["04:59,840","05:04,660","\"- It's strange, but it's more useful.\""]
["05:04,660","05:07,780","\"For example that, having the option to do that,\""]
["05:07,780","05:10,220","\"that you can actually onion skin.\""]
["05:10,220","05:11,540","\"- Did they not have that original one?\""]
["05:11,540","05:13,980","\"- No, I remember it was just you clicked\""]
["05:13,980","05:18,020","\"between a few frames, so animating wasn't as easy.\""]
["05:18,020","05:20,020","\"Maybe it did have onion skinning,\""]
["05:20,020","05:21,500","\"I don't remember it having it.\""]
["05:21,500","05:24,740","\"- I don't think this is gonna look too good, but we'll see.\""]
["05:24,740","05:27,340","\"- There you gotta experiment sometimes.\""]
["05:27,340","05:29,260","\"- You can transfer stuff off the Game Boy camera too,\""]
["05:29,260","05:30,260","\"that's really cool.\""]
["05:30,260","05:32,500","\"- Wow.\""]
["05:32,500","05:39,920","\"They uh they released four of these so there's a whole bunch of different art games. I almost fucked up\""]
["05:39,920","05:42,020","\"Okay, so now he goes\""]
["05:42,020","05:44,320","\"This is dumb\""]
["05:44,320","05:49,300","\"Hopefully oh dog where does eyes go they're in his mouth. Why do you do that?\""]
["05:49,300","05:52,200","\"Because he sneezed\""]
["05:52,200","05:59,060","\"Yeah, it's probably gonna look pretty extreme. That's good. What does he even do?\""]
["06:00,580","06:01,860","\"I'm working on him.\""]
["06:01,860","06:03,300","\"Is he just back?\""]
["06:03,300","06:04,260","\"I'm working on it.\""]
["06:04,260","06:06,660","\"He's flipping his head around.\""]
["06:06,660","06:10,020","\"Uh, let's see if it looks okay so far.\""]
["06:10,020","06:10,820","\"It's music.\""]
["06:10,820","06:12,100","\"What's this problem?\""]
["06:12,100","06:16,900","\"Where's the loopy blends?\""]
["06:16,900","06:18,580","\"Play.\""]
["06:18,580","06:19,140","\"Loop.\""]
["06:19,140","06:22,820","\"His head been.\""]
["06:22,820","06:25,620","\"Okay.\""]
["06:25,620","06:27,380","\"Looks okay so far.\""]
["06:27,380","06:28,500","\"What's the camera option?\""]
["06:28,500","06:30,500","\"Is that to put it on your video camera or something?\""]
["06:30,500","06:35,900","\"You can make stop motion videos with it. I bet. Oh, that'd be cool because you can hook a camera up to it\""]
["06:35,900","06:38,220","\"Which we don't have so\""]
["06:38,220","06:46,060","\"But if we come back to this maybe maybe someday could you lean ready? Yeah, this is this is the grand finale. Oh boy\""]
["06:46,060","06:51,340","\"Gonna go mup. That's a stuff. Gonna come back. I love a smear\""]
["06:51,340","06:57,300","\"Coming up real fast look at them go\""]
["06:57,300","06:59,300","\"No\""]
["06:59,300","07:04,540","\"Goes one of the original for you. You're right. Yeah, you're yeah that way\""]
["07:04,540","07:08,820","\"You know where to end up you're a fucking scroll all the way back to the beginning you're a genius\""]
["07:08,820","07:12,020","\"Well if you get when he needs to he doesn't necessarily need to right now. Oh\""]
["07:12,020","07:15,580","\"My god\""]
["07:15,580","07:24,180","\"It's a little odd at first once you get used to it this is not a sneeze anymore. He's just screaming\""]
["07:24,180","07:26,180","\"I\""]
["07:26,180","07:33,920","\"Don't think this is gonna look very good. Oh Chris what?\""]
["07:33,920","07:38,120","\"This is like one of one of the only animations ever done in this\""]
["07:38,120","07:42,380","\"Don't worry about listen a bunch of kids back in 1999\""]
["07:42,380","07:47,700","\"They did cartoons in Japan that probably don't exist anymore. Oh, I'm Mario paint. Oh\""]
["07:47,700","07:50,260","\"on this yeah\""]
["07:50,260","07:52,840","\"(upbeat music)\""]
["07:52,840","07:56,980","\"- I don't know what he's doing.\""]
["07:56,980","07:58,740","\"- He can just be flailing.\""]
["07:58,740","08:05,820","\"- By the way, if anyone wants to send us more mice,\""]
["08:05,820","08:07,780","\"we might revisit this.\""]
["08:07,780","08:09,220","\"- Oh yeah, we got a PO box.\""]
["08:09,220","08:11,220","\"- More, oh yeah, we should say that.\""]
["08:11,220","08:12,380","\"What's the address for the PO box?\""]
["08:12,380","08:13,220","\"- It's on screen.\""]
["08:13,220","08:14,040","\"- It's on screen.\""]
["08:14,040","08:15,260","\"- Rod, thank you for putting the address\""]
["08:15,260","08:16,700","\"to the PO box on the screen.\""]
["08:16,700","08:18,460","\"- Let's make it do a little twirl.\""]
["08:18,460","08:19,660","\"- Oh, that's cute.\""]
["08:19,660","08:21,660","\"*laughs*\""]
["08:21,660","08:24,660","\"*moan*\""]
["08:24,660","08:26,660","\"*moan* *laughs*\""]
["08:26,660","08:28,660","\"*moan* *laughs*\""]
["08:28,660","08:29,660","\"*moan* *laughs*\""]
["08:29,660","08:31,660","\"*moan* Oh, he's a good boy.\""]
["08:31,660","08:33,660","\"What do you think?\""]
["08:33,660","08:35,660","\"Uh, the blending doesn't help him very much.\""]
["08:35,660","08:37,660","\"*moan*\""]
["08:37,660","08:39,660","\"*moan* Yeah, it might look better without it.\""]
["08:39,660","08:40,660","\"Okay.\""]
["08:40,660","08:42,660","\"Well, don't worry, we're almost there.\""]
["08:42,660","08:45,660","\"Now, people have an idea of how long animation takes,\""]
["08:45,660","08:48,780","\"Even with this dumb fucking awful shit\""]
["08:48,780","08:54,780","\"Do you know I'm gonna make him fly to the screen like you have to draw a bunch of pictures or something\""]
["08:54,780","08:57,420","\"He's just gonna fly out because he's an idiot\""]
["08:57,420","09:04,980","\"Do you know you making fun of me over there? Yeah, why you're an idiot what I mean\""]
["09:04,980","09:08,220","\"Surely why are you doing here my favorite deputy?\""]
["09:08,220","09:19,860","\"You're my favorite but you're my dad you know. I'm gonna pause and the deputy. Where's he going? Look at his little legs. Oh no\""]
["09:19,860","09:36,440","\"This is a good cartoon. I watch it on TV all the time. Man fall over. There's another leg. The music is very fitting for this.\""]
["09:36,440","09:39,440","\"Yeah, you're right. We're almost there.\""]
["09:39,440","09:45,440","\"I'm just doing it until you fill all five pages.\""]
["09:45,440","09:47,440","\"No, I'm almost done.\""]
["09:47,440","09:50,440","\"Look how shitty this goddamn shit is.\""]
["09:50,440","09:53,440","\"It stresses me out that the exit icon is a bomb.\""]
["09:53,440","09:54,440","\"Yeah, me too.\""]
["09:54,440","09:57,440","\"And now you can't bring it through the airport or nothing.\""]
["09:57,440","09:59,440","\"That's true, Chris. You can't.\""]
["09:59,440","10:03,440","\"When they see you with the cartridge, they make you put in Nintendo 64\""]
["10:03,440","10:05,440","\"for us to see if there's bombs in it.\""]
["10:05,440","10:07,440","\"Loki's almost out of here.\""]
["10:07,440","10:09,440","\"It's almost done, don't ya?\""]
["10:09,440","10:11,440","\"Look, he's just tippy toes.\""]
["10:11,440","10:13,440","\"Now he's done.\""]
["10:13,440","10:17,440","\"Now we put the funny stop head right here.\""]
["10:17,440","10:19,440","\"Hey, baby.\""]
["10:19,440","10:21,440","\"The grand finale, baby.\""]
["10:21,440","10:25,440","\"You shrunk a lot.\""]
["10:25,440","10:27,440","\"That's how it goes.\""]
["10:27,440","10:31,440","\"[Laughing]\""]
["10:31,440","10:33,700","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:33,700","10:39,740","\"- Yeah, put the thing on it, let's see how that looks.\""]
["10:39,740","10:40,700","\"- With the frames?\""]
["10:40,700","10:43,000","\"- No, with the blend on it.\""]
["10:43,000","10:45,500","\"- Yeah, I'm trying to get the speed right.\""]
["10:45,500","10:46,400","\"- That's not it.\""]
["10:46,400","10:48,380","\"- That's okay.\""]
["10:48,380","10:49,220","\"- That feels good.\""]
