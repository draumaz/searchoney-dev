["01:23,580","01:27,580","\"That uh, that doesn't just work on on these, but we'll get to that.\""]
["01:27,580","01:32,260","\"Who's that little fellow? That's someone who said something hurtful about minorities.\""]

["02:41,980","02:45,100","\"\"\"Make sure to bring their parts back to me.\"\"\""]
["02:45,100","02:48,060","\"Remember that scene in the Resident Evil movie\""]
["02:48,060","02:51,980","\"where the guy gets sliced in the cubes. Yeah, someone saw that and they were like, that\""]
["02:51,980","02:53,340","\"needs to be a video game.\""]
["02:53,340","03:02,020","\"Oh, my brain. There, I want to make a torso cube. I can't believe that. It's so cool.\""]
["03:02,020","03:06,460","\"I knew you'd like this game. If I hadn't tried learning 3D, this wouldn't be as impressive\""]
["03:06,460","03:11,580","\"because it's really hard to like cut things up like that in 3D. Yeah, I think that they\""]
["03:11,580","03:16,460","\"built that for this game specifically. I remember seeing a tech demo or something where he's\""]
["03:16,460","03:21,060","\"like cutting watermelons. Yeah. There were earlier games that did stuff like it. I know\""]
["03:21,060","03:27,460","\"the Musashi sequel had that, but that game had so many other problems that nobody noticed.\""]
["03:27,460","03:33,460","\"Nobody noticed the cutting or nobody noticed the game. Nobody noticed the game.\""]
["03:33,460","03:40,660","\"And one very evil advisor. Thank you, sir. It may appear as though I am cool, but actually\""]
["03:40,660","03:50,900","\"you are cool you are all cool I disagree he looks like David Bowie kind of\""]

["04:12,980","04:15,620","\"Yeah, you can see that he has his little scars on his face.\""]
["04:15,620","04:18,820","\"I know it's kinda not in the game.\""]
["04:18,820","04:20,700","\"Like, this is not canon.\""]
["04:20,700","04:25,140","\"Not that it fucking matters anymore because what is, but...\""]
["04:25,140","04:27,140","\"I don't care if something's canon as long as it's good.\""]
["04:27,140","04:27,980","\"Yeah, this was-\""]
["04:27,980","04:28,480","\"Yeah, no, it's-\""]
["04:28,480","04:31,980","\"I know a lot of people were mad at this game when it came out.\""]
["04:31,980","04:34,900","\"This is made by that lesser-known Kojima twin.\""]
["04:34,900","04:39,220","\"The only time something being canon matters is if it's so shit you don't want it to be canon.\""]
["04:39,220","04:39,720","\"Right.\""]
["04:39,720","04:41,760","\"But this is good, so it doesn't matter.\""]
["04:41,760","04:46,000","\"I have a cool sword in my briefcase.\""]
["04:46,000","04:46,840","\"Want to see?\""]

["04:56,480","04:58,880","\"He looks like an old woman there.\""]
["04:58,880","05:03,480","\"It really is amazing what the human body can do when you start putting robot parts in it.\""]
["05:04,600","05:05,800","\"You have womb?\""]
["05:05,800","05:06,800","\"Yes.\""]

["05:22,000","05:24,000","\"Do you recognize that blade, Chris?\""]
["05:24,000","05:25,000","\"You should.\""]
["05:25,000","05:29,000","\"I won't use my blade on an innocent person.\""]
["05:29,000","05:31,400","\"I will only use this blade to kill people.\""]
["05:31,400","05:35,700","\"Hello, a Jeff. You're a summer Genesis is way\""]
["05:35,700","05:38,660","\"You were threatened with that femme\""]
["05:38,660","05:45,540","\"He's a steal. Yeah femme tails was I feel like we're reaching a very important point in only place history\""]
["05:45,540","05:50,000","\"We are now. You know the origins. We're closing a very important loop\""]
["05:50,000","05:58,380","\"Who ever oh my god, he beat this game and kiss your ass goodbye mode Chris he did kiss your ass could\""]
["05:58,720","06:00,720","\"That was Shadow the Hedgehog. Oh, right\""]
["06:00,720","06:08,900","\"Also, this is a mate like I love these gory cutscenes. Yeah, you know this this game has some good ones\""]
["06:08,900","06:14,760","\"But I don't want people to look like this in the future if they do\""]
["06:14,760","06:20,620","\"I'll be actually I'll write something pretty strongly worded on the internet. That's fair\""]
["06:20,620","06:23,440","\"Have you seen that guy who wanted to look like a girl's murder?\""]
["06:25,440","06:27,440","\"I've seen that gift.\""]
["06:27,440","06:29,780","\"Alright, something on the internet and smile like that.\""]
["06:29,780","06:33,540","\"Everyone will call me a racist because I don't want people to look like this.\""]
["06:33,540","06:35,860","\"The guy who looks like a tiger, he killed himself.\""]
["06:35,860","06:39,620","\"You said that and I thought it was a weird joke that you were making.\""]
["06:39,620","06:41,280","\"And then I looked it up and it was real.\""]
["06:41,280","06:43,640","\"No, it is real because that's the type...\""]
["06:43,640","06:44,860","\"I'm trying to draw a comparison.\""]
["06:44,860","06:47,060","\"If people look like this in the future, this looks cool.\""]
["06:47,060","06:49,620","\"But then once you actually look like this, you would want to kill yourself.\""]
["06:49,620","06:51,380","\"Because you're like, \"\"I'm a freak now.\"\"\""]
["06:51,380","06:53,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:53,180","06:56,060","\"But you would be a really cool freak until you killed yourself.\""]
["06:56,060","06:57,060","\"It's worth it.\""]
["06:57,060","07:01,020","\"Like up until the moment where you take your own life, you look fucking badass.\""]
["07:01,020","07:02,020","\"It's true.\""]
["07:02,020","07:05,300","\"Ah, this looks like GTA 2.\""]
["07:05,300","07:06,300","\"This sucks.\""]
["07:06,300","07:07,300","\"Turn it off.\""]
["07:07,300","07:09,300","\"No, I'm kidding.\""]
["07:09,300","07:12,620","\"It looks like a driver 3.\""]
["07:12,620","07:14,220","\"This game has actually aged pretty well.\""]
["07:14,220","07:16,060","\"I think it was like 2013 or something.\""]
["07:16,060","07:17,060","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:17,060","07:18,060","\"Yeah, no.\""]
["07:18,060","07:19,540","\"This has strong art direction.\""]
["07:19,540","07:20,540","\"He's got friends.\""]
["07:20,540","07:21,540","\"Kill him.\""]

["07:23,140","07:24,740","\"Oh, his high heels are still on.\""]
["07:24,740","07:25,740","\"They built into him.\""]
["07:25,740","07:27,020","\"Shmah!\""]
["07:27,020","07:28,860","\"That cost $2,000.\""]

["07:38,940","07:39,860","\"- Is that inappropriate?\""]
["07:39,860","07:44,340","\"- Oh, that wasn't even the sword.\""]
["07:44,340","07:45,340","\"That was just the sheath.\""]
["07:45,340","07:47,180","\"Where's his cool jaw?\""]
["07:47,180","07:49,820","\"- You'll see, Chris.\""]
["07:49,820","07:51,740","\"- We're gonna probably watch him lose his jaw\""]
["07:51,740","07:53,060","\"in this very scene.\""]
["07:53,060","07:56,660","\"Or maybe he just needs to chew gum more efficiently, Tomar.\""]
["07:56,660","08:00,100","\"In either case, it's time to fight.\""]
["08:00,100","08:01,620","\"I'm excited.\""]
["08:01,620","08:04,660","\"Oh, hell yeah.\""]
["08:04,660","08:05,940","\"He's got a scouter.\""]

["09:20,360","09:27,400","\"At least one of these guys would have a wife or something that would insist on an open casket funeral\""]
["09:27,400","09:32,400","\"You ever met people like that where it's like oh, yeah, my husband died in a horrible car accident\""]

["09:35,580","09:37,580","\"I've never dealt with that exact situation\""]
["09:37,580","09:42,560","\"I'm of the opinion that open casket is already like a sort of\""]
["09:43,120","09:46,720","\"an unhealthy thing for the grieving process.\""]

["10:00,500","10:04,080","\"to be found in looking at it other than just acknowledging,\""]

["10:09,920","10:12,240","\"- I think it helps some people, yeah.\""]
["10:12,240","10:15,600","\"And it's really normal in Ireland. I feel like I've been to like five or six.\""]
["10:15,600","10:18,560","\"Oh my God.\""]
["10:18,560","10:21,520","\"But you've never been to one where a guy got cut in half like that.\""]
