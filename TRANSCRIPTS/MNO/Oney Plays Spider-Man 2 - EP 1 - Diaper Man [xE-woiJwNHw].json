["01:33,880","01:35,880","\"Is this one of the best Spider-Man games?\""]
["01:35,880","01:37,880","\"This is the best Spider-Man game.\""]
["01:37,880","01:38,880","\"This is the best Spider-Man game.\""]
["01:38,880","01:40,880","\"How have they not topped it since then?\""]
["01:40,880","01:42,880","\"Because they don't fucking moor on air pretty much.\""]
["01:42,880","01:46,880","\"By the way, Toby Maguire is completely\""]
["01:46,880","01:49,880","\"emotionally checked out of this fucking role of this game.\""]
["01:49,880","01:50,880","\"That's what makes it so good.\""]
["01:50,880","01:54,100","\"Can I say I still think topiqwire is the best?\""]
["01:54,100","01:59,280","\"Peter Parker you think so I think so I think so the new guys. Okay. I'm Andrew Garfield\""]
["01:59,280","02:03,980","\"I thought he was the worst Andrew Garfield. Yeah, I didn't like him. He was pretty epic. Oh cool\""]

["02:18,180","02:23,980","\"I think is Peter Parker. I think I think is the best balance. I think I think Andrew Gullfield was a good spider-man\""]
["02:23,980","02:26,580","\"But a bad Peter Parker. I think I'm quite a bad\""]
["02:26,580","02:30,940","\"Peter tell me a lot is Peter Parker. This looks like a big fucking second batch potatoes\""]
["02:30,940","02:37,480","\"I feel like it's really hard to judge the the new Peter Parker because that that fucking movie just never shuts up\""]
