["00:33,000","00:36,720","\"That's like the essence of Kingdom Hearts.\""]
["00:36,720","00:41,400","\"It's just like linger on shots and try to make it seem deep when it's really just autistic.\""]
["00:41,400","00:44,880","\"Oh my god.\""]
["00:44,880","00:46,880","\"Oh no.\""]

["01:14,860","01:16,820","\"- Did they ever do a fighting game?\""]
["01:16,820","01:17,660","\"I don't think so.\""]
["01:17,660","01:18,880","\"- Why would Disney do that?\""]
["01:18,880","01:22,560","\"- 'Cause Cartoon Network did fucking, a PlayStation did.\""]
["01:22,560","01:24,760","\"Everybody wanted to be Smash Brothers.\""]
["01:24,760","01:27,900","\"- They had Disney infinity.\""]
["01:27,900","01:29,100","\"- Which accounts? - I guess that counts.\""]
["01:29,100","01:30,100","\"that failed.\""]
["01:30,100","01:31,620","\"- Yeah, it went for like six years.\""]

["01:40,940","01:42,100","\"- Is it?\""]
["01:42,100","01:44,860","\"- Well, they're like gross, like nasty pieces of shit\""]
["01:44,860","01:45,860","\"that you can put on your shelves.\""]
["01:45,860","01:46,700","\"- I am close.\""]
["01:46,700","01:47,540","\"- You hated how they love it.\""]
["01:47,540","01:48,380","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:48,380","01:49,100","\"- The other thing I was gonna say is I hate\""]

["01:58,920","02:03,480","\"I'm not gonna say the fact that he's not a fag. He's a dandy.\""]
["02:03,480","02:08,720","\"Let me go home. Captain Hook and only you.\""]
["02:08,720","02:12,280","\"He's just a little boy. Look at that scary tiger in the background. Oh, he's gone.\""]
["02:12,280","02:21,960","\"Well, at least fuck me then. Let's move. He's stupid. Chris,\""]

["02:30,080","02:31,080","\"You're up there.\""]
["02:31,080","02:33,400","\"I mean, she was touching his hair, too.\""]
["02:33,400","02:34,400","\"She was admiring him.\""]

["02:53,840","02:55,840","\"I'm not coming up with it on the spot.\""]
["02:55,840","02:58,880","\"Um, why don't you?\""]
["02:58,880","03:00,740","\"- Die? - Go.\""]
["03:00,740","03:01,940","\"- Go here. - To...\""]
["03:01,940","03:04,440","\"- The store. - The store.\""]
["03:04,440","03:07,340","\"Because I don't like spending money.\""]

["03:08,140","03:10,640","\"Kingdom Hearts.\""]
["03:10,640","03:13,240","\"I did once upon a time.\""]

["03:14,240","03:16,940","\"Oh, I want you to go back and get the Trinity.\""]
["03:16,940","03:17,840","\"Can you warp it?\""]
["03:17,840","03:19,440","\"Oh yeah, I can warp.\""]
["03:19,440","03:21,140","\"I forgot. We haven't played this in a while.\""]
["03:21,140","03:22,640","\"Are they just not gonna let me go?\""]
["03:23,540","03:24,580","\"Go to the war pole.\""]
["03:24,580","03:26,340","\"Let's try and see if I can actually do it.\""]
["03:26,340","03:27,340","\"Oh my god.\""]
["03:27,340","03:29,660","\"No, when you're discovering new places, you have to--\""]
["03:29,660","03:33,500","\"I mean, I know Monstro is going to happen, but--\""]
["03:33,500","03:34,460","\"Now this is Monstro?\""]
["03:34,460","03:36,660","\"Yeah, that's the next level that they're going to make us do.\""]
["03:36,660","03:38,060","\"I don't like that level.\""]
["03:38,060","03:38,940","\"I like how it looks.\""]
["03:38,940","03:41,180","\"I think it drags on for way too long.\""]
["03:41,180","03:43,260","\"I remember hating it.\""]
["03:43,260","03:45,860","\"This sandwich made me feel sick.\""]
["03:45,860","03:47,620","\"It's because you've got a weak ass tummy.\""]
["03:47,620","03:49,420","\"Didn't you have two sandwiches?\""]
["03:49,420","03:50,140","\"I ate that.\""]

["03:54,020","03:55,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:55,020","03:57,220","\"We had sandwiches today.\""]
["03:57,220","03:58,220","\"Yippee!\""]
["03:58,220","03:59,420","\"What's that?\""]
["03:59,420","04:00,820","\"That was the Whirlpool.\""]
["04:00,820","04:04,020","\"Fuck you, the Gummy Ship's the best part of the game.\""]
["04:04,020","04:05,020","\"The game.\""]
["04:05,020","04:06,420","\"This part of the game.\""]
["04:06,420","04:07,220","\"It's...\""]
["04:07,220","04:10,220","\"I like obviously it's so needlessly pointless.\""]

["04:11,820","04:13,620","\"You got all these colorful little bits.\""]
["04:13,620","04:15,820","\"You're not gonna die in a Gummy Ship.\""]
["04:15,820","04:19,420","\"Look, I just got car-bunkled.\""]
["04:19,420","04:21,620","\"I need to upgrade my Gummy Ship\""]
["04:21,620","04:25,900","\"So the enemies that don't do anything to me can also not do it even more.\""]
["04:25,900","04:26,400","\"[chuckles]\""]

["04:59,180","05:01,180","\"I'm a gummy gummy.\""]
["05:01,180","05:04,180","\"Maybe it's because I didn't go to Travelerstown.\""]
