["00:50,700","00:54,700","\"That guy... you're supposed to just trust something that looks like that?\""]
["00:54,700","00:55,900","\"*Laughs* I'm going back.\""]
["00:55,900","00:56,400","\"*Laughs*\""]
["00:56,400","00:58,400","\"Absolutely not\""]
["00:58,400","01:05,580","\"Get up you little dickhead. Am I playing as Ori? I think that's Ori\""]
["01:05,580","01:11,520","\"This job of the hunt\""]
["01:11,520","01:17,320","\"Oh, did you see that you did a little flip that was cool\""]
["01:23,560","01:25,560","\"Whoa, you can't say that\""]
["01:25,560","01:31,960","\"Can't show those and say that\""]
["01:31,960","01:34,640","\"What is that your dad?\""]
["01:34,640","01:39,400","\"Wait, what is this family dynamic going on? We never play I never played the first one\""]
["01:39,400","01:43,760","\"Yeah, that thing dies in the first one. I guess it doesn't I guess it undies\""]
["01:43,760","01:52,760","\"There's a second game - we named her cool wait hold on okay, so that's the biological child of that spider and\""]
["01:52,760","01:57,520","\"No face. I don't know. I think they just found it. Yeah, okay\""]
["01:57,520","02:04,480","\"I guess that's fair. So me and Tomar started this game for five minutes straight just to see if it recorded well because it's a\""]
["02:04,480","02:06,560","\"New computer, but um\""]
["02:06,560","02:11,560","\"We were saying that throughout this part. It's showing you, you know falling in love with this little owl and stuff\""]
["02:11,560","02:14,040","\"But it would have been better if they did it through gameplay\""]
["02:14,040","02:21,800","\"Yeah, probably I mean any time you build a relationship with another character through gameplay\""]
["02:21,800","02:29,140","\"It's always a little bit better because nine times out of ten and maybe this is changing because people are more like\""]
["02:29,140","02:31,320","\"\"\"Ooh, video games, I want to get invested in this story!\"\"\""]
["02:31,320","02:39,420","\"But nine times out of ten, especially with kids, you don't really care if the character doesn't have any impact on gameplay or anything like that.\""]
["02:39,420","02:44,700","\"So if you lose something that actually has been helping you, you're like \"\"No, I want it back!\"\"\""]
["02:44,700","02:47,900","\"You know, even if you don't really give a shit about what's going on.\""]
["02:47,900","02:50,500","\"It's because it plays into your mechanics to have more fun.\""]
["02:50,500","02:51,200","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:51,200","02:55,000","\"That said, I don't know if there is a mechanic designed around the owl.\""]
["02:55,000","02:58,200","\"There could have been though. We were saying that he could like let you glide for a bit.\""]
["02:58,200","03:03,200","\"I mean, there still could be. We don't actually know what the game is like past the first five to ten minutes.\""]
["03:03,200","03:05,200","\"I'm just assuming he's gonna get kidnapped.\""]
["03:05,200","03:07,200","\"I still think this thing is gonna betray you.\""]
["03:07,200","03:11,200","\"You think that dark evil fucking monster is gonna betray me?\""]
["03:11,200","03:13,200","\"Like evil spider monster with no pupils.\""]
["03:13,200","03:15,200","\"I think that...\""]
["03:15,200","03:19,200","\"That is doing this game's equivalent of what we do to cattle\""]
["03:19,200","03:23,080","\"Where it's just raising you up to get fatter like that thing\""]
["03:23,080","03:25,600","\"And it's gonna eat all of you. I\""]
["03:25,600","03:28,720","\"Like the music a lot. It's very pretty\""]
["03:28,720","03:31,960","\"Maybe you meet that thing in the last game and it's your friend\""]
["03:31,960","03:37,140","\"It probably like chases you for a second and then it becomes friendly\""]
["03:37,140","03:43,360","\"Yeah, cuz wait in the first game isn't there like a big owl chasing you the third game isn't it?\""]
["03:43,360","03:49,040","\"No, this is a second game. Okay. I thought there was one between Ori and the blind forest and this for some reason\""]
["03:49,040","03:55,200","\"Yeah, I did play maybe two hours of Ori and the Blind Forest and it was fine\""]
["03:55,200","04:02,680","\"It didn't upset me, but it didn't do anything that that's really that sounds identical to my experience\""]
["04:02,680","04:04,200","\"Yeah, I played it for a little bit\""]
["04:04,200","04:07,720","\"I'm like this is kind of sort of like a Metroidvania thing and I'm not super feeling it\""]
["04:07,720","04:10,920","\"I really liked Hollow Knight though, which was kind of along the same lines\""]
["04:10,920","04:16,480","\"Yeah, no I'm with you there the first time I played Hollow Knight even like I didn't really realize what I was doing\""]
["04:16,480","04:20,560","\"and I played it for like 15 minutes and then was like alright this is nice and I\""]
["04:20,560","04:25,300","\"stopped but then I picked it up another time and then played it for like two\""]
["04:25,300","04:30,400","\"weeks straight yeah it's like one of my favorite games now Hollow Knight yeah\""]
["04:30,400","04:37,860","\"ah they pet the owl and then kicked it out he's gonna fucked up Nemo Wing\""]
["04:37,860","04:42,800","\"Nemo Wing yeah oh yeah he's defective oh like finding Nemo they're sending it\""]
["04:42,800","04:45,800","\"back to the factory. They bought a bad one.\""]

["04:50,960","04:54,200","\"Is that just a congenital thing?\""]
["04:54,200","04:56,240","\"There was no backstory as to why his\""]
["04:56,240","04:58,360","\"general thing. Yeah, that's how they hump.\""]
["04:58,360","05:01,000","\"I meant like he was born with it.\""]
["05:01,000","05:03,040","\"Oh, look at the face on the black dude.\""]
["05:03,040","05:04,400","\"I was born with it too.\""]
["05:04,400","05:05,880","\"The dude of color, but yeah.\""]
["05:05,880","05:09,360","\"Yeah, I guess he's more of a colorful man.\""]
["05:09,360","05:11,480","\"He's a rotund monster of color.\""]
["05:11,480","05:12,480","\"Yeah.\""]

["05:31,480","05:34,240","\"Hey, watch out, those geese fuck things.\""]
["05:34,240","05:35,240","\"See?\""]
["05:35,240","05:37,120","\"Those are birds and they swim.\""]
["05:37,120","05:38,120","\"Maybe you can swim.\""]
["05:38,120","05:41,160","\"I'll shove you in, just to prove it to you.\""]
["05:41,160","05:46,160","\"They're like really nicely blending the music together too.\""]
["05:46,160","05:50,160","\"So are you just sad because it can't fly?\""]
["05:50,160","05:52,160","\"Yeah, he's got a stupid wing.\""]
["05:52,160","05:53,160","\"Oh.\""]
["05:53,160","05:58,160","\"He's really chapping his ass.\""]
["05:58,160","06:00,160","\"But Ori feels bad.\""]
["06:00,160","06:03,160","\"Ori hasn't been able to fly his whole goddamn life.\""]
["06:03,160","06:05,160","\"Yeah, that's fair.\""]
["06:05,160","06:08,160","\"If any gameplay would have been a lot easier if he could.\""]
["06:08,160","06:09,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:09,160","06:12,920","\"*Music*\""]
["06:12,920","06:19,160","\"Before he break his stupid wing. I can't believe he'll let me off myself right now. I can't believe\""]
["06:19,160","06:25,960","\"it doesn't let you pluck all the feathers out of that bird's face. This is so pretty, it's like\""]
["06:25,960","06:31,160","\"the movie Avatar. Alright, you got this. Bro, where's this slide around on your ass button, dude?\""]
["06:31,160","06:36,600","\"A better video game would have a slide around on your ass button. You're so right.\""]
["06:38,200","06:40,200","\"or mother spinal gear\""]
["06:40,200","06:45,720","\"Mother wait I go down there. Yeah, you just opened that by hanging on that row. Yeah\""]

["06:52,520","06:59,640","\"He looks like he controls a lot better than the first game people told me that in the first game he controls amazingly he controls okay\""]
["06:59,640","07:06,520","\"I don't I don't recall it being anything special. I also remember him taking up a weird amount of space on the screen roast feather\""]
["07:06,680","07:08,020","\"Okay, now you can fly.\""]
["07:08,020","07:10,500","\"I can go back and rock idiot.\""]

["07:12,400","07:15,320","\"That stupid dumbass never thought of finding a feather in a chest.\""]
["07:15,320","07:17,120","\"Well, he doesn't have fingers to grab it.\""]
["07:17,120","07:21,560","\"I take back what I said about the gliding around the L earlier.\""]
["07:21,560","07:24,560","\"Or he's like, Hey, I've been holding out on you.\""]
["07:24,560","07:26,040","\"I've had this the whole time.\""]
["07:26,040","07:27,800","\"This is cool, but it's mine.\""]
["07:27,800","07:29,080","\"I just want you to know that.\""]
["07:29,080","07:30,440","\"Are we going to buy?\""]

["07:31,840","07:35,240","\"I'm going to shove it up his ass.\""]
["07:35,240","07:40,100","\"Is this from your mommy?\""]
["07:40,100","07:43,200","\"Your mother gave birth to this instead of you.\""]
["07:43,200","07:44,200","\"What?\""]
["07:44,200","07:46,960","\"And she's raising it.\""]
["07:46,960","07:49,760","\"She's still alive and well right now.\""]
["07:49,760","07:52,240","\"Are they gonna create a hang glider out of that?\""]
["07:52,240","07:54,000","\"They're gonna tape it to him.\""]
["07:54,000","07:57,400","\"They're gonna repair him like how to train your dragon.\""]
["07:57,400","07:59,560","\"Nor he has to ride him?\""]
["07:59,560","08:00,560","\"I guess.\""]
["08:00,560","08:04,440","\"At this point, you've seen as much of this as I have.\""]
["08:04,440","08:05,440","\"Okay.\""]
["08:05,440","08:08,600","\"Oh, look, they're so happy.\""]

["08:13,400","08:15,080","\"Plug this into the owl.\""]
["08:15,080","08:16,080","\"What?\""]
["08:16,080","08:18,280","\"You want me to do what?\""]

["08:20,280","08:28,400","\"Go real a tape.\""]
["08:28,400","08:32,960","\"I could have done that at any time, meh.\""]

["08:35,640","08:37,480","\"Oh my god, we were so wrong.\""]
["08:37,480","08:38,480","\"You asshole!\""]
["08:38,480","08:40,960","\"You do get to fly around with it.\""]
["08:40,960","08:41,960","\"Dude!\""]
["08:41,960","08:43,960","\"No, I'm not wrong, I'm still right.\""]
["08:43,960","08:47,600","\"I just made the mistake of trusting my two friends.\""]
["08:47,600","08:51,440","\"I still think they shouldn't tell the story through not playing it.\""]
["08:51,440","08:53,160","\"But it seems like they are.\""]
["08:53,160","08:54,160","\"Would you want to know they are?\""]
["08:54,160","08:55,160","\"Like there was actually like...\""]
["08:55,160","08:56,160","\"What do you want there?\""]
["08:56,160","08:58,680","\"Press X to frown at the corner of a lake?\""]
["08:58,680","08:59,680","\"What?\""]
["08:59,680","09:03,540","\"This game fucking rocks\""]
["09:03,540","09:06,700","\"Look at this\""]
["09:06,700","09:11,580","\"See I can flap and I can tap they made it they made it good. Yeah\""]
["09:11,580","09:19,500","\"Can this thing wall jumper now the sky was within reach they're gonna they're gonna do exactly what we talked about\""]
["09:19,500","09:22,860","\"But now his idiot friend was on his back. Oh\""]
["09:22,860","09:27,060","\"No, he's coming back up\""]
["09:27,060","09:29,260","\"Yeah, look at that\""]
["09:29,260","09:35,580","\"So now you have this awesome flying companion that you're gonna get to play with for another five minutes\""]
["09:35,580","09:38,300","\"Yes, they're gonna kill him and then he's gonna get kidnapped\""]
["09:38,300","09:41,940","\"Probably by an evil witch\""]
["09:41,940","09:48,300","\"That fucking better not what if a good witch gives him a hug Tomar and then you play as him the whole game\""]
["09:48,300","09:51,180","\"I'm not trusting any of your predictions now\""]
["09:51,180","09:56,420","\"You get to go to the rave in the cave\""]
["09:57,380","09:59,380","\"Can you believe it?\""]
["09:59,380","10:05,040","\"By the way, I still stand by my point. This is cool and all but it would be better if we were playing through a fun-ass level\""]
["10:05,040","10:11,160","\"Oh, yeah, a good flying level on this would probably make this more exciting. It's a good alternative to a flying level\""]
["10:11,160","10:16,840","\"I'm like too safe as I do. I know but then you don't need all this. That's what I'm saying. That's it point taken\""]
["10:16,840","10:22,720","\"I wish I could sing like a while. Yeah, I mean\""]
["10:25,940","10:28,340","\"That's the lonely mountain from the movie the Hobbit\""]
["10:28,340","10:36,500","\"Wow there it goes all traces of the movie the Hobbit\""]
["10:36,500","10:40,060","\"Go down there. Oh\""]
["10:40,060","10:45,500","\"Goose he's gonna do that thing from Avatar where he jumps off and steps the big thing with his hair\""]
["10:45,500","10:50,500","\"And then it believes him when it would it would it would he lies to it?\""]
["10:54,500","10:57,620","\"Uh oh, see now they're part of a goose formation.\""]
["10:57,620","10:58,620","\"Da evil.\""]
["10:58,620","11:09,580","\"What if it gets struck by lightning?\""]
["11:09,580","11:14,180","\"Well, I feel like they're placing a little too much confidence\""]
["11:14,180","11:16,940","\"in this just repaired wing.\""]
["11:16,940","11:19,700","\"Yeah, they're being kind of stupid.\""]
