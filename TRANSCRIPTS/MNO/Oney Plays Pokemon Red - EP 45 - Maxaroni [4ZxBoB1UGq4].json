["15:33,740","15:37,820","\"you're using people should have a crash course and how to act online and go on it\""]
["15:37,820","15:42,820","\"as well as I say it's like watching like you know our rated movies or whatever\""]
["15:42,820","15:46,420","\"that you should you should ideally I think you should have a parent with them\""]
["15:46,420","15:51,840","\"Yeah, like it's also dependent. I'm just like how mature are you?\""]
["15:51,840","15:58,860","\"That's true. That's true for a person to person basis like I think people letting their kids go online and just being like have at it\""]
["15:58,860","16:01,360","\"That's really not a good idea because they don't know\""]
["16:01,360","16:04,860","\"Like you know when the first time you get trolled online it like\""]
["16:04,860","16:15,220","\"Not the way you're supposed to react to it you're supposed to just like completely ignore it and like that's do you think that's happened that\""]
