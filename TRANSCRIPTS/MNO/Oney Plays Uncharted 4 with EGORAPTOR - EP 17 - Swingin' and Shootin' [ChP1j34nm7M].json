["00:35,600","00:41,220","\"Faded into the Netherlands dude the Netherlands. I mean the nether world\""]
["00:41,220","00:49,920","\"This game would really benefit from being able to like fuck with the environment like like pull it apart and like mess with the physics of it and shit\""]
["00:49,920","00:56,100","\"Yeah, anything you could use that in combat. That'd be great. Yeah, like like you could throw your rope upon fucking\""]
["00:56,360","01:00,660","\"You know pillars and pull them down on people that be fucking rad dude\""]
["01:00,660","01:05,260","\"Do you mean like what bio-shock infinite was supposed to be I never played any bio-shock game\""]

["01:16,060","01:21,040","\"Oh my god, and then it came out and it was it was like half of what they promised and everyone's alike\""]
["01:21,040","01:23,520","\"Dude, it's amazing dude\""]
["01:23,520","01:27,220","\"Dude, and then after like six months or so, people were like,\""]

["01:29,000","01:31,360","\"- Yeah, another year later, everyone's like, \"\"Oh, it's so boring.\"\"\""]
["01:31,360","01:32,600","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:32,600","01:35,240","\"It's like I would never play Bioshock Infinite.\""]
["01:35,240","01:38,560","\"- I watched the Mathers' Matosas think about it.\""]
["01:38,560","01:41,160","\"Old Mathers, Matthew Matosas.\""]
["01:41,160","01:45,400","\"- He said that the game designed the weapon system\""]
["01:45,400","01:48,800","\"brokenly, so the entire game is like fucking stupid.\""]
["01:48,800","01:50,800","\"They allow you to upgrade your weapons,\""]
["01:50,800","01:52,840","\"but when you upgrade them, that means you gotta stick to them,\""]
["01:52,840","01:54,920","\"And then that means you can't pick up ammo when you find it\""]
["01:54,920","01:56,840","\"'cause it never suits the weapon you upgraded.\""]
["01:56,840","01:58,960","\"So you'll always have to throw away your upgraded weapon.\""]
["01:58,960","02:00,840","\"- That's like one of the many shitty things.\""]
["02:00,840","02:03,920","\"Also like the way that they designed like exploring stuff\""]
["02:03,920","02:06,000","\"and getting weapons is you just like go along\""]
["02:06,000","02:09,000","\"every single fucking desk or floor\""]
["02:09,000","02:11,400","\"and just keep pressing X over and over and over again.\""]
["02:11,400","02:14,040","\"So like they design these beautiful worlds\""]
["02:14,040","02:15,800","\"with like this fucking inherent storyline.\""]
["02:15,800","02:18,200","\"And all you're doing is looking down at fucking tables\""]
["02:18,200","02:19,360","\"just like trying to get items.\""]
["02:19,360","02:20,320","\"- I'm so immersed.\""]
["02:20,320","02:22,480","\"- And then the environment tells the story like great,\""]
["02:22,480","02:24,480","\"Why don't you just make a game where you're fucking walking around?\""]
["02:24,480","02:26,480","\"It's like who cares?\""]
["02:26,480","02:30,960","\"People, if that's what, that's literally everything that everybody liked about that game was like dude\""]
["02:30,960","02:34,920","\"It's so beautiful and like the environments and it's like alright. We'll just make that then\""]
["02:34,920","02:38,240","\"Did he see me? Why waste the time making fucking guns shit?\""]
["02:38,240","02:44,960","\"Because that's what sells dude. It's not what everyone wanted about it. He saw me through the tall grass. I can't see him\""]
["02:44,960","02:46,880","\"That's not fair. Come on\""]
["02:46,880","02:48,880","\"Hello, I can't see\""]
["02:50,080","02:52,080","\"Oh, you can grab when he gets close this cool\""]
["02:52,080","02:58,980","\"The thing was about Bioshock Infinite is they wanted to make this this sort of like story about um\""]
["02:58,980","03:02,040","\"about like different factions and like this sort of\""]
["03:02,040","03:06,280","\"You discover that you're like this guy that they're looking for and shit\""]
["03:06,280","03:11,080","\"Mm-hmm, but like the game has nothing you're just shooting dudes like there's nothing to do with that in the game\""]
["03:11,080","03:15,080","\"Holy shit dude, what's that supposed to?\""]
["03:18,080","03:22,600","\"Mean that I'm a grab and grab it really looks like I'm supposed to climb it\""]
