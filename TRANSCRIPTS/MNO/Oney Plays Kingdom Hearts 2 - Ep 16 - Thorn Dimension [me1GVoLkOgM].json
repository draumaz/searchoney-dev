["04:09,600","04:15,400","\"a few times or it started off small where we have a glass of water and we drop it on drunk people on a Saturday night\""]
["04:15,400","04:16,640","\"and they would never\""]
["04:16,640","04:20,640","\"want to deal with it because it's just too much effort after getting drunk they just want to go home\""]

["04:45,420","04:49,060","\"Yeah, but there was one night when there was a bunch of girls\""]
["04:49,060","04:54,660","\"They were all dressed in pink and wearing like rabbit ears and being really loud and stupid and\""]
["04:54,660","04:57,100","\"Then we got the basin\""]
