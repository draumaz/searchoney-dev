["02:26,600","02:29,600","\"You just 100% hate it.\""]
["02:29,600","02:30,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:30,600","02:33,600","\"There's jokes here and there that are funny,\""]
["02:33,600","02:35,600","\"but overall it's very hard to sit through.\""]
["02:35,600","02:39,600","\"I give it a lot of points just because I like the concept so much,\""]
["02:39,600","02:40,600","\"but I think a lot of it is-\""]
["02:40,600","02:42,600","\"Also, I think the movie did a great job shutting down.\""]
["02:42,600","02:44,600","\"A lot of it is really unfunny.\""]
["02:44,600","02:46,600","\"The movie is the worst shit I've ever seen in my life.\""]
["02:46,600","02:47,600","\"The movie is-\""]
["02:47,600","02:48,600","\"I finally watched it.\""]

["02:50,600","02:51,600","\"No, you should have told me.\""]

["02:54,600","02:55,600","\"Do you want to watch it again?\""]
["02:55,600","03:02,600","\"I don't like people who relentlessly shit on things, but that movie relentlessly shits on South Park for no reason and how it badly\""]
["03:02,600","03:08,600","\"There is a reason no no no it is no reason because they say you should be offensive with no reason\""]
["03:08,600","03:15,200","\"Oh, yeah, that's true. There you go. That's their complaint with South Park is it's popular because there's a point and you shouldn't have a party\""]
["03:15,200","03:17,500","\"They're like they put in stupid morals\""]
["03:17,500","03:24,720","\"It's also what makes comedy like that work what I always appreciated about especially the older South Park's is there was a\""]
["03:24,720","03:29,480","\"Well, I mean also part, but especially the older South Park. I like the I like the older South Park\""]
["03:29,480","03:32,360","\"Personally better well\""]
["03:32,360","03:35,360","\"Old South Park was a lot of fun because I also just focused on the kids a lot of the time\""]
["03:35,360","03:41,520","\"Yeah, I like before I liked it before they got into the like oh what's the current topic of the week?\""]
["03:41,520","03:47,040","\"That's all they start last season was fucking terrible. That's what I hear. I haven't seen it\""]
["03:47,040","03:49,460","\"It's because they also didn't know what they were doing with it anymore\""]
["03:49,460","03:52,640","\"I haven't watched it since funny Cthulhu cardman episode\""]
["03:52,640","03:58,200","\"I remember that and I was very unhappy about it. I was like okay. I'm done now. It's pretty bad. I\""]
["03:58,200","04:03,000","\"Remember I that was I was in high school when that air is I remember\""]
["04:03,000","04:08,560","\"Coming in and talking to someone about they're like yeah, it was pretty bad. I don't watch it anymore\""]

["04:16,920","04:19,000","\"But I actually like some episodes in the first season\""]
["04:19,000","04:21,880","\"- It seems like four and five are my favorite.\""]
["04:21,880","04:24,280","\"- I think even season two has a lot of fun episodes.\""]
["04:24,280","04:25,920","\"I think just right out the door,\""]
["04:25,920","04:27,720","\"they're having a lot of fun with it.\""]
["04:27,720","04:29,480","\"It's fun to go back and watch.\""]

["04:30,320","04:32,120","\"- I like that sound.\""]
["04:32,120","04:33,840","\"It's actually really satisfying.\""]

["04:36,360","04:37,200","\"of Southbury.\""]
["04:37,200","04:38,040","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:38,040","04:39,440","\"- They have fat abbit.\""]

["04:53,600","04:56,080","\"Fuck you, you fucking bitch.\""]
["04:56,080","05:00,320","\"Season 8 was like my favorite season when I was a teenager.\""]
["05:00,320","05:04,080","\"I think that's where it started turning to the second half of it.\""]
["05:04,080","05:06,640","\"It was when it started just becoming current events.\""]
["05:06,640","05:09,400","\"Well, the good times what happens when it was really good.\""]
["05:09,400","05:10,400","\"Yeah, no.\""]
["05:10,400","05:12,720","\"I felt the same exact way as at the beginning of Season 8.\""]
["05:12,720","05:16,640","\"I was actually liking it a lot and then the second half started airing and that was the\""]
["05:16,640","05:17,640","\"Walmart episode.\""]
["05:17,640","05:22,600","\"Did they do the thing about when did they do the thing about how Cartman goes to the future and it's\""]
["05:22,600","05:27,520","\"That was a good turning cuz that's so that's what I would say is when I was like, okay\""]
["05:27,520","05:30,920","\"That's enough for me. I just remember I started hating it went well not hating it\""]
["05:30,920","05:35,960","\"I didn't care about it. I didn't like it when I noticed the pattern of Randy Marsh becoming the main character for every episode\""]
["05:35,960","05:40,960","\"I was frustrated at\""]
["05:41,360","05:44,320","\"He used to be this fucking normal dad and I liked him that way\""]
["05:44,320","05:50,920","\"It was the funny. He was funny too because he had really monotone delivery and everything. Yeah, he was like stupid equals\""]
["05:50,920","05:56,120","\"I like the episode where they're getting a divorce because he just he he calls his wife a cunt\""]
["05:56,120","05:58,440","\"And she said you just called me a con you went and did\""]
["05:58,440","06:06,440","\"More was the guy with only three characters why that happened every show family guy did it too where they just start killing off their whole cast\""]
["06:06,440","06:08,120","\"Yeah, I\""]
["06:08,120","06:13,800","\"Hate I was telling Jimmy and I hate fucking caratman. I like the one he got like picked on a bullied for being an asshole\""]
["06:13,800","06:18,760","\"Yeah, I was the point. Yeah, I dropped it now. He's just I'm cool, and I'm horrible\""]
["06:18,760","06:24,760","\"That was because of the Scott tennerman episode that they just decide okay. Let's just do this with him now\""]
["06:24,760","06:30,520","\"Yeah, but at the same time it's because he's punishing another character who shittier than him which is why it works in that episode\""]
["06:30,520","06:34,440","\"They build him up to be such an asshole\""]
["06:36,200","06:43,160","\"Because he's cool that that was stupid to the cartoon war is episode of family guy and everything is that Bart Simpson appears\""]
["06:43,160","06:48,360","\"I was like, oh, yeah, what did you do? It's like I stole the head of the statue. Yeah, well, I\""]

["06:54,560","06:57,920","\"You're really cool. It's the same thing is the the family guy\""]
["06:57,920","07:03,020","\"Cross over where it's doing gets to prove that he's more badass than Bart is by saying\""]
["07:03,320","07:09,120","\"Mo's gonna get raped and then bar goes well, man. You're cool. You're too far for me. I\""]

["07:19,720","07:25,120","\"I was just like at these\""]
["07:25,120","07:33,300","\"Like that I like that episode the family got cross over I don't I do because I just imagined so many people getting mad\""]
["07:33,300","07:35,300","\"when they start fighting each other.\""]
["07:35,300","07:38,300","\"- I hated to because the whole thing you could tell\""]
["07:38,300","07:40,300","\"it's written by Suffolk-Farland's team\""]
["07:40,300","07:43,300","\"because it's focused on the idea like,\""]
["07:43,300","07:45,300","\"\"\"Actually, you all call us a ripoff,\""]
["07:45,300","07:47,300","\"but remember the Flintstones?\"\"\""]
["07:47,300","07:51,300","\"And it's like, okay, that's never, no one fucking cares.\""]
["07:51,300","07:53,300","\"Also, the Flintstones is completely different.\""]
["07:53,300","07:55,300","\"It's obvious what's going on with Family Guy and the Simpsons.\""]
["07:55,300","07:57,300","\"It's a lot closer of a comparison\""]
["07:57,300","07:59,300","\"than the Flintstones and the Simpsons.\""]
["07:59,300","08:00,300","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:00,300","08:02,300","\"- There's been other, like, yeah, the Flintstones\""]
["08:02,300","08:06,600","\"is like probably the first example of a show like that but at the same time well\""]
["08:06,600","08:10,820","\"not even as the fucking honeymooners well I know that's that's what the Flintstones\""]
["08:10,820","08:14,980","\"is based off but the first animated show to be doing that oh yeah that's fair\""]
["08:14,980","08:18,560","\"enough which is what the argument is in that episode but it's like calm the fuck\""]
["08:18,560","08:23,980","\"down like why is this the premise of this crossover I like the ask an episode of\""]
["08:23,980","08:29,580","\"so far I do too it's a fun little crime stoppers I think that was one of the\""]
["08:29,580","08:33,580","\"a few times that when they, 'cause they fell into that formula with every new episode\""]
["08:33,580","08:36,740","\"is, let's take small event and blow it out of proportion.\""]
["08:36,740","08:39,180","\"- Yeah, so that it's like, oh, it's so--\""]
["08:39,180","08:43,940","\"- No, Crime Stoppers is fun because they aren't doing anything.\""]
["08:43,940","08:48,140","\"Everyone is just killing themselves and taking it too seriously outside of them.\""]
["08:48,140","08:52,900","\"- The episode I noticed that fucking formula of something stupid is happening, let's blow\""]
["08:52,900","08:57,220","\"it up into a war-like scenario with Epic Music was the Jersey Shore episode.\""]
["08:57,220","08:58,220","\"That really--\""]
["08:58,220","09:00,700","\"- I don't think I even saw that one.\""]
["09:00,700","09:01,980","\"- By the way, a lot of these episodes\""]
["09:01,980","09:04,020","\"are just not going to ever be watched again\""]
["09:04,020","09:06,060","\"because they're not timeless.\""]
["09:06,060","09:08,860","\"They were written just, I keep mentioning it.\""]
["09:08,860","09:11,340","\"They had an episode based on the royal wedding.\""]

["09:29,500","09:31,820","\"- Not only that, but the episode didn't even make any sense.\""]
["09:31,820","09:32,660","\"It was like, no.\""]
["09:32,660","09:36,140","\"- Jersey, New Jersey are coming to kill us. Why?\""]
["09:36,140","09:38,060","\"- Because Jersey Shore is funny.\""]
["09:38,060","09:41,340","\"That's what they do with everything.\""]
["09:41,340","09:42,660","\"It's always like that too.\""]
