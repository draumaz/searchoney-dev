["02:44,280","02:50,040","\"This looks just like sound Nick would they get mad they'd look you dead in the eye and they'd like start visibly sweating and getting angry\""]
["02:50,040","02:52,040","\"I kind of did that at a convention one time\""]
["02:52,800","02:57,160","\"There was a guy showing off a game that looked just like Minecraft and I said hey, it's just looks just like Minecraft\""]
["02:57,160","02:59,160","\"I got really mad at me. Yeah\""]
["02:59,160","03:03,580","\"It was really funny. He's probably heard it like a million times\""]
["03:03,580","03:08,220","\"No, I didn't even this was back when I had no self-awareness and I like it was one of my first cons\""]
["03:08,220","03:12,300","\"So I was all excited and wanted to talk to people was Minecraft pretty new at the time\""]
["03:12,300","03:17,860","\"Like what was it a situation where he could have started this before Minecraft came out and then minecraft came out\""]
["03:17,860","03:22,240","\"And the guy was like clearly like fuck yeah, maybe no no this guy was clearly\""]
["03:22,320","03:26,440","\"he inspired by minecraft is no fucking way he wasn't he was a good guy why can't you\""]
["03:26,440","03:31,440","\"hurt him oh yeah maybe good me oh no he's one of these guys definitely charge attack\""]
["03:31,440","03:40,800","\"him what you yeah beat him up yeah weak but yeah no that guy was just being a pussy this\""]
["03:40,800","03:47,040","\"is clearly mad because he's heard it so many times then I'm glad you stumbled awkwardly\""]
["03:47,040","03:50,600","\"into a certain social situation that hurt his feelings I was just trying to like make\""]
["03:50,600","03:53,440","\"- I was stupid, but yeah, it was funny.\""]
["03:53,440","03:56,820","\"- You know what, people could choose to get offended\""]
["03:56,820","03:58,440","\"by that or they can just be like,\""]
["03:58,440","04:00,480","\"okay, this is a kid, that makes sense.\""]
["04:00,480","04:01,640","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:01,640","04:04,880","\"- Yeah, it is like Minecraft, except you could try\""]
["04:04,880","04:07,120","\"to educate this child on the differences.\""]
["04:07,120","04:09,720","\"- I wasn't a kid, I was like fucking 20 something.\""]
["04:09,720","04:12,360","\"- Yeah, this little tiny kid.\""]
["04:12,360","04:13,800","\"- This little tiny kid.\""]
["04:13,800","04:15,240","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:15,240","04:17,840","\"- I feel like people get weirdly defensive,\""]
["04:17,840","04:22,400","\"Like if they're clearly inspired by something, but they don't want to admit that they are\""]
["04:22,400","04:28,960","\"It's like fine. Like if you're inspired by something and you just go, \"\"Oh yeah, like I really like this and I wanted to put a spin on it.\"\"\""]
["04:28,960","04:30,240","\"Like that's that's alright.\""]
["04:30,240","04:30,880","\"Ooh!\""]
["04:30,880","04:34,000","\"No, yeah, he could have literally just been like, \"\"Yeah, but here's what's different.\"\"\""]
["04:34,000","04:34,720","\"That's it.\""]
["04:34,720","04:35,200","\"But he didn't.\""]
["04:35,200","04:37,840","\"Anyway, fuck that guy.\""]
["04:37,840","04:41,360","\"It's always easier to take offense than to fucking think like a human being.\""]
["04:41,360","04:42,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:42,080","04:46,240","\"Also, maybe he did that to like confuse you into being like,\""]
["04:46,240","04:48,240","\"No, this is the original game\""]
["04:48,240","04:52,360","\"Maybe then you're like it's 2006 and I'm amazed dude\""]
["04:52,360","04:57,720","\"This is cool because actually like you know most of these Sonic 3d games like it just steers you everywhere\""]
["04:57,720","05:00,360","\"But this you actually have to do everything yourself, which is quite nice\""]
["05:00,360","05:08,000","\"Look like if I hit the wall here, it's gonna fuck me. So I gotta actually aim myself see yeah awesome. Yeah, whoo\""]
["05:08,000","05:11,280","\"Who would have thought\""]
["05:11,680","05:15,000","\"Not Sonic guys have you seen that sonic demo where it actually looks really cool\""]
["05:15,000","05:19,260","\"But it was like a fan made game do a sick kickflip are you talking about I've seen a few of them\""]
["05:19,260","05:21,260","\"It's like one that looked a lot like\""]
["05:21,260","05:27,340","\"You know sonic CD, you know the sonic boom opening. Yeah, I saw one that looked a lot like that\""]
["05:27,340","05:30,040","\"Oh, that yeah, I saw that one recently is that the one you're talking about?\""]
["05:30,040","05:34,040","\"No, I'm talking about like where it's like he's running around Green Hills own\""]
["05:34,040","05:35,600","\"But it's like a massive open area\""]
["05:35,600","05:41,280","\"But like it looks so fun to control and he thought of everything to make it more fun like its adventure style\""]
["05:41,280","05:48,980","\"No, it's like its own thing. Oh, okay. Yeah, maybe we could try playing that as men in terms of like is it like 3d like\""]
["05:48,980","05:50,240","\"Yeah, it's fully 3d\""]
["05:50,240","05:54,540","\"3d person it's pretty much just like this except there's a lot more movement things you can do and\""]
["05:54,540","06:01,320","\"It's got like a trancy green hill zone remix. Were you ever really into Sonic? I used to love\""]
["06:01,320","06:07,580","\"Suck adventure - when I was younger. That's pretty much it. I had Sonic one on the Sega mega drive\""]
["06:07,880","06:10,940","\"Yeah, I was never like the biggest sonic fan in the world\""]
["06:10,940","06:13,160","\"But I did have sonic adventure - and I was like yeah\""]
["06:13,160","06:16,340","\"This is pretty okay, and then I got a couple of them after that and they weren't very good\""]
["06:16,340","06:21,580","\"Yeah, I was like this is still okay because I was a dumb kid and I tried Sonic Heroes as a kid and I was like this sucks\""]
["06:21,580","06:26,500","\"Yes, Sonic Heroes was weird because they gave all the enemies like health bars and you just had to keep like\""]
["06:26,500","06:30,120","\"Smacking them. Yeah, I remember I never played here\""]
["06:30,120","06:34,860","\"I know Sonic Adventure 2 is not very good, but it's still enjoyable. I played\""]
["06:34,860","06:38,860","\"I got my dreamcast for my bar mitzvah\""]
["06:38,860","06:41,860","\"and so my first game was Sonic Adventure\""]
["06:41,860","06:43,860","\"and I thought it was the coolest thing ever.\""]
["06:43,860","06:45,860","\"- So Sonic Worlds, I think, are still fun,\""]
["06:45,860","06:47,860","\"but yeah, a lot of it doesn't hold up.\""]
["06:47,860","06:50,860","\"It doesn't hold up, but at the time, it was something really new.\""]
["06:50,860","06:52,860","\"- Yeah, no, like the fact that even that Sonic\""]
["06:52,860","06:56,860","\"was doing like an overworld and the chow mini game\""]
["06:56,860","06:58,860","\"was really cool with the VMUs.\""]
["06:58,860","07:02,860","\"- I had a friend that was really, really into the chow garden\""]
["07:02,860","07:04,860","\"and he didn't have the game so we would just like\""]
["07:04,860","07:08,860","\"come over to my house and raise this fucking chow and then it died.\""]
["07:08,860","07:12,860","\"Oh no. You can kill him. I thought they just run away.\""]
["07:12,860","07:15,860","\"Well, I don't know. They go into like a cocoon and disappear.\""]
["07:15,860","07:20,860","\"Yeah, really? They do have like a death that they don't call death, but yeah, they can die.\""]
["07:20,860","07:23,860","\"Like a Tamagotchi. Yeah. Wow. Oh yeah, I forgot.\""]
["07:23,860","07:29,860","\"So, yeah, that homing attack is throw me off because in Sonic, it's the same button as jump.\""]
["07:29,860","07:36,420","\"jump. Is this the end? Wow. No, you're in the sea. Look, I'm a jester and I'm running\""]
["07:36,420","07:40,340","\"around in the sea. What was this? I'm just gonna come out and say it. This game is kind\""]
["07:40,340","07:45,140","\"of silly. If you use your thunder attack underwater, does it like electrify everything?\""]
["07:45,140","07:50,100","\"Like in Pokemon? No? Alright. No. I guess Pokemon's bullshit. Maybe the power of friendship ain't\""]
["07:50,100","07:56,660","\"that much after all. Pokemon is not cool. There's only two lessons that you're supposed to take\""]
["07:56,660","08:00,540","\"from that and friendship fixes everything and water conducts electricity.\""]
["08:00,540","08:02,900","\"It's about all you learn from Pokemon.\""]
["08:02,900","08:04,980","\"But only water containing electrolytes.\""]
["08:04,980","08:05,980","\"Really?\""]
["08:05,980","08:08,500","\"Pure water does not conduct electricity at all.\""]
["08:08,500","08:09,500","\"That's horseshit.\""]
["08:09,500","08:10,500","\"Have you seen the episode of Pokemon?\""]
["08:10,500","08:11,500","\"It's absolutely true.\""]
["08:11,500","08:12,700","\"Have you seen the episode?\""]
["08:12,700","08:15,060","\"You're never going to find a pure source of water in nature.\""]
["08:15,060","08:18,300","\"Have you seen the episode where he takes off all of his clothes when he goes to have a\""]
["08:18,300","08:21,860","\"shower and everything under his clothes is horribly burnt, but you never really see\""]
["08:21,860","08:22,860","\"it?\""]
["08:22,860","08:23,860","\"It was ash?\""]
["08:23,860","08:24,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:24,860","08:25,860","\"Because he always gets shocked by Pikachu but he never gets disfigured.\""]
["08:25,860","08:28,140","\"- That was like a thing where you see like,\""]
["08:28,140","08:31,300","\"he pulls up his sleeve and his wrists all black.\""]
["08:31,300","08:32,140","\"- You're just crazy.\""]
["08:32,140","08:32,980","\"- That sounds familiar here.\""]
["08:32,980","08:35,140","\"- Like Ash's dickhole is cauterized shut.\""]
["08:35,140","08:37,140","\"- Pretty much everything under his clothing.\""]
["08:37,140","08:38,340","\"- He's completely sterile.\""]
["08:38,340","08:41,460","\"- It's like a fourth degree burns all over his body.\""]
["08:41,460","08:43,740","\"- That's why Ash keeps doubling down\""]
["08:43,740","08:45,780","\"on his commitment to Pokemon mastery\""]
["08:45,780","08:47,300","\"because he can't have children.\""]
["08:47,300","08:49,020","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:49,020","08:51,300","\"- When he takes off his little cap with the sea on it,\""]
["08:51,300","08:54,020","\"it's like fourth degree ball burns all over his head.\""]
["08:54,020","08:54,860","\"- Oh yeah.\""]
["08:54,860","08:56,860","\"That unit guy from Game of Thrones.\""]
["08:56,860","09:01,860","\"- I wanna see some bald, score scalp ash fan art now.\""]
["09:01,860","09:03,820","\"- Dude, look at their little shaky hats.\""]
["09:03,820","09:06,980","\"- Oh dude, it's like Shadow the Jester.\""]
["09:06,980","09:09,300","\"Pretty much, same colors.\""]
["09:09,300","09:10,620","\"- Shadow the Jester.\""]
["09:10,620","09:12,060","\"- This is a really cool story.\""]
["09:12,060","09:15,060","\"Yeah, I'm kind of on the edge of my seat right now.\""]
["09:15,060","09:15,900","\"- Wow.\""]
["09:15,900","09:18,100","\"- Rhino Dino.\""]
["09:18,100","09:20,300","\"Uh oh.\""]
["09:20,300","09:21,860","\"Look at this Rhino Dino go.\""]
["09:22,940","09:29,980","\"The mechanics of this game are kinda cool, no pun intended, but like, I honestly, I don't\""]
["09:29,980","09:36,420","\"know why they would feel compelled to be like, \"\"You're a robot jester that shoots lightning.\"\"\""]
["09:36,420","09:37,420","\"Oh.\""]
["09:37,420","09:41,020","\"Yeah, I don't know where that came from.\""]
["09:41,020","09:45,780","\"Yeah, and I don't know why you'd feel strongly enough about it to stick with it all the way\""]
["09:45,780","09:48,860","\"through production to the point where you just end up as that.\""]
["09:48,860","09:54,380","\"about a jester in particular which has no like bearing on any modern anything\""]
["09:54,380","09:59,900","\"and then yeah it's particularly off-kilter I don't know maybe because they needed\""]
["09:59,900","10:03,620","\"something like Sonic spikes to show the movement or something so they were like\""]
["10:03,620","10:08,660","\"yeah give him a jester hat but even that like I don't know what am I doing wrong\""]
["10:08,660","10:13,580","\"like I haven't seen him tell a single joke so there's not as far as I know\""]
["10:13,580","10:18,560","\"there's there's no compelling reason for him to be a jester yeah there's no\""]
["10:18,560","10:21,300","\"And he doesn't have that classic sonic attitude\""]
["10:21,300","10:31,220","\"Maybe there's interviews with the people that made this game where they talk about how they come from a long lineage of gestures\""]
["10:31,220","10:33,220","\"And they're the first to become a game programmer\""]
["10:33,220","10:37,660","\"They wanted to bring an essential aspect of their culture to video games. I don't know\""]
["10:37,660","10:44,860","\"Yeah, man, you just this fight is just about whittling down his little health bar over forever\""]
["10:45,700","10:47,300","\"- The Goo Goo Gaga toad.\""]
["10:47,300","10:49,300","\"- Get you wiggly down!\""]
["10:49,300","10:50,140","\"You wiggly!\""]
["10:50,140","10:53,060","\"- Oh, why is that Goo Goo Gaga toad?\""]
["10:53,060","10:55,180","\"- I don't know, you were like baby talkin' at us.\""]
["10:55,180","10:57,180","\"- Wiggly down, wiggle is a word.\""]
["10:57,180","10:58,980","\"- Whittle, instant bar is the shit.\""]
["10:58,980","11:00,180","\"- It's a little, it's,\""]
["11:00,180","11:02,340","\"- Make it little, you make it little.\""]
["11:02,340","11:05,060","\"- When you slowly carve away at a large piece\""]
["11:05,060","11:08,180","\"of something like wood, it's called whittling.\""]

["11:16,580","11:23,500","\"You saying that's what you are no, but I'm saying like 40 did some of the sonic adventure music right?\""]
["11:23,500","11:27,340","\"Yeah, no, they were clearly channeling that whoever made this song\""]
["11:27,340","11:34,260","\"This is a weird way to end the battle seem like it was stuttering there. It's is it stuck exploding. I don't know what's going on\""]

["12:41,600","12:45,940","\"- I was just gonna, like, that thing where people\""]
["12:45,940","12:48,060","\"were getting depressed 'cause, like, the world wasn't,\""]
["12:48,060","12:50,540","\"like, Pandora from \"\"The Avatar.\"\" - Oh, from \"\"Avatar.\"\"\""]

["13:08,980","13:14,380","\"We're for big grown-ups. You would have just gotten impaled and died instantly on the spikes\""]
["13:14,380","13:16,720","\"I don't know I feel like I am a big grown-up\""]
["13:16,720","13:20,740","\"And then you have to feel the last time I turn to the camera and said fuck\""]
["13:20,740","13:23,220","\"Yeah, crud\""]
["13:23,220","13:26,900","\"See us sonic fans can handle a little swearing. Yeah\""]

["13:40,700","13:45,180","\"Oh come on. I blocked that run past these guys sure seems like it\""]
["13:45,180","13:47,980","\"Oops\""]
["13:47,980","13:55,100","\"So is the objective is you have to like get to a robot king and entertain him or something like that\""]
["13:55,100","14:02,300","\"I don't think being a gesture. Oh, it's real to the story. Oh fuck. You just glitched out motherfucker\""]
["14:02,300","14:04,700","\"Uh oh. How much do you value life?\""]
["14:04,700","14:07,100","\"It just fucking killed me the second I tried getting back in.\""]
["14:07,100","14:07,900","\"Enough to preserve.\""]
["14:07,900","14:11,980","\"It was probably a killbox because that was outside of the walkable part of the level.\""]
["14:11,980","14:13,100","\"Was this the beginning of the level?\""]
["14:13,100","14:14,300","\"You're going backward, do I think?\""]
["14:14,300","14:16,380","\"Okay, I was making sure I wasn't at the very start again.\""]
["14:16,380","14:20,220","\"This looks new.\""]
["14:20,220","14:25,340","\"Or maybe I just have like a shit memory, but look, if you boost over and over,\""]
["14:25,340","14:26,860","\"you actually go slower, Lyle. See?\""]
["14:26,860","14:28,380","\"Don't do that then.\""]
["14:30,540","14:32,540","\"Whoa, that looked pretty cool. Oh\""]
["14:32,540","14:35,940","\"Stuck that landing good. I like these segments\""]
["14:35,940","14:40,360","\"Yeah, anything where you get to just keep like momentum is pretty\""]
["14:40,360","14:44,780","\"Is literally nothing\""]
["14:44,780","14:49,520","\"There you go right on go on general\""]
["14:49,520","14:54,740","\"Could you have done like a little sonic flip there sure when you watch?\""]
["14:54,740","14:56,900","\"Could you have?\""]
["14:57,260","15:00,860","\"So we press A when he watches off thing he goes yeah go and then\""]
["15:00,860","15:09,460","\"He says what I don't know. He says like he says wacko. Yeah something like that. Oh god. Oh fuck. This is scary\""]
["15:09,460","15:12,260","\"There we go homing attack you got it. You did it\""]
["15:12,260","15:16,940","\"That was entertaining\""]
["15:16,940","15:18,580","\"There we go\""]
["15:18,580","15:22,620","\"That felt pretty good sure did all the way to the end fuck him up fuck you asshole\""]
["15:22,620","15:28,740","\"He's gonna punch up that wall is sentient kill it you kind of don't have to take his shit anymore. He's not your real dad\""]
["15:28,740","15:31,900","\"none on that oh\""]
["15:31,900","15:34,180","\"Man\""]
["15:34,180","15:38,580","\"He got his nails did though. That makes him more powerful than ever before he's got yeah\""]
["15:38,580","15:40,580","\"He's big got big coke thumbnails\""]
["15:40,580","15:44,500","\"You got his nails did well. You only need like one more hit to kill him\""]
["15:44,500","15:47,940","\"Oh, yeah, he does have a health bar right there\""]
["15:49,660","15:54,100","\"These parts are fucking weird. I'm not sure if the game's bugging out or not. Uh, yeah\""]
["15:54,100","16:00,100","\"It seems like it is but look where I found that could also be a choice. Who knows I found the door the gold ring\""]
["16:00,100","16:06,700","\"That's a very similar sound effect to the ring at the end of Sonic. I'm just saying I feel like they might have ripped off some stuff\""]
["16:06,700","16:12,180","\"Just say you might have taken some light inspiration, but this is kind of a kind of its own thing\""]
["16:12,180","16:16,940","\"I mean was Sonic a jester that shot lightning. Wait, is this the same fucking level?\""]
["16:18,260","16:21,120","\"Yes, what the hell is it? Yeah\""]
["16:21,120","16:24,620","\"What's going on just happen what's going on father?\""]
["16:24,620","16:30,700","\"There's a checkpoint did you pick a level and just select the same one threw me back into the same\""]
["16:30,700","16:32,700","\"They didn't even get to the screen this time\""]
["16:32,700","16:38,140","\"Floor floor you plan. Yeah, go to the go to the floor to plant. Why did they not bring me to that?\""]
["16:38,140","16:43,380","\"What if well, let's see if it actually is something new. Yes, no. Okay. It is. Yeah, it was weird\""]
["16:43,980","16:51,660","\"Must have hit something wrong on a menu maybe or maybe the game's broken everything that no, I must have been you\""]
["16:51,660","17:01,940","\"I couldn't help and shame him into leaping\""]
["17:01,940","17:05,500","\"This is kind of scary stuff\""]
["17:05,500","17:11,780","\"Oh, you didn't get another dash after that. Nope. Oh god. This is stressful. I\""]
["17:12,420","17:18,400","\"Don't know man something about falling in lava. It's kind of stressful to be the classic up lava slide level\""]
["17:18,400","17:23,060","\"Why would you want to go to this world? Why get go fucking run up the snow you idiot?\""]
["17:23,060","17:25,380","\"Right there\""]
["17:25,380","17:27,300","\"It's going to the same place\""]
["17:27,300","17:33,820","\"Is it pouring out of that uh that ominous facility is that foreshadowing this might be some foreshadowing?\""]
["17:33,820","17:37,620","\"I'm not a Sonic game if there's not like an anti technology message\""]
["17:37,620","17:40,180","\"I like it though\""]
["17:40,380","17:46,100","\"Unlike Sonic's anti-technology message because they always make it the fat man's fault. Whatever happened to stick ball\""]
["17:46,100","17:54,140","\"Good old fashioned stick ball. Whatever happened to looking a fellow in the eye and having a good conversation. What happened to firm handshakes?\""]
["17:54,140","18:00,680","\"That's the moral of Sonic. Sonic wants you to do away with all that. What is this? What's a helmet?\""]
["18:00,680","18:03,220","\"I got a fucking upgrade. Oh my god. Holy shit\""]
["18:03,220","18:07,820","\"You've been missing like a whole other aspect of this game. So this is cool\""]
["18:07,820","18:10,700","\"It's got fucking like Mario 3-esque costumes.\""]
["18:10,700","18:13,560","\"It seems like a thing where if you get hit once you lose it,\""]
["18:13,560","18:14,900","\"whoa dear.\""]
["18:14,900","18:16,800","\"And don't run into those fucking lasers.\""]
["18:16,800","18:17,540","\"What are you doing?\""]
["18:17,540","18:18,540","\"What are you doing?\""]
["18:18,540","18:19,980","\"I thought I could dash through them.\""]
["18:19,980","18:21,980","\"We never got to see Professor Flea.\""]
["18:21,980","18:23,580","\"Yeah, it's Omar, sorry.\""]
["18:23,580","18:25,060","\"Guess we're just not gonna do that now.\""]
["18:25,060","18:25,900","\"It's a bummer.\""]
["18:25,900","18:27,820","\"I think we should Google Professor Flea\""]
["18:27,820","18:29,500","\"and put in a cut scene about him.\""]
["18:29,500","18:30,940","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
