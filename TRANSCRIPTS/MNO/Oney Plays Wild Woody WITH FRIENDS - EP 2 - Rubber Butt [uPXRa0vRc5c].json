["01:18,760","01:19,760","\"No, here, here.\""]
["01:19,760","01:21,760","\"Let me show you the best mechanic in this game.\""]
["01:21,760","01:26,280","\"So all those little notepads have picked up you get power-ups, huh?\""]
["01:26,280","01:29,800","\"So\""]
["01:29,800","01:32,040","\"Now I have a king to rule\""]
["01:32,040","01:36,580","\"Except it controls like shit. Oh, this is here here\""]
["01:36,580","01:40,080","\"So look every time you do a drawing. Oh no you get a little bit shorter\""]
["01:40,080","01:45,120","\"And you can does that mean you can't jump far you can draw two things and then you can't draw anymore\""]
["01:45,120","01:48,540","\"But it means I can get a little bit higher up. So if I do another one\""]
["01:50,000","01:52,000","\"Like this\""]
["01:52,000","01:57,160","\"It means I could actually jump from there now whoa, but also\""]
["01:57,160","02:03,040","\"You know how you do that compared to just a little jump you hold up and jump for a reason\""]
["02:03,040","02:07,840","\"They don't explain any of this to you. It's not intuitive in any way that's intuitive. Oh\""]
["02:07,840","02:12,800","\"No, God Jesus fuck is it always bouncing? I\""]
["02:14,480","02:19,480","\"Never mind. I was gonna let you feel like he's a little man. He's really pissed off\""]
["02:19,480","02:26,700","\"I would be too if you got if you got down to a nub and now I can barely make jumps because he's so short\""]
["02:26,700","02:36,320","\"Oh, dude, it's a me you went down to Mario pipe. I\""]
["02:36,320","02:42,240","\"Like his run cycle when he's small. Oh, I like what he does that too. Yeah\""]
["02:43,920","02:49,360","\"Like smaller version butter. He's got a big fat chode. He's got a fucking chode on it. Oh\""]
["02:49,360","02:57,760","\"Well, that was that was good luck. Did you even think that was gonna? No, I didn't know where it was also it dumps you directly on something\""]
["02:57,760","03:02,560","\"That's gonna of course it does that's everything in this game. There's no structure to these levels\""]
["03:02,560","03:07,680","\"It's just a mess and you're supposed to figure out how to walk through it. They're using the same sound fawns of shinobi\""]
["03:09,440","03:13,740","\"We're gonna die. Oh, yeah, he's gonna kill me when you rub people at it sounds like a door opening in shinobi\""]
["03:13,740","03:16,220","\"Okay\""]
["03:16,220","03:20,600","\"See does it a little bit it sounds like the fucking doors opening\""]
["03:20,600","03:27,440","\"Doorbeats in revenge of shinobi. Can we play that we can play shinobi? I love shinobi. I thought you said you hate shinobi\""]
["03:27,440","03:32,920","\"It's terrible, but I love it. It's got stupid music and stupid bosses and stupid control some of the music in it\""]
["03:36,240","03:41,320","\"That one if this is supposed to be Greek themed why did they what the fuck Egyptian music?\""]
["03:41,320","03:47,520","\"Oh, okay, what do I was kidding? I know I like the music in shinobi, but it is dumb. You gotta admit\""]
["03:47,520","03:53,560","\"No, it's really stupid, but that's why it's a fun game. Yeah, it doesn't take itself serious. It's really hard. Yes, it is\""]
["03:53,560","03:58,320","\"That's why I surprise you want to play it. You should beat it. Oh, okay, Woody. I\""]
["03:58,320","04:03,400","\"Don't want to beat it like a hundred percent though fuck that\""]
