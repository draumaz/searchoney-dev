["04:11,580","04:16,180","\"Can you just use a stick by self-dispatience with ice socket or do you have to put it with other stuff?\""]
["04:16,180","04:21,340","\"It's definitely more effective to build like a sword if you want to smash somebody's ice socket\""]

["05:11,600","05:12,600","\"in Minecraft?\""]
["05:12,600","05:15,840","\"- Let's build, I think we need to come up\""]
["05:15,840","05:17,880","\"with some bold, like,\""]
["05:17,880","05:19,600","\"- Toilet system. - And goal here.\""]
["05:19,600","05:22,040","\"- We need a place to put the sewage.\""]
["05:22,040","05:24,000","\"It's gonna keep piling up if we don't get it somewhere.\""]
["05:24,000","05:26,320","\"- Yeah, let's make that our first endeavor.\""]
["05:26,320","05:29,320","\"- All right, so we're gonna create a working sewer system.\""]
["05:29,320","05:31,640","\"- Yeah, yes, please.\""]
["05:31,640","05:32,560","\"Wait, what's this dirt?\""]

["05:34,480","05:35,480","\"- I think that's what you've just been doing.\""]
["05:35,480","05:36,480","\"I think it's just cool.\""]
["05:36,480","05:41,160","\"- No stupid, look, no yellow dots is yellow dots.\""]
["05:41,160","05:42,520","\"- Oh, no, I think the yellow dots\""]

["06:04,700","06:06,600","\"- Well, now you can make stone tools.\""]
["06:06,600","06:07,780","\"- You're right, I see what you're saying,\""]
["06:07,780","06:08,700","\"but you're not special,\""]
["06:08,700","06:09,900","\"'cause look at this difference.\""]
["06:09,900","06:11,420","\"- The yellow is definitely just,\""]

["06:12,980","06:15,340","\"and it's how you,\""]
["06:15,340","06:18,820","\"I think you later on can use it for stuff like,\""]
["06:18,820","06:19,660","\"Like magic.\""]
["06:19,660","06:22,860","\"- Oh my craft, my craft.\""]

["06:54,740","06:55,580","\"You'll see.\""]
["06:55,580","06:57,340","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:57,340","06:59,380","\"This is the start of the sewer.\""]

["07:01,780","07:03,660","\"Yeah, keep talking to him.\""]
["07:03,660","07:05,020","\"- I have city dagger.\""]
["07:05,020","07:08,660","\"- How hard would it be to make a little sewer\""]
["07:08,660","07:09,700","\"and fill it with water?\""]
["07:09,700","07:11,340","\"First you get a-- - You gotta build\""]
["07:11,340","07:12,820","\"the toilet bowl.\""]
["07:12,820","07:15,420","\"You can make that out of stone for me, right?\""]
["07:15,420","07:16,300","\"- Well, I would say, sorry, time of real,\""]
["07:16,300","07:17,540","\"for real life for a second, I was gonna,\""]
["07:17,540","07:18,540","\"For you know, even had that idea.\""]

["07:21,580","07:24,740","\"how hard do you think it'd be in real life to build a sewage system in your backyard?\""]
["07:24,740","07:26,420","\"I think pretty difficult.\""]
["07:26,420","07:29,060","\"The Romans did it in like 1905 or whatever.\""]
["07:29,060","07:30,340","\"In 1905?\""]
["07:30,340","07:32,140","\"Like BC?\""]

["07:48,580","07:50,260","\"You were previous to that?\""]
["07:50,260","07:51,900","\"- Hmm, can't find the sheep.\""]
["07:51,900","07:53,700","\"Maybe I cannot go on.\""]
["07:53,700","07:54,860","\"Maybe I'm the sheep.\""]
["07:54,860","07:56,140","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:56,140","07:58,060","\"Oh, oh, oh.\""]
