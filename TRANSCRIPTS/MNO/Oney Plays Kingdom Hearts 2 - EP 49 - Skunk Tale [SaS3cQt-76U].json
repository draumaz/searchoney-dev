["02:50,160","02:55,360","\"Caring it's just like oh, oh yeah, so\""]
["02:55,360","03:01,160","\"His hair would have to be combed in two separate directions\""]

["03:31,740","03:33,260","\"I don't think there'd be a hair.\""]
["03:33,260","03:37,960","\"It would just be two like giant lumps of hair, like they'd be physical objects.\""]
["03:37,960","03:42,460","\"He's just got two giant like Afros on his forehead and that to carve an air.\""]

["18:50,100","18:54,300","\"Is it supposed to be relatable, or is it supposed to be him being self-deprecating?\""]

["22:40,280","22:43,440","\"I should mention that he's like embarrassed to himself\""]
["22:43,440","22:44,520","\"about masturbating.\""]
["22:44,520","22:45,360","\"- Yeah.\""]
["22:45,360","22:46,200","\"- Like he's got the silver one.\""]
["22:46,200","22:49,240","\"- Let's get this over with as if like he doesn't wanna do it.\""]
["22:49,240","22:50,080","\"- Yeah.\""]
["22:50,080","22:51,520","\"- Like he's being forced into it.\""]
["22:51,520","22:54,120","\"- But then the whole point of the cartoon is now\""]
["22:54,120","22:59,120","\"is when he starts hallucinating a pink or a purple skunk girl\""]
["22:59,120","23:01,520","\"who's now his imaginary girlfriend,\""]
["23:01,520","23:06,740","\"And they start talking about how even though he's crazy, it's okay because he's having fun with it.\""]
["23:06,740","23:12,680","\"And then they start like walking around together and he's blushing and he's embarrassed, but he loves her so much.\""]
["23:12,680","23:15,040","\"And then it kind of cuts off and nothing happens.\""]
["23:15,040","23:21,080","\"Uh, yeah, that's pretty much the rest of it is just him justifying to himself why it's okay to be crazy.\""]
["23:21,080","23:27,780","\"But we just summarized the whole thing, but you should go watch it just to see the little details that you will not understand for the life of you.\""]
["23:27,780","23:30,340","\"I think it's really interesting.\""]
["23:30,340","23:33,140","\"- Especially the more you watch it, the more you watch it.\""]
["23:33,140","23:34,820","\"- The ending is really compelling\""]
["23:34,820","23:38,500","\"because you're having somebody who clearly is not there at all.\""]
["23:38,500","23:40,180","\"- He's creating an echo chamber for himself\""]
["23:40,180","23:42,220","\"so he doesn't have to feel bad about being bad.\""]
["23:42,220","23:43,660","\"- Yeah, it's interesting.\""]
["23:43,660","23:46,820","\"It's like kind of watching Garth Merengi, for example,\""]
["23:46,820","23:49,580","\"that it's a story being told by someone,\""]
["23:49,580","23:52,740","\"kind of portraying himself as the hero\""]
["23:52,740","23:54,980","\"because the world around him frustrates him\""]
["23:54,980","23:56,220","\"and he doesn't have a place there\""]
["23:56,220","23:58,420","\"because of his own like fault.\""]
["23:58,420","23:59,260","\"- Yeah.\""]
["23:59,260","24:04,560","\"you watch it the more little details you pick up on yeah it's uh it is too bad\""]
["24:04,560","24:08,500","\"people made fun of them because I wish he just kind of got to go on I want it\""]
["24:08,500","24:13,620","\"he opens it up with a little intro that says like naked animals production or\""]
["24:13,620","24:18,100","\"something like that when people do stuff like this I don't see him do more I don't\""]
["24:18,100","24:21,220","\"want people to stop when they do this stuff people always go in and like\""]
["24:21,220","24:25,900","\"attack them and try to make them like want to give up let them do it like if\""]
["24:25,900","24:29,060","\"If you're being entertained by it, what's the problem?\""]
["24:29,060","24:31,460","\"Everyone can enjoy it then.\""]
["24:31,460","24:32,820","\"To be fair.\""]

["24:50,100","24:51,100","\"That's pretty shitty.\""]
["24:51,100","24:53,260","\"I can't really justify that.\""]
