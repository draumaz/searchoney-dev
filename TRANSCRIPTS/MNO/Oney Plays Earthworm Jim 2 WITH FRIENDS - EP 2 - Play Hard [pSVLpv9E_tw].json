["03:05,920","03:06,760","\"- But did it say,\""]
["03:06,760","03:08,360","\"- There's the joke is that there's no explanation.\""]
["03:08,360","03:09,200","\"- It's crazy.\""]
["03:09,200","03:10,040","\"- That's why the humor comes from.\""]
["03:10,040","03:11,680","\"- Every copy of Earthworm Jim Tomb came\""]
["03:11,680","03:13,600","\"with a little amine to give you hints.\""]

["03:15,240","03:16,600","\"- Earthworm Jim is very wacky.\""]
["03:16,600","03:18,960","\"- But he would also lie to you that's a creepy poster.\""]
["03:18,960","03:19,800","\"- Exactly.\""]
["03:19,800","03:20,640","\"- It's not a lie.\""]
["03:20,640","03:22,360","\"- That's part of the difficulty.\""]
["03:22,360","03:25,080","\"He failing on this level realistic intestines come out of the game.\""]
["03:25,080","03:27,580","\"So can I earthworm Jim just turn into anything?\""]
["03:27,580","03:28,580","\"Test?\""]

["03:52,460","03:57,300","\"I- I think not in the game because I forgot about it.\""]
["03:57,300","03:57,800","\"Really?\""]
["03:57,800","03:59,760","\"It's supposed to be a power.\""]
["03:59,760","04:01,840","\"A secret move for Jim.\""]
["04:01,840","04:04,600","\"Hey, that was actually the right answer too.\""]
["04:04,600","04:05,100","\"Who's me?\""]
["04:05,100","04:07,800","\"But usually it's not the right answer.\""]
["04:07,800","04:10,740","\"Just grinding up these words to press me.\""]
["04:10,740","04:11,800","\"Was he make it good?\""]
["04:11,800","04:13,700","\"Makes a good BLT sandwich.\""]

["04:15,200","04:16,900","\"No, it wasn't BLT.\""]
["04:16,900","04:17,400","\"What was it?\""]
["04:17,400","04:18,140","\"I don't know.\""]
["04:18,140","04:18,840","\"A hood ornament.\""]
["04:18,840","04:20,840","\"Just like everything else.\""]
["04:20,840","04:24,080","\"- Well, exactly is a mojo.\""]
["04:24,080","04:25,480","\"- A whole joke of mojo.\""]
["04:25,480","04:26,320","\"- A mojo?\""]
["04:26,320","04:28,720","\"- Hey, it was right.\""]
["04:28,720","04:29,880","\"- Oh shit.\""]
["04:29,880","04:32,320","\"- Mojo, baby, he says, \"\"May.\"\"\""]
["04:32,320","04:33,760","\"- Hey, Eagle, sweet.\""]
["04:33,760","04:35,560","\"- Julian, given the chance\""]
["04:35,560","04:39,000","\"would you throw these into traffic and cause an accident?\""]
["04:39,000","04:40,240","\"- How big are they?\""]
["04:40,240","04:41,400","\"- The size of your head.\""]
["04:41,400","04:43,840","\"- What if they were--\""]
["04:43,840","04:47,000","\"- I feel that would probably would cause an accident.\""]
["04:47,000","04:47,840","\"- Okay, no.\""]
["04:47,840","04:50,560","\"- You have all four of them, same variety, different colors.\""]
["04:50,560","04:51,560","\"Um...\""]
["04:51,560","04:56,060","\"I'd probably rather leave them where people would bump into them.\""]
["04:56,060","04:58,460","\"Like in a...\""]
["04:58,460","05:02,060","\"I don't know, I was gonna say in a bathroom, but I feel like there's not really\""]
["05:02,060","05:04,760","\"many situations where you can accidentally run into them.\""]
["05:04,760","05:06,560","\"What if they were the size of coffee table?\""]
["05:06,560","05:09,360","\"Can I make them hover in thin air like this?\""]
["05:09,360","05:10,660","\"You can throw them like pretty things.\""]
["05:10,660","05:12,660","\"Okay, I would put them behind doors.\""]
["05:12,660","05:14,860","\"Just smack them back in their face.\""]
["05:14,860","05:15,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:15,360","05:19,360","\"I don't think I got to see that one.\""]
["05:20,060","05:20,560","\"Uh oh.\""]
["05:20,560","05:22,060","\"He got signed in my door.\""]
["05:22,060","05:24,060","\"Oh, maybe not.\""]
["05:24,060","05:25,060","\"Purple?\""]
["05:25,060","05:26,060","\"No.\""]
["05:26,060","05:27,060","\"Purple?\""]
["05:27,060","05:28,060","\"Quick misleading me.\""]
["05:28,060","05:29,060","\"He's yellow.\""]
["05:29,060","05:30,060","\"Purple.\""]
["05:30,060","05:32,060","\"Who's room do you think this is?\""]
["05:32,060","05:33,060","\"Mine.\""]
["05:33,060","05:35,060","\"This is Uncle Bunkz, this is Chainz.\""]
["05:35,060","05:41,060","\"It's very hard to talk, listen to talking, and try to memorize the time it says, \"\"Well, well done.\"\"\""]
["05:41,060","05:42,060","\"There being me.\""]
["05:42,060","05:45,060","\"I hate that cow smile, I just noticed it.\""]
["05:45,060","05:46,060","\"It's really fucking weird.\""]
["05:46,060","05:49,060","\"He doesn't smile on the Genesis one.\""]
["05:49,060","05:50,820","\"- Oh, this is like it does.\""]
["05:50,820","05:51,660","\"- He knows.\""]
["05:51,660","05:53,140","\"- I don't remember him animating a smile.\""]
["05:53,140","05:54,700","\"I just remember him having a blank face.\""]
["05:54,700","05:55,540","\"- It's just smiling.\""]
["05:55,540","05:56,740","\"- It's really hard to notice 'cause it's funny.\""]
["05:56,740","05:57,860","\"- Well, no, I think he's smiling,\""]
["05:57,860","05:59,860","\"but I don't think I did not mean to do that, actually.\""]
["05:59,860","06:00,780","\"- Kind of for the best level.\""]
["06:00,780","06:02,740","\"- Yeah, this level fucking sucks.\""]
["06:02,740","06:03,580","\"- Yeah?\""]
["06:03,580","06:04,420","\"- Why this game's so good?\""]
["06:04,420","06:06,500","\"- This is the worst level in this game\""]
["06:06,500","06:08,060","\"and probably in the whole series.\""]
["06:08,060","06:10,100","\"- Dave, no, would you say this is a good game\""]
["06:10,100","06:11,940","\"for as much as we love the art style?\""]
["06:11,940","06:12,980","\"Like, is it?\""]
["06:12,980","06:14,100","\"Would you say it's good?\""]
["06:14,100","06:15,420","\"- It's very flawed.\""]
["06:15,420","06:16,260","\"- You're kidding.\""]
["06:16,260","06:17,820","\"- I enjoy plenty about it,\""]
["06:17,820","06:19,460","\"but it's very very flawed.\""]
["06:19,460","06:21,740","\"- It's, I think the first game does better job.\""]
["06:21,740","06:22,540","\"- Yes. - Why are they\""]
["06:22,540","06:23,900","\"doing Patrick at you?\""]
["06:23,900","06:25,740","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:25,740","06:27,540","\"- It's what it looks like, yeah.\""]
["06:27,540","06:29,380","\"- There we go. - Oh my god.\""]
["06:29,380","06:31,020","\"- That's the way to do this one by the way.\""]
["06:31,020","06:31,840","\"- What would it be?\""]
["06:31,840","06:33,540","\"- You wanna hit it into the rocket.\""]
["06:33,540","06:36,980","\"Also these are really annoying.\""]
["06:36,980","06:39,780","\"- Sounds just like Julian screaming his bar.\""]
["06:39,780","06:41,540","\"- It's like exactly the same.\""]
["06:41,540","06:42,380","\"- Go!\""]
["06:42,380","06:43,620","\"- I like the art for this part.\""]
["06:43,620","06:44,460","\"- Looks cool.\""]
["06:44,460","06:45,820","\"I mean, that's why they did this part.\""]
["06:45,820","06:46,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:46,660","06:48,260","\"- Just to show off the 3D.\""]
["06:48,260","06:49,100","\"- Hey!\""]
["06:49,100","06:50,180","\"(coughing)\""]
["06:50,180","06:51,020","\"- It's a tasty.\""]
["06:51,020","06:52,740","\"- The skin's ripping off Crash Bandicoot.\""]
["06:52,740","06:54,220","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:54,220","06:56,140","\"- When Crash Bandicoot says tasty.\""]
["06:56,140","06:57,060","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:57,060","06:58,780","\"He should say tasty, that'd be your quote.\""]
["06:58,780","06:59,620","\"- Tasty!\""]
["06:59,620","07:01,420","\"- He says that at the end of the Crash of the Tasty.\""]
["07:01,420","07:03,060","\"It's pancakes!\""]
["07:03,060","07:04,220","\"- Oh God.\""]
