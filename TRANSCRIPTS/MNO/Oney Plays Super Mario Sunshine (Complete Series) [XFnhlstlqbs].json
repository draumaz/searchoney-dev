["00:26,400","00:28,800","\"This is, uh...\""]
["00:28,800","00:35,560","\"Whenever I think whenever people talk about like how Mario and its cast is completely like fucking brain dead\""]
["00:35,560","00:38,600","\"And like they have no human thoughts\""]
["00:38,600","00:42,780","\"This is always the game that I think of because you get shots like this\""]
["00:42,780","00:48,000","\"Yeah, where she's just staring for like 30 minutes before she can even say a single word\""]

["02:11,640","02:14,640","\"Oh, yeah, what I hear that at the voice\""]
["02:14,640","02:25,120","\"Do you like how long this this opening takes Chris it's pretty good you have to watch him sit in the jail cell for 45 minutes\""]
["02:25,120","02:27,920","\"(laughs)\""]
["02:27,920","02:29,460","\"You have to wait out your sentence.\""]

["02:31,860","02:35,360","\"- Wouldn't you squirt Chris?\""]
["02:35,360","02:37,000","\"- I guess.\""]
["02:37,000","02:39,120","\"- I really wish that the flood got utilized\""]
["02:39,120","02:43,680","\"more in this game than it was less about like the...\""]
["02:43,680","02:48,600","\"I know we disagree, me and DingDong disagree on Mario Sunshine.\""]
["02:48,600","02:51,760","\"He really likes the secret stages\""]
["02:51,760","02:53,760","\"where you jump around on the blocks.\""]
["02:53,760","02:54,600","\"- No, I like those two.\""]
["02:54,600","02:59,040","\"Like when he I like when he floats around on the on the flood and it's fun\""]
["02:59,040","03:02,840","\"I was there was more squirting at things. I think more well\""]
["03:02,840","03:07,280","\"I think my cleaning is the less the least fun part. I\""]
["03:07,280","03:13,200","\"Enjoy the movement options that's fair. I think all the movement options are really fun with the flood\""]
["03:13,200","03:15,400","\"I just like having excuses to play with goop\""]
["03:15,400","03:17,560","\"That's fair\""]
["03:17,560","03:19,760","\"That's true. He plays in the mud all the time\""]
["03:20,200","03:26,520","\"Do you guys want to have a heated a debate on who's right and it's not right? Who was wrong?\""]
["03:26,520","03:28,520","\"Haha, I think\""]
["03:28,520","03:30,960","\"this game fucking gay\""]

["03:37,920","03:40,560","\"I'm not in the game\""]
["03:40,560","03:48,640","\"This is a shitty debate this debate on about something that really matters, okay, which do you like better pink or orange?\""]
["03:48,640","03:53,760","\"I liked them both together. I do too. That wasn't a debate was it?\""]
["03:53,760","03:59,200","\"I like I really like the color combinations they choose for the goop.\""]
["03:59,200","04:04,320","\"Pink and orange makes it seem like sherbert. Like it would be really sweet.\""]
["04:04,320","04:09,600","\"When I grew up there was a there was a sweet candy called fruit salad and that's what it reminds me of.\""]
["04:09,600","04:13,360","\"Do you think if you ate the goop it would be toxic and you'd die?\""]
["04:14,240","04:16,240","\"Probably it's just paint Julian\""]
["04:16,240","04:24,080","\"It's paint like goop. Okay. Okay. What about goop like paint. What about painting goopy?\""]
["04:24,080","04:27,600","\"Painting goop-a\""]
["04:27,600","04:35,280","\"Look at my hair. It's flood. Do you think it was you're going to jail? Where did he find it again?\""]
["04:35,280","04:37,280","\"He just found it on the ground and then he took it\""]
["04:37,280","04:40,880","\"Nobody no big question. I gave him a 20 minute tutorial\""]
["04:41,760","04:45,020","\"Now he's in prison. Let's linger on this shot for our goddamn eternity\""]
["04:45,020","04:54,040","\"Cuz it's the first time Mario's ever been in jail. That's not true. The Mario Party commercial he got arrested\""]
["04:54,040","05:00,400","\"What was he doing having a party? That's fair. That one looks really tasty. It does it looks like chocolate\""]
["05:00,400","05:03,160","\"I love the goop. I love it\""]
["05:03,160","05:07,760","\"I think it's such a cool concept and it disappoints me that it like falls off towards the end of the game\""]
["05:10,960","05:15,500","\"I just have weird hang I have weird things that I fixate on and\""]
["05:15,500","05:18,880","\"Paint is probably one of the things I fixate on the most\""]
["05:18,880","05:23,180","\"Smelling it eating it. I wish you could eat paint\""]
["05:23,180","05:28,160","\"I think we just messed that's your famous quote now\""]
["05:28,160","05:33,560","\"I think we discussed already how I really wanted to eat the tubby custard because it was just pink goop\""]
["05:33,560","05:38,160","\"What do you think about seeing in hook where they're all throwing pain at each other and eating it sounds good to me?\""]

["05:55,260","06:02,800","\"We say hook in this country and where we speak English Huckleberry Finn. I wrote a good hook\""]
["06:04,800","06:10,360","\"Why are you sitting like that? Yeah, we're gonna just watch him sit here for fucking ever. You can skip it can't you? No\""]

["10:13,440","10:19,820","\"That's all I remember. I dreamt last night that there we go. That's what it is. I dreamt last night that family guy\""]
["10:19,820","10:23,280","\"Suck McFarland wanted the show to just end already\""]
["10:23,280","10:28,520","\"Yeah, and the second to last episode of the season. It was just Peter Griffin\""]
["10:28,520","10:33,300","\"He's he doesn't look like Peter Griffin anymore. He spiked his hair up and he's wearing a trench coat\""]
["10:33,300","10:38,380","\"And he just went into a mall and he started shooting everybody for 20 minutes of the whole episode\""]
["10:38,380","10:43,040","\"And on the episode after that it was like a creepy pasta and it was just a close foot\""]
["10:43,040","10:45,740","\"on his face with his eyes bleeding and he was screaming.\""]
["10:45,740","10:49,700","\"And it was just that for 20 straight minutes.\""]
["10:49,700","10:54,860","\"I remember having a conversation with somebody and they said like, \"\"Family guy could be funny\""]
["10:54,860","10:55,860","\"sometimes.\"\"\""]
["10:55,860","10:59,260","\"I said, \"\"Did you see the last episode of it?\"\"\""]
["10:59,260","11:02,220","\"And we watched it together and they're just like, \"\"Is this it?\"\"\""]
["11:02,220","11:03,940","\"No one was scared by it.\""]
["11:03,940","11:05,820","\"Everyone was just really bored with it.\""]
["11:05,820","11:08,380","\"Well yeah, why would you be scared by it?\""]
["11:08,380","11:09,780","\"Because he was screaming.\""]
["11:09,780","11:11,300","\"Yeah, it's very spooky.\""]
["11:11,300","11:15,020","\"Because it's very abrupt when it first starts and then it goes for 20 minutes.\""]
["11:15,020","11:19,020","\"♪ Night, yeah, you want to ♪\""]
["11:19,020","11:23,620","\"Do you think probably we'll ever actually do that where they make a full 20-minute episode of One Joke?\""]
["11:23,620","11:24,820","\"They've done it.\""]
["11:24,820","11:26,460","\"And they'd be like, \"\"This is the joke.\"\"\""]
["11:26,460","11:29,020","\"They're gonna do \"\"Chicken Fight the episode.\"\"\""]
["11:29,020","11:31,420","\"They probably have. I'm sure they have already.\""]
["11:31,420","11:32,900","\"That would be bad.\""]
["11:32,900","11:37,480","\"Remember in the the one season when they did the second chicken fight and it went for like 10 minutes\""]
["11:37,480","11:43,200","\"Listen, I thought chicken fight was best. I thought chicken five nine to two was pretty good\""]
["11:43,200","11:46,300","\"Oh chicken fight 37\""]
["11:46,300","11:49,260","\"That's when Peter\""]
["11:49,260","11:54,460","\"Smacks him over the head with one of those noodles you use in swimming pool. Yeah, that was pretty funny\""]
["11:54,460","11:57,460","\"The chicken goes clock clock\""]
["11:57,460","12:00,220","\"Wonder how proud they are of that. I\""]
["12:01,340","12:04,460","\"I don't think anyone on that team is proud of anything they're doing.\""]
["12:04,460","12:07,260","\"Because the first chicken fight was funny as hell.\""]
