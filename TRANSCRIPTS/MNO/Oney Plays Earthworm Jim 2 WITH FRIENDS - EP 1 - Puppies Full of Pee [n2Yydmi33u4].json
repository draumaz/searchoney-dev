["00:47,960","00:49,420","\"I could tell.\""]
["00:49,420","00:51,960","\"I almost never play it because it's\""]

["00:52,960","00:55,260","\"I don't want to say it's hard.\""]
["00:55,260","00:56,960","\"I just not very good at it.\""]
["00:56,960","00:57,560","\"It's OK.\""]
["00:57,560","00:58,960","\"It takes some getting used to.\""]
["00:58,960","01:02,960","\"Or some Jim really likes despicable me, that's why he keeps going, \"\"Grow!\"\"\""]
["01:02,960","01:04,960","\"Was this on Sega Genesis?\""]
["01:04,960","01:08,960","\"Yeah, this was on Genesis, it was on Super Nintendo's on Ew.\""]
["01:08,960","01:09,960","\"Did it have the same music?\""]
["01:09,960","01:10,960","\"It did not have...\""]
["01:10,960","01:11,960","\"It did not have...\""]
["01:11,960","01:16,960","\"That's one of the things you always hear is like people arguing over which the soundtrack is better.\""]
["01:16,960","01:17,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:17,960","01:18,960","\"No, the...\""]
["01:18,960","01:19,960","\"And the Genesis I would say is better for you.\""]

["01:21,960","01:22,960","\"Wait, really?\""]
["01:22,960","01:24,960","\"But, uh, I like this one too.\""]
["01:24,960","01:27,960","\"Well, this is the actual CD quality audio, so this is...\""]
["01:27,960","01:31,560","\"That's the one positive thing about the Sega Saturn version.\""]
["01:31,560","01:33,160","\"Is that you get good music?\""]
["01:33,160","01:33,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:33,660","01:36,360","\"It's the way it's meant to sound.\""]

["01:37,860","01:40,060","\"\"\"Do you like this one or the first one more?\"\"\""]
["01:40,060","01:42,460","\"It's a toss-up.\""]
["01:42,460","01:45,460","\"Because I think some stages in this are very fun.\""]
["01:45,460","01:49,160","\"But the first game is more emphasis on platforming,\""]
["01:49,160","01:51,560","\"and this has some pretty lousy stages here and there.\""]
["01:51,560","01:52,160","\"Yeah, it does.\""]
["01:52,160","01:54,760","\"I fucking hate the flying king.\""]

["01:55,960","01:58,440","\"No, I've fallen and I can't get up\""]
["01:58,440","02:01,840","\"Only a worm would catch me\""]
["02:01,840","02:06,740","\"There we go. I love it if a grandma was obsessed with worms\""]
["02:06,740","02:10,980","\"That's little she gets old. That's true\""]
["02:10,980","02:16,880","\"What if it is your grandmother Chris you go over to visit her and she'd say can you help me count my worm?\""]
["02:16,880","02:20,840","\"I'd put her worms in a blender and tell her to shut the fuck up\""]
["02:20,840","02:22,600","\"- I don't know what you got.\""]
["02:22,600","02:23,920","\"- Hey Chris, why?\""]
["02:23,920","02:26,140","\"- Come on, you're selling worms!\""]
["02:26,140","02:29,100","\"- Chris, I need you to make sure I still have\""]
["02:29,100","02:30,940","\"exactly six worms.\""]

["02:32,440","02:33,280","\"- What is this?\""]
["02:33,280","02:34,280","\"- She's gonna toss you in the granny chair.\""]
["02:34,280","02:37,960","\"- To be fair, I just go out and get her some more worms.\""]
["02:37,960","02:41,240","\"- Why would you kill the worms and just get her new worms?\""]
["02:41,240","02:44,320","\"- So they live forever according to her perception.\""]
["02:44,320","02:45,480","\"- Why?\""]
["02:45,480","02:47,120","\"- If her worms died, it would devastate her.\""]
["02:47,120","02:48,760","\"So I keep replacing them.\""]
["02:48,760","02:49,600","\"- Oh my worms!\""]
["02:49,600","02:55,180","\"What the fuck is this mechanic in the first level?\""]
["02:55,180","03:07,620","\"Between in between there we go and now go fast. No you\""]
["03:15,040","03:17,860","\"Don't do anything stop stop there we go\""]
["03:17,860","03:23,740","\"You killed him\""]

["03:44,760","03:46,760","\"Oh no.\""]
["03:46,760","03:48,760","\"Dinko, these are the signs.\""]
["03:48,760","03:50,760","\"Oh, that was the grandpa.\""]
["03:50,760","03:51,760","\"That would be a dead grandma.\""]

["04:23,720","04:31,600","\"Speaking of which we had a fun time at octopi. Yeah, it's a good chain. We saw a skeleton get aborted\""]
