["02:19,080","02:21,080","\"Because that's where you came from right?\""]
["02:21,080","02:26,200","\"I'm going down that way. So going right made you go up. Yeah, it's very helpful, isn't it?\""]
["02:26,200","02:32,240","\"Yeah, let's see. It's not like it's like exactly true to the real location and at all anyways\""]
["02:32,240","02:39,840","\"Why not just design it a little better? Why not have like a consistent directional flow is my question. Yeah, I think you're\""]

["05:40,120","05:41,160","\"This isn't a ride.\""]
["05:41,160","05:43,400","\"This is real life.\""]
["05:43,400","05:47,120","\"Maybe that's where universal wants to go with future stuff.\""]
["05:47,120","05:50,720","\"What, just child endangerment?\""]
["05:50,720","05:52,720","\"It's a pretty bold move, honestly.\""]
["05:52,720","05:55,720","\"I guess if nothing else it is that.\""]
["05:55,720","05:57,720","\"I'm not afraid anymore.\""]

["06:04,720","06:05,720","\"Yes, it's at the front.\""]
["06:05,720","06:07,720","\"That's probably where it's going to come in.\""]
["06:07,720","06:09,720","\"Unless he literally does it at random.\""]

["06:18,720","06:20,720","\"That's probably where it's going to come in.\""]
["06:20,720","06:23,720","\"So that's where he's going to keep attacking from now on.\""]
["06:23,720","06:27,460","\"He literally does it at random. No, no, he's gonna come to the front\""]
["06:27,460","06:35,560","\"Let's see so can you just camp that one section and all I would do is coming from here. He's coming oh\""]
["06:35,560","06:38,820","\"Come on\""]
["06:38,820","06:40,820","\"What?\""]

["11:06,160","11:11,600","\"So yeah, the original plot of this ride was that it's like Biff stole the time machine again in your chase\""]
["11:11,600","11:17,100","\"They let you loose. They let you loosen the back to the future ride and your mom tries to fuck you\""]
["11:17,100","11:22,080","\"That's your referring to the plot of the show.\""]
["11:22,080","11:24,880","\"And if she catches you she fucks you until you disappear\""]
["11:24,880","11:31,680","\"Oh look at this. He's going back\""]
["11:31,680","11:38,100","\"back oh cool plays the music that'll\""]
["11:38,100","11:39,840","\"know which means we have to replace the\""]
["11:39,840","11:43,200","\"music you can drift apparently what the\""]
["11:43,200","11:47,600","\"fuck what's going on that's bit that's\""]
["11:47,600","11:49,760","\"just he's just messing with you fuck you\""]
["11:49,760","11:53,680","\"bit oh yeah stupid piece of shit trying\""]
["11:53,680","11:55,960","\"to kill you what it looked like he\""]
["11:55,960","12:00,080","\"crashed into bed fuck yeah yeah who my\""]
["12:00,080","12:06,580","\"You're right. Yeah, who yourself? This is the most un-back to the future thing I've ever seen minus the DeLorean\""]
["12:06,580","12:11,040","\"That's a pretty good DeLorean model actually\""]
["12:11,040","12:18,480","\"For this game. Yeah, this is probably this is actually disproportionately well-made for this game honestly\""]
["12:18,480","12:25,680","\"Come on like this looks like a sonic adventure - level. I'm not gonna get his fucking health down. Oh\""]
["12:25,680","12:29,480","\"Wow, yeah, it takes a lot to fucking cause his death\""]
["12:29,600","12:31,600","\"Where are you going?\""]
["12:31,600","12:34,760","\"Or he's just dead. Yeah, he's dead. I\""]
["12:34,760","12:41,960","\"Bet there will be opportunities to do extra damage. You're chasing him like through all these this is actually kind of neat\""]
["12:41,960","12:45,840","\"This is just like the the ride actually. Yeah, they went to the ice caves\""]
["12:45,840","12:51,640","\"Let's where you do that huge drop. It feels like we're gonna fly down a dinosaur's mouth at some point\""]
["12:51,640","12:58,080","\"I really miss this ride. Yeah, so much better than the Simpsons version of the exact same thing. Yeah, it's really lame. Oh\""]
["12:58,520","12:59,520","\"Oh good.\""]
["12:59,520","13:02,400","\"Like I'm sure part of it is just nostalgia talking but...\""]
["13:02,400","13:03,400","\"No.\""]
["13:03,400","13:04,400","\"Not at all.\""]
["13:04,400","13:08,520","\"Like that ride was built for this video and then with the Simpsons they just like...\""]
["13:08,520","13:10,720","\"I heard that they didn't change anything about it.\""]
["13:10,720","13:16,400","\"They just made it so that the video synced up with what the thing did on the future ride.\""]
["13:16,400","13:17,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["13:17,400","13:21,480","\"Yeah and they even kept the same shitty screen and technology so it's like really dark.\""]
["13:21,480","13:23,560","\"Yeah, that's uh...\""]
["13:23,560","13:27,960","\"I'm not really like an amusement park guy but I will say the fucking Transformers ride\""]
["13:27,960","13:29,880","\"that Universal is actually really cool.\""]
["13:29,880","13:30,800","\"- Yeah, it is pretty sad.\""]
["13:30,800","13:32,160","\"- Oh, it used to be the Spider-Man ride.\""]
["13:32,160","13:34,840","\"- Yeah, well it's the same tech as the Spider-Man.\""]
["13:34,840","13:36,480","\"They still have that Spider-Man ride\""]
["13:36,480","13:37,600","\"at the one in Orlando.\""]
["13:37,600","13:38,480","\"- Oh really?\""]
["13:38,480","13:41,400","\"- Yeah, they're both arguably the best rides\""]
["13:41,400","13:44,680","\"that Universal ever came up with though.\""]
["13:44,680","13:46,440","\"- It sounds like Kingdom Hearts music now.\""]
["13:46,440","13:47,580","\"- It does, yeah.\""]
["13:47,580","13:49,640","\"- Wow!\""]
["13:49,640","13:52,520","\"Fuck you, man.\""]
["13:55,160","13:58,320","\"This is like being killed by a child.\""]

["13:59,160","14:00,540","\"- Yeah.\""]
["14:00,540","14:02,800","\"- Marty's just like, \"\"Who are you, kid?\"\"\""]
["14:02,800","14:04,720","\"Imagine getting in the car accident\""]
["14:04,720","14:06,840","\"that fucking rendered your legs useless\""]
["14:06,840","14:08,520","\"and you could never walk again.\""]
["14:08,520","14:10,920","\"And then a child gets out of the car and is like,\""]
["14:10,920","14:14,280","\"\"\"What a fun ride, I get a stamp now!\"\"\""]
["14:14,280","14:16,560","\"- Dude, I'm gonna fail this, look at this shit.\""]

["14:23,640","14:28,300","\"Okay, so get this pushing or makes you drift left makes a zero fucking sense\""]
["14:28,300","14:32,860","\"This game is not known for its sense of direction\""]
["14:32,860","14:36,160","\"Fuck it. Ah you big bully\""]
["14:36,160","14:42,200","\"What if the main programmer of this game actually had a disability where they can't discern directions\""]
["14:42,200","14:48,480","\"That's why nobody said anything because they didn't want to offend him then we'd be very ableist right now. How dare we I?\""]
["14:49,320","14:55,400","\"Think it's okay to be ableist about who gets to design games for other people to play then if that's the case\""]
["14:55,400","14:57,680","\"God this sucks\""]
["14:57,680","15:00,400","\"Biff needs to just stop being such a dickass\""]
