["00:17,040","00:21,040","\"just a r-a-a random friend or acquaintance there, just seven feet tall?\""]
["00:21,040","00:24,040","\"Why does that insane person want to save the world?\""]
["00:24,040","00:25,040","\"That's cool.\""]
["00:25,040","00:28,040","\"That's basically- Everybody's racing for the right to save the world, right?\""]
["00:28,040","00:32,320","\"Yeah, that's the official thing, Tomar, to deny our tracking missile drop a beaker or TNT.\""]
["00:32,320","00:37,040","\"You think actually if that's the case, that's the only way, but you can't do it if you don't have either of those.\""]
["00:37,040","00:41,960","\"So, so yeah, if you have one of those, you can use it like a like a player or like a chafe.\""]
["00:41,960","00:44,360","\"Damn, look at that cool water effect.\""]

["00:56,520","01:00,240","\"You think there'd be like if that was the case right and they're just trying to beat the alien guy\""]
["01:00,240","01:03,500","\"they wouldn't be the throwing a orbs and\""]
["01:03,500","01:08,160","\"Magic potions and shit at each other. Well you might be a little more like solidarity, right?\""]
["01:08,160","01:13,760","\"Oh, do you think that but I guess still the most ruthless dickhead would be the best one to beat up the alien guy?\""]
["01:13,760","01:18,920","\"Oh, I guess so you're you're saying that they're they're racing for the right to go against this dude, okay\""]
["01:18,920","01:20,920","\"so to represent earth in\""]
["01:20,920","01:25,280","\"This race for the planet so this is all like altruistic wacky\""]
["01:26,040","01:31,380","\"Wacky eat cartoon antics or you shoot your friend with a missile. Nothing says altruism like\""]

["02:15,860","02:20,880","\"Once he's actually going up against the alien you can take his arms out and he'll be the best racer in the world\""]
["02:20,880","02:25,840","\"I don't think you can take your arms out of a strange egg and I thought that was the whole point. Don't you know who Dini?\""]
["02:25,840","02:30,000","\"That's true. Yeah, he did it all the time\""]
