["08:30,500","08:31,000","\"What?\""]
["08:31,000","08:34,600","\"Where somebody will say something like important or relevant to the plot.\""]
["08:34,600","08:39,300","\"But because the plot can't continue if the other character acknowledges that,\""]
["08:39,300","08:41,600","\"they'll just ignore it and say something else.\""]
["08:41,600","08:42,300","\"Oh really?\""]
["08:42,300","08:44,100","\"And it bugs the shit out of me.\""]

["09:57,880","10:00,280","\"Because he doesn't have a personality, he doesn't do anything.\""]
["10:00,280","10:03,080","\"Is that true? He has that.\""]
["10:03,080","10:04,280","\"He has his purple aura.\""]

["10:10,680","10:14,180","\"I don't know, give him some motivations to why he's attacking the country.\""]
