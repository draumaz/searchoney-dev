["00:58,760","01:00,880","\"I don't like that in the video game.\""]
["01:00,880","01:04,200","\"It's part of her character.\""]

["01:32,600","01:33,440","\"I wouldn't do that.\""]
["01:33,440","01:34,440","\"You could do it!\""]
["01:34,440","01:38,160","\"This probably has more gameplay than the actual game.\""]
["01:38,160","01:40,920","\"You can skip it.\""]
["01:40,920","01:42,320","\"I appreciate a good hand tug.\""]

["02:36,000","02:37,600","\"What do the cameras zoom in on there?\""]
["02:37,600","02:43,000","\"I think they're trying to make it look like candid.\""]
["02:43,000","02:44,300","\"Like a handheld thing.\""]
["02:44,300","02:48,300","\"Oh no she got stabbed.\""]

["03:14,300","03:21,900","\"This is- I've never- I've never played this one before, so this is a severe change of uh- what I'm used to.\""]
["03:21,900","03:23,900","\"The last one I played was three.\""]
