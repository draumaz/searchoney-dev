["00:05,560","00:08,560","\"I kind of unironically like this sequence.\""]
["00:08,560","00:10,160","\"Yeah, that's cool.\""]
["00:10,160","00:11,520","\"Kinda ripped me off, though.\""]
["00:11,520","00:12,520","\"*chuckles*\""]
["00:12,520","00:15,360","\"I-I think that's actually sorta cool.\""]
["00:15,360","00:18,240","\"I don't know if this invented that, but...\""]
["00:18,240","00:19,800","\"Nah, the Matrix did.\""]
["00:19,800","00:21,400","\"No, Matrix never did that, did it?\""]
["00:21,400","00:22,080","\"What?\""]
["00:22,080","00:22,840","\"Where it's like...\""]
["00:22,840","00:24,840","\"It's like a frozen scene and then...\""]
["00:24,840","00:29,080","\"And every time something obscures the camera, the scene changes slightly.\""]
["00:29,080","00:32,720","\"Yeah, oh, that's what it's doing. Yeah, okay, sorry see\""]
["00:32,720","00:35,880","\"That is cool. I think that's kind of neat\""]
["00:35,880","00:40,440","\"I don't know the reason for doing it like it didn't serve any purpose\""]
["00:40,440","00:42,880","\"He just killed this random guy operating a crane\""]
["00:42,880","00:49,080","\"But it's a cool shot and he lit he leaps he leaps away. I love Marlow Briggs\""]
["00:49,080","00:53,000","\"He's definitely the most iconic cool character I've ever seen\""]
["00:53,000","00:58,680","\"Actually wait, no, he's interchangeable with literally any human being ever born\""]
["00:58,680","01:04,920","\"It's not true. Just every buff human being ever born every buff-alled human being\""]
["01:04,920","01:08,880","\"It's weird how they just showed some things moving but\""]
["01:08,880","01:15,480","\"Yeah, I love that little mask. I think it looks cool. I was confusing at the very least\""]
["01:15,480","01:17,580","\"He's your zany sidekick\""]
["01:17,580","01:19,520","\"Forged you fire\""]
["01:19,520","01:21,520","\"Well, Tomar. We were both on point\""]
["01:24,200","01:29,020","\"Also now I'm kind of tired of it. I know they've been doing it for like a half hour\""]
["01:29,020","01:33,940","\"Well, they stopped it right when you got sick and cool. You got another achievement\""]
["01:33,940","01:41,960","\"Within the same cutscene. I love achievements. I showed into my friends and they take on coo I\""]
["01:41,960","01:49,940","\"Actually get irrationally mad whenever anything like actually important happens in a video game like she really lies on it\""]
["01:49,940","01:51,940","\"Yeah, yeah, me too. It actually\""]
["01:52,980","01:57,420","\"Really frustrates me especially if it's like a character dies or something like that\""]
["01:57,420","02:01,740","\"Yeah, it's just like like I get like actually like weirdly like\""]
["02:01,740","02:07,440","\"I remember having a fucking moment when achievements have always been this weird just like\""]
["02:07,440","02:11,900","\"Brain manipulation thing like there's no real reason for them\""]
["02:11,900","02:17,600","\"Like I if you if you want to have like achievements built into your game in some way fine\""]
["02:18,020","02:21,620","\"At least then you have the freedom to not make it do like a pop-up\""]
["02:21,620","02:27,180","\"Overlay on top of everything. I hate notifications like in general\""]
["02:27,180","02:32,140","\"Yes, like the only thing that I ever have notified me is like phone phone stuff\""]
["02:32,140","02:39,420","\"Like nothing else will ever pop up or make sound or anything on any of my devices and that in particular\""]
["02:39,420","02:46,300","\"bothers the fuck out of me. Oh my god, so this is you with an upside down perspective and I'm hanging from a helicopter\""]
["02:46,300","02:48,300","\"Cool. I like a lot of these things.\""]
["02:48,300","02:49,300","\"That's crazy.\""]
["02:49,300","02:53,920","\"But no, I'm the same. I have everything muted and I don't even have it like light up the\""]
["02:53,920","02:57,540","\"screen with like orange or anything like that. I just check it when I check it.\""]
["02:57,540","03:02,140","\"But you know what the annoying thing about that is most people don't do that so they\""]
["03:02,140","03:04,980","\"think you're like ignoring them sometimes.\""]
["03:04,980","03:05,980","\"That's true.\""]
["03:05,980","03:10,740","\"It's just like, well, I don't like if I didn't have that all that shit muted, I'd go crazy.\""]
["03:10,740","03:16,260","\"That's why I just I just I just hate people and then they're like, oh, of course you\""]
["03:16,260","03:17,260","\"wouldn't respond to me.\""]
["03:17,260","03:22,100","\"Well, I mean, I do like being notified if I'm getting like a DM on discord or like a\""]
["03:22,100","03:23,100","\"text.\""]
["03:23,100","03:24,100","\"I don't.\""]

["03:26,100","03:27,100","\"I don't.\""]
["03:27,100","03:32,060","\"I think like Chris, if you were like suffocating and needed needed fucking the Heinlich maneuver\""]
["03:32,060","03:35,620","\"and you sent me a discord message and it like popped up.\""]
["03:35,620","03:37,860","\"Yeah, I'd be actually mad.\""]
["03:37,860","03:38,860","\"Yeah, I know.\""]
["03:38,860","03:42,660","\"Sorry, I didn't give you the Heinlich maneuver the last time.\""]
["03:42,660","03:44,700","\"That's fine, dude.\""]
["03:44,700","03:46,900","\"If I need a contact someone I'll do it by phone.\""]

["03:47,400","03:49,000","\"Uhh.\""]
["03:49,000","03:49,800","\"Look at that.\""]
["03:49,800","03:50,900","\"Isn't he wonderful?\""]
["03:50,900","03:54,600","\"You know, they've only started doing this now because they realized they could save animation.\""]
["03:54,600","03:55,700","\"That's the only reason.\""]
["03:55,700","03:56,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:56,400","03:59,200","\"That is a very good point.\""]
["03:59,200","04:00,700","\"There they are.\""]
["04:00,700","04:04,300","\"I swear, like, they would have been doing this from the beginning otherwise.\""]
["04:04,300","04:06,500","\"Yeah, no, it definitely doesn't seem like a choice.\""]
["04:06,500","04:07,800","\"It seems like something that...\""]
["04:07,800","04:10,400","\"I don't know, this game just kind of goes as it goes.\""]
["04:10,400","04:12,900","\"They blew their whole animation budget earlier.\""]
["04:12,900","04:19,500","\"So then when it came to do pet scenes, they're like, uh, we'll just do something artsy. Yep, maybe\""]
["04:19,500","04:23,580","\"I'm not I'm not really sure honestly. This is the kind of game that just like\""]
["04:23,580","04:28,620","\"It's it's so scatterbrained that it just kind of changes on a dime\""]
["04:28,620","04:33,820","\"It's like oh and then we'll have a fucking sequence where you're in a helicopter upside down and then a crane will be there\""]
["04:33,820","04:37,100","\"And then you'll be on a real shooter and now there's bugs and I don't know\""]
["04:37,100","04:41,540","\"It's just it's just fucking all over the place. Oh, I got to throw a spirit knife check this out\""]
["04:41,540","04:49,420","\"That's the thing I do now. Oh, yes, of course the class experience you're collecting little souls\""]
["04:49,420","04:54,980","\"Polyticu\""]
["04:54,980","04:56,700","\"Shiboba\""]
["04:56,700","04:58,700","\"Yes, the god of Subalba\""]
["04:58,700","05:04,620","\"Cool, you got an achievement. That's the this this guy's gonna pod race in the next scene\""]
["05:04,620","05:07,780","\"That's who Subalba is yeah, I forgot\""]
["05:09,460","05:12,540","\"Little Anakin is probably the best character in that whole franchise\""]
["05:12,540","05:19,860","\"He makes me grin a big green grin. You know that kid was like fucked up after that movie. Yeah\""]
["05:19,860","05:24,380","\"No, he not only that kid, but the guy who played Jar Jar Binks\""]
["05:24,380","05:28,100","\"Yeah, like fucked up like from all the shit that they got publicly. Yeah\""]
["05:28,100","05:33,600","\"It was like actually crazy because he voiced a fucking cartoon rabbit that nobody liked\""]
["05:33,600","05:36,700","\"You know what else did he do besides that? I\""]
["05:37,540","05:42,180","\"Think he actually came from theater. Oh, I see yeah, no Jake Lloyd\""]
["05:42,180","05:46,620","\"He got into like a high-speed car chase see how that would turn you off from from film forever\""]
["05:46,620","05:48,300","\"I\""]
["05:48,300","05:50,300","\"Will yeah, I've said before\""]
["05:50,300","05:54,460","\"George Lucas should have thought about that character a little harder maybe\""]
["05:54,460","05:57,980","\"Alright, I don't even know what the fucks have\""]
["05:57,980","06:06,620","\"I feel so bad for Jake Lloyd though is that the the Anakin kids\""]
["06:06,620","06:14,380","\"That's gonna be the running joke now. Do not call me choo-choo. Yeah. Oh, I can't go down and kill those construction workers just doing their jobs. I\""]
["06:14,380","06:20,500","\"Mean they're just doing their jobs, but like I don't know they're doing it for a bad cause, you know\""]
["06:20,500","06:25,160","\"Yeah, exactly structure is obviously evil. I wanted to capitate them for that\""]
["06:25,160","06:28,380","\"You saying that if you were if you were\""]
["06:28,380","06:31,300","\"sent back in time\""]
["06:31,620","06:35,720","\"To Auschwitz you would you would spare the ones that aren't actually?\""]
["06:35,720","06:41,520","\"Shootin no, you know what I actually do wonder what is the most minuscule nothing job\""]
["06:41,520","06:45,300","\"You could do for Hitler and still have people think you're evil for doing it like\""]
["06:45,300","06:50,640","\"Like if you were a Hitler's plumber would people consider you to be evil. I think as long as you liked him\""]
["06:50,640","06:55,360","\"Right, no, no, but you can just be like no. I don't like I'm just doing my I'm just plumbing his shit\""]
["06:55,360","06:57,360","\"I was just falling orders\""]

["07:03,520","07:10,400","\"Guess you couldn't use the excuse of I don't know who the guy was the revolutionaries are all like if you'd failed to fix his toilet\""]
["07:10,400","07:14,140","\"He would have had to hold in his poop and maybe gotten some sort of weird infection\""]
["07:14,140","07:17,040","\"That is kind of a moral dilemma if you really think about it\""]
["07:17,040","07:18,360","\"Would you fix his toilet?\""]
["07:18,360","07:23,560","\"Toilet if you were just hired to do a job. Yeah, you walk in you don't even know who you're going to but you walk in there\""]

["07:33,560","07:37,400","\"And then fucking shitting all day\""]
["07:37,400","07:39,880","\"Would you do it, tomer?\""]
["07:39,880","07:41,880","\"Would you clog unclog it?\""]
["07:41,880","07:44,280","\"No, I wouldn't unclog Hitler's toilet.\""]
["07:44,280","07:46,040","\"Would you feed him a poop though?\""]
["07:46,040","07:48,600","\"Would you, would you like say you unclogged it?\""]
["07:48,600","07:51,560","\"But really you've just taken all the poop put it in a little baggy\""]
["07:51,560","07:57,480","\"I mean, I think I'd say I unclogged it and rigged it with some sort of weird like time-lapse trap.\""]
["07:57,480","07:58,920","\"Time-lapse trap.\""]
["07:58,920","08:04,760","\"I'd like to think I'm a very ingenuity plumber who can like make little MacGyver trap for pipes.\""]
["08:04,760","08:10,760","\"Yeah, you could maybe make like a little like pressurized thing where if he sits on the toilet,\""]
["08:10,760","08:17,080","\"it sets off a pressure plate and then all the poop from the plumbing gets shot up his ass at a really, really high...\""]
["08:17,080","08:19,800","\"No, you're speaking my language.\""]
["08:19,800","08:23,360","\"I put a little spy cam in there looking up. Wait, that was Hebrew, right?\""]
["08:23,360","08:29,020","\"Yeah, I think so Hebrew. I don't know. I was just trying to make a stupid one did she brew\""]
["08:29,020","08:32,480","\"How dare you oh\""]
["08:32,480","08:38,520","\"By the device whose whole job it is to push you got killed by a crash baneku trap\""]
["08:38,520","08:41,520","\"It's pretty zany\""]
["08:41,520","08:45,480","\"This game is just crash baneku it meets God of war. It's true\""]
["08:45,480","08:49,240","\"That's what a baneku looks like it just looks like a weird long-nosed rat\""]
["08:49,240","08:51,660","\"I like bandi-cooch look at that thing I\""]
["08:51,660","08:57,000","\"Like it showed on screen. I actually will show it on screen\""]
["08:57,000","09:02,920","\"I unironically am fond of that creature. I'm just gonna say a well of quashbany coot a wove him\""]
["09:02,920","09:05,260","\"They were gonna call him a Willie the wombat\""]
["09:05,260","09:10,320","\"That would have been a terrible mistake. I know crash bandi-coo is perfect. It's weird\""]
["09:10,320","09:16,240","\"That was definitely a 90s exec call to like nobody was a place of fucking thing called Willie the wall\""]
["09:16,240","09:17,300","\"- That's right.\""]
["09:17,300","09:18,620","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:18,620","09:19,820","\"- Sometimes they are.\""]
["09:19,820","09:20,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:20,660","09:25,700","\"- That's like we were talking about that the other day,\""]
["09:25,700","09:28,100","\"I think when we were talking about Dragon Ball,\""]
["09:28,100","09:32,460","\"where it's like the best arc is Cell, I think.\""]
["09:32,460","09:33,660","\"- I think it's Frieza.\""]
["09:33,660","09:34,980","\"- But Cell's still pretty good, or--\""]
["09:34,980","09:36,380","\"- I was gonna say I like Cell,\""]
["09:36,380","09:39,180","\"but Cell is like very haphazard,\""]
["09:39,180","09:41,380","\"and it really wasn't planned at all.\""]
["09:41,380","09:43,260","\"- Well, that's why it's like that\""]
["09:43,260","09:45,980","\"is because the fucking producers kept telling him,\""]
["09:45,980","09:53,860","\"We don't like that change it. Yeah, I always love freezes arc. Yeah, I'm actually I'm also a bigger freeze arc fan like\""]
["09:53,860","10:00,360","\"I'd be totally content if if I lived in a world where Dragon Ball just ended right after namming\""]
["10:00,360","10:06,820","\"I'd be fine with that. I was kind of yeah. What when it did end there. I was like that rock. I would yeah fucking\""]
["10:06,820","10:09,060","\"I liked Vegeta's a lark in that\""]
["10:09,540","10:16,960","\"Frieza saga. Yeah, he gets like the ultimate redemption arc and then promptly goes back to being a piece of shit husband\""]
["10:16,960","10:21,320","\"Yeah, he's really good at ruining characters. You enjoyed like\""]
["10:21,320","10:28,820","\"Like Chi Chi's so fucking annoying in Dragon Ball Z. Yeah, she's like she's a completely different character Dragon Ball\""]
["10:28,820","10:31,020","\"She's horrible and Dragon Ball Z\""]
["10:31,020","10:33,860","\"Yeah, they made her a massive bitch\""]
["10:34,380","10:38,860","\"She's kind of perfect though. Yeah, no, I'm not saying she doesn't you know\""]
["10:38,860","10:42,540","\"I don't remember her being a particularly big character in Dragon Ball, but\""]
["10:42,540","10:46,520","\"She was just like she was a small child told her everyone knows that\""]
["10:46,520","10:59,360","\"Also little you dumb asshole you don't like fucking dulce learn how to fucking absorb information learn how to fucking\""]
["11:00,020","11:07,860","\"Get enticed in content. Yeah, all the red ribbon army stuff was really fun and then like all the king piccolo stuff was really cool\""]
["11:07,860","11:13,380","\"I don't know. I feel like everything I made is better than all of Dragon Ball. So it's whatever\""]
["11:13,380","11:17,080","\"Well, that is a shitty picture. I wouldn't hang that there\""]
["11:17,080","11:21,980","\"If you wouldn't hang a picture of yourself in the middle of a founder. Maybe James Hahn\""]
["11:27,260","11:29,860","\"I need to look up if that's really Jameson.\""]
["11:29,860","11:31,460","\"That's bothering you that much.\""]
["11:31,460","11:33,060","\"Yeah it sounds just like him.\""]
["11:33,060","11:35,160","\"I actually don't know who the fuck he is.\""]
["11:35,160","11:36,860","\"The duck from Kung Fu Panda,\""]
