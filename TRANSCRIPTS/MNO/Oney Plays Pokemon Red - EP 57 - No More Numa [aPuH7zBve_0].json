["00:07,400","00:09,000","\"That's the sound I always make.\""]
["00:09,000","00:12,000","\"Whenever I think of Pokemon fights, I always think of Zubat's cry.\""]
["00:12,000","00:13,400","\"That's 'cause he's the most...\""]
["00:13,400","00:13,900","\"Bat.\""]
["00:13,900","00:15,800","\"He's probably the thing you run into the most, yeah.\""]
["00:15,800","00:17,000","\"He's the most bat in the whole game.\""]
["00:17,000","00:18,000","\"It's true.\""]
["00:18,000","00:22,000","\"If there was ever a bat that you had to pull out a pock, it would be Zubat.\""]
["00:22,000","00:23,000","\"Mm-mm.\""]
["00:23,000","00:24,000","\"*Ding*\""]
["00:24,000","00:25,000","\"Whoa.\""]
["00:25,000","00:26,000","\"Oh, TM17.\""]
["00:26,000","00:27,000","\"What do you think that is?\""]
["00:27,000","00:29,000","\"That's a publisher that made worms.\""]
["00:29,000","00:35,960","\"That's team 17. Yeah team 17. Oh, it's on neck\""]
["00:35,960","00:43,880","\"Could you please catch that fucking on it? He looks really mad. He does. He's like fucking serious. He's literally what are you doing?\""]
["00:43,880","00:47,380","\"He's looking at his own tail. He doesn't like existing\""]
["00:47,380","00:52,760","\"He's right in front of his eyes. He's focusing so hard on it. You find a little spider on it\""]
["00:53,920","00:55,920","\"It was furious at this thing.\""]
["00:55,920","00:57,920","\"This living creature allided on his body.\""]
["00:57,920","01:01,920","\"Did I really get a random encounter on the tile where the trainer saw me?\""]
["01:01,920","01:02,920","\"It looked like it.\""]
["01:02,920","01:03,920","\"I wonder what that does.\""]
["01:03,920","01:04,920","\"I hope that doesn't fuck up the game.\""]
["01:04,920","01:05,920","\"I hope not.\""]
["01:05,920","01:06,920","\"Let's see.\""]
["01:06,920","01:07,920","\"Probably not.\""]
["01:07,920","01:08,920","\"Swin!\""]
["01:08,920","01:09,920","\"It's Juglar.\""]
["01:09,920","01:12,920","\"Aw, there he is.\""]
["01:12,920","01:13,920","\"I like him.\""]
["01:13,920","01:14,920","\"I do too.\""]
["01:14,920","01:15,920","\"He's fun.\""]
["01:15,920","01:16,920","\"I'm glad.\""]
["01:16,920","01:17,920","\"I'll be careful.\""]
["01:17,920","01:19,920","\"He's going to use side beam or something.\""]
["01:19,920","01:21,920","\"I would have guessed for the Detective Pikachu movie\""]
["01:21,920","01:26,160","\"Maybe they were gonna push certain Pokemon out of the limelight just because they're fucking too weird.\""]
["01:26,160","01:27,160","\"Too traffic.\""]
["01:27,160","01:28,480","\"Yeah, no, that's not what I meant.\""]
["01:28,480","01:30,960","\"Yeah, I would not have expected them to use Mr. Mime.\""]
["01:30,960","01:31,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:31,960","01:34,080","\"They're probably gonna focus it around generation 1.\""]
["01:34,080","01:36,520","\"What would you do if they tried to target that audience?\""]
["01:36,520","01:38,360","\"What would you do if they cut the scene?\""]
["01:38,360","01:39,520","\"You pissed.\""]
["01:39,520","01:42,440","\"That's what they cut the scene.\""]
["01:42,440","01:45,800","\"And instead they replaced it with a raw footage so there's no Mr. Mime.\""]
["01:45,800","01:48,280","\"It's just Pikachu talking to no one.\""]
["01:48,280","01:52,600","\"What if they cut the scene and replaced it with a Pokemon let's play that'd be awful\""]
["01:52,600","01:58,740","\"I'd watch it. I mean I'd eat who would want to watch poke at a three\""]
["01:58,740","02:01,780","\"We saw a bunch of people sitting in a room just watching twitch streams\""]
["02:01,780","02:06,840","\"Which is weird to me because it's like you this is a limited time event. You're just in a room\""]
["02:06,840","02:11,600","\"Hey a lot of people go there just to meet friends. That's true to I guess\""]
["02:11,600","02:16,680","\"Okay, what do you think of that tile it looks like you could walk on it, but you can't\""]
["02:17,680","02:19,940","\"See this button I need to hit what tile\""]
["02:19,940","02:23,840","\"That one over there. It's a wall. That's a wall\""]
["02:23,840","02:30,940","\"Why is it like that? Oh cuz you put the thing on the button you put the line on the coconut probably just\""]
["02:30,940","02:33,500","\"all up yeah\""]
["02:33,500","02:36,460","\"You put the lime in the coconut and you mess it all up. Yep\""]
["02:36,460","02:41,800","\"Never going to do it. I just think you're so cute, you know no\""]
["02:41,800","02:45,280","\"But he's about to use hit no you know\""]
["02:46,120","02:49,200","\"You know, you know he used hip dysplasia\""]
["02:49,200","02:53,420","\"It displaces your hip. What does that mean? Yeah, but it failed\""]
["02:53,420","02:56,280","\"Displaced your\""]
["02:56,280","02:59,680","\"Yeah, exactly it affected something else. I am\""]
["02:59,680","03:04,560","\"Already mentioned it I think but I used to be able to crack my dick in the morning\""]
["03:04,560","03:08,400","\"I can't do it anymore. Oh, that's too bad. Why would you want to crack your dick every morning?\""]
["03:08,400","03:11,120","\"At the time it felt not bad\""]
["03:12,760","03:19,220","\"But then eventually it just broke clean off it probably was not a good idea like that might have that might be the reason\""]
["03:19,220","03:22,260","\"My dick is not a big fist anymore a\""]
["03:22,260","03:25,380","\"Fist now it's a little baby finger\""]
["03:25,380","03:30,300","\"Why was it\""]
["03:30,300","03:36,480","\"Curiously at the world used to be powerful there used to be five of it and it was clenched and I would pound people with it\""]
["03:36,480","03:41,280","\"I kind of like that idea. That's kind of fun. You're gay. That's it's no. It's like\""]
["03:42,120","03:48,320","\"It's like the guy with the drill for a dick on from dead leaves. That's kind of cool. He was funny sacrificed himself\""]
["03:48,320","03:50,320","\"Here's lollipop man\""]
["03:50,320","03:54,920","\"If um if your dick had a tiny little baby face on it\""]
["03:54,920","04:01,760","\"That smiled and laughed and you took out of your pants. I'd be upset that yeah, would you ever have sex again?\""]
["04:01,760","04:08,520","\"I probably not I don't know I don't know I actually don't know what I would do what what if you go get it removed\""]
["04:08,520","04:14,580","\"No, what if you showed it to a doctor and he said don't worry it's it's not sentient it just looks like it is\""]
["04:14,580","04:17,880","\"I'd say I don't care. It's still be weird. I did the fuck off cuz it's making go out\""]
["04:17,880","04:21,880","\"I would still be thinking about babies. I keep asking for a baba every night\""]
["04:21,880","04:27,240","\"I can't sleep what if the doctor says with this one injection I can fix it so it stops moving and making noise\""]
["04:27,240","04:30,620","\"And now you don't have to worry about it. I said get rid of it. I have a little baby face\""]
["04:30,620","04:32,620","\"I don't care what if he says\""]
["04:32,620","04:37,220","\"Pull a little baby. I get rid of a you're gonna lose 95% of sensitivity in your penis\""]
["04:37,220","04:44,120","\"Okay, fine at least it's not that's no you wouldn't I probably would cuz if you had a little human baby face on your dick\""]
["04:44,120","04:49,340","\"You really wouldn't go get surgery to get it removed if the doctor said he can make put it to sleep and\""]
["04:49,340","04:55,940","\"So it is alive. It's not killing it now. No, it's not like it looks like he's sleeping now though\""]
