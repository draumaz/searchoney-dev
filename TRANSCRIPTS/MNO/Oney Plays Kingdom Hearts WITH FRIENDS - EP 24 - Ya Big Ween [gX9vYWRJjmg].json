["03:24,380","03:29,060","\"But every time I hear I gets get sick of her now. It's cuz she's in everything\""]

["03:39,040","03:43,280","\"It's like fuck. It's also when they're overused. They try to get them to do the same. Yeah\""]
["03:43,280","03:47,820","\"Yeah, that's the worst thing is that people fucking direct them to do what they before\""]
["03:47,820","03:53,680","\"It's the same when they have a temporary audio track for music and they're like just make it sound similar to the one before\""]
["03:53,680","03:56,320","\"Yeah, it's like okay terrible\""]
["03:56,320","04:00,620","\"There's some people with voices where you're just like yeah, you were born to be a voice actor though\""]
["04:00,620","04:04,420","\"Like that Bobby Hill lady. Yeah, she's a really unique voice\""]
["04:04,420","04:12,640","\"Do you think there's any kid who played this and they had a raging boner like it was their sexual awakening the fact\""]

["04:21,860","04:29,100","\"It's a different situation entirely. That's a hypothetical by the way. That's not real. Why is he believing this stupid shit?\""]
["04:29,100","04:35,160","\"I'm dumb as he because it's the for the plot. You know no way you're talking about Jim Cummings being noticed and everything\""]
["04:35,160","04:38,720","\"Yes, I noticed that Phil kid and every like Phil and love Phil\""]
["04:39,000","04:44,600","\"That that voice isn't everything. He's the little boy in the episode of Futurama and he says oh, he has yeah\""]

["05:05,960","05:07,520","\"Yeah, I don't hear them that often.\""]
["05:07,520","05:09,200","\"- A lot of those voice actors fell off.\""]
["05:09,200","05:10,840","\"- I don't want to recognize anybody.\""]
["05:10,840","05:13,080","\"- That's 'cause they're so fucking rich at this point.\""]
["05:13,080","05:16,360","\"- I know that that's not an opinion anybody would ever,\""]
["05:16,360","05:18,320","\"people like to recognize things.\""]
["05:18,320","05:19,800","\"They enjoy that, but I--\""]
["05:19,800","05:22,080","\"- I'm trying to think of a voice actor that's fooled me\""]
["05:22,080","05:24,880","\"where I'm like, whoa, he does that for me.\""]
["05:24,880","05:26,280","\"- That's happened a couple of times.\""]
["05:26,280","05:27,720","\"- Yeah, I'm trying to think.\""]
["05:27,720","05:29,840","\"- You didn't know that was the rock when he saw Moana.\""]
["05:29,840","05:32,080","\"- I didn't, I didn't think that was him.\""]
["05:32,080","05:32,920","\"- That's good.\""]
["05:32,920","05:35,600","\"- The dog walker said he has an awful singing voice.\""]
["05:35,600","05:36,440","\"does he?\""]
["05:36,440","05:38,160","\"- It sounded fine to me.\""]
["05:38,160","05:39,000","\"- The rock?\""]
["05:39,000","05:41,200","\"- That's 'cause you're not a vocalist.\""]

["05:48,760","05:50,520","\"You can't get any finer than that.\""]
["05:50,520","05:52,000","\"- The thing about Doug Walker is he has\""]
["05:52,000","05:53,880","\"a, he's like amazing vibrato,\""]
["05:53,880","05:55,680","\"but he can't hit notes, which is really weird.\""]
["05:55,680","05:58,800","\"- No, I don't think he knows what he's capable of either.\""]
["05:58,800","06:00,760","\"- He has amazing vibrato.\""]
["06:00,760","06:04,520","\"- 'Cause he, he did, he shrieked about his penis.\""]

["06:59,800","07:01,800","\"I'll put my characters on top of it.\""]
["07:01,800","07:03,360","\"The first time I heard that song, I was like,\""]

["07:07,100","07:09,800","\"But then the more I listen to it, the more I like coming along to it.\""]
["07:09,800","07:10,800","\"I like it.\""]
["07:10,800","07:13,300","\"I like the audience about how we can't use the dog walker joke now.\""]
["07:13,300","07:14,300","\"Why?\""]
["07:14,300","07:16,300","\"You were the one that brought it up!\""]
["07:16,300","07:18,300","\"Because, uh, what's his name good?\""]

["07:27,800","07:29,300","\"Did we ever say dog walker in an episode?\""]
["07:29,300","07:30,540","\"- It's just so probably not.\""]
["07:30,540","07:32,580","\"- I think if anything, it might have been in one of your--\""]
["07:32,580","07:34,580","\"- It's not the most original of jokes.\""]
["07:34,580","07:36,060","\"- I thought it was a good joke.\""]
["07:36,060","07:38,620","\"- It's funny, but it's not like it's genius.\""]
["07:38,620","07:39,980","\"- Well, I'm not the one who brought it up.\""]
["07:39,980","07:40,820","\"Julian is.\""]
["07:40,820","07:43,060","\"- The Ding Dong a long, long time ago,\""]

["07:57,180","08:04,220","\"And that's why he's bad at everything. Yeah, that's me. He's trying to fight things. He's not bad at everything. He does bad\""]
["08:04,220","08:07,820","\"What is it? What is it good at? It's good at putting out content. I\""]
["08:07,820","08:13,240","\"Guess that's true. That's extremely true. Yes, and look at fantasy is\""]
["08:13,240","08:18,500","\"Is a big anything? Yes, it does. He's good at shitting. Do you really go?\""]
["08:18,500","08:25,500","\"Look you could shoot on him every day. You could shit on him. You could shit on him all you want\""]
["08:25,500","08:30,140","\"He puts out a fucking half an hour video every week. That shit's hard. I don't care how shitty it is\""]
["08:30,140","08:34,700","\"Yeah, but doesn't he also pay people? Yes, I don't care. It's still hard to organize all that\""]
["08:34,700","08:41,960","\"What what is what's going on here? You have a dog walkers flying across the screen see oh come on wait what?\""]
["08:41,960","08:49,660","\"What what's happening? I don't know I guess because I chose the route that monster was on now it forces me to take it I guess\""]
["08:54,180","08:56,180","\"Like those weird twos\""]
["08:56,180","08:58,460","\"People think we're talking about\""]
["08:58,460","09:04,140","\"Any of that they're like, oh you're talking about the character. No, he's done out of character videos\""]
["09:04,140","09:09,840","\"He does yeah, he does if not more. Yeah, his content is his is just him\""]
["09:09,840","09:14,220","\"That's why it's disappointing is you to see you like oh he actually is just kind of a dope\""]

["09:27,060","09:32,340","\"That's true. We did that with that that episode just went up recently where we were talking about internet critics\""]
["09:32,340","09:38,900","\"Yeah, people didn't like it. That's because we didn't have the whole thought put through the video. It got cut down\""]
["09:38,900","09:43,740","\"For clarity on that\""]
["09:43,740","09:48,740","\"That whole discussion was we're talking about a specific person. Yes, which isn't even Doug\""]
["09:48,820","09:56,580","\"Which was criticizing something in specific which was art because it's somebody who's proven they have no idea what they're talking about\""]
