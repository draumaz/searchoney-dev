["09:48,460","09:58,100","\"He did say that. Be sure to give him my very best wishes. I will, but do you know\""]
["09:58,100","10:00,100","\"I can find Riku?\""]

["18:02,900","18:06,900","\"The darkness.\""]
["18:06,900","18:10,900","\"And then the lock appears over Squidward's head and you have to unlock him.\""]

["18:53,340","18:57,100","\"He just throws in the trash\""]
["18:57,100","19:00,180","\"And Spongebob doesn't even come into it at all\""]
["19:00,180","19:05,880","\"So the whole time was a waste of time the first thing you would see in the world is like Patrick doubled over\""]
["19:05,880","19:09,840","\"We're just shaking and he wouldn't say anything. He would just stand there and make faces at you\""]
["19:09,840","19:15,780","\"And then would run out of the shot. I think the chum buckets a better place for at the start. It's dank and dreary\""]
["19:15,780","19:18,960","\"Then you get up in the open world of the\""]
