["01:17,940","01:19,540","\"It's artistic.\""]

["01:21,040","01:22,040","\"Listen.\""]
["01:22,040","01:24,040","\"I mean, that's got to be a choice, right?\""]
["01:24,040","01:25,740","\"It's definitely a choice.\""]
["01:25,740","01:28,940","\"I think they might have fucked up the music choice here.\""]

["01:52,140","01:54,240","\"They're just making sure that they do a trade-seize.\""]

["02:18,740","02:24,780","\"This is gonna take forever at the rate they're moving. Oh, they're getting there seem close, but then you see the camera far away\""]
["02:24,780","02:26,780","\"They were not this close.\""]
["02:26,780","02:30,780","\"Listen, sometimes life can move at the blink of an eye-tomb, are you never know?\""]
["02:30,780","02:31,780","\"Okay.\""]
["02:31,780","02:35,780","\"That's the point of this. We're all supposed to be clenched up.\""]

["02:51,780","02:53,780","\"I shot into baboo!\""]
["02:53,780","02:58,020","\"We could have used her for social media.\""]

["03:01,740","03:05,500","\"And she's just standing there in the middle of this.\""]
["03:05,500","03:07,180","\">> My social media manager.\""]
["03:07,180","03:09,860","\">> The thing that Virgil can get the headshot, but\""]

["03:31,460","03:33,460","\"So he was the evil being\""]
["03:33,460","03:36,400","\"He was the explosion all along\""]
["03:36,400","03:42,700","\"They can't wait for a kill for you get a new thing. I'll see that in real life, dude\""]
["03:42,700","03:47,420","\"Dude at some point we're all gonna get nuke\""]
["03:48,300","03:49,300","\"I hope not.\""]
["03:49,300","03:53,580","\"We can legitimately say things like Logan Paul died from nuke.\""]

["03:55,580","03:57,580","\"As it's all--\""]
["03:57,580","03:58,580","\"Logan Paul died from nuke.\""]
["03:58,580","03:59,580","\"We all died from nuke.\""]
["03:59,580","04:01,940","\"I know, but at least we get to say it.\""]
["04:01,940","04:04,940","\"Yeah, at least you get to say that in your last moments.\""]
["04:04,940","04:08,140","\"At least our children and grandkids will be able to say that.\""]
["04:08,140","04:09,140","\"[laughter]\""]
["04:09,140","04:13,020","\"And I mean, if California gets nuked, the whole world pretty much gets nuked, huh?\""]
["04:13,020","04:16,420","\"Yeah, if you die in California, you die in real life or whatever.\""]
["04:16,420","04:20,620","\"legitimately be able to say that Barbara Chandler got new.\""]
["04:20,620","04:22,660","\"Who? Barbara Chandler.\""]
["04:22,660","04:23,620","\"Who's that?\""]
["04:23,620","04:24,900","\"Chris Chan's mom.\""]
["04:24,900","04:26,500","\"Oh.\""]
["04:26,500","04:27,500","\"Barbara Chandler.\""]
["04:27,500","04:28,500","\"Wait, is that her name?\""]
["04:28,500","04:29,020","\"Is it?\""]
["04:29,020","04:29,860","\"I don't know.\""]
["04:29,860","04:33,340","\"You're driving this vehicle, right?\""]
["04:33,340","04:36,620","\"Why do you bring something up and then I get to burn and approve?\""]
["04:36,620","04:39,460","\"You fucking got us all on the Barbara Chandler Express,\""]
["04:39,460","04:40,980","\"and then you just fucking come right.\""]
["04:40,980","04:42,060","\"Maybe I'm fucking wrong.\""]
["04:42,060","04:43,300","\"I didn't look that up now.\""]
["04:43,300","04:44,620","\"You feel stupid.\""]
["04:44,620","04:45,700","\"We're doing an epic chase.\""]
["04:45,700","04:51,540","\"That looks pretty cool. Yeah, this is this is pretty neat. Oh actually do not remember this. I remembered him shooting the fetus\""]
["04:51,540","04:53,540","\"Oh, no, that's her name. I'm right\""]
["04:53,540","05:00,140","\"Yeah, I mean we were the ones that didn't know yeah, okay. I just wanted to make sure it's this\""]
["05:00,140","05:04,660","\"And no one here was ever arguing the point you guys are gaslighting little folks\""]
["05:04,660","05:07,780","\"We were arguing the point of bringing it up in the first place, but\""]
["05:12,220","05:16,920","\"What if every time you grabbed and pulled something heavy your life turned into a pre-rendered movie?\""]
["05:16,920","05:25,640","\"I'd be fine with it. I think my whole life is pretty rendered like it's still like jitter around badly like in file fantasy 7 good\""]
["05:25,640","05:31,220","\"I still love that. I thought that was the coolest shit what that they would jitter and twitch no like\""]
["05:31,220","05:36,720","\"Final Fantasy 7 they would overlay in-game models over cutscenes so you could run around in cutscenes\""]
["05:36,720","05:40,360","\"But it was like a lot of the time. They weren't synced up properly\""]
["05:40,360","05:45,420","\"So they would just start like you were on a green screen, but I don't think I've ever seen another game do that\""]
["05:45,420","05:53,200","\"It was pretty fun, they did have like those like pre-rendered backgrounds and shit. Yeah, that's why they did it\""]
["05:53,200","05:56,680","\"Yeah, it was always sort of the basis of how the game was built\""]
["05:56,680","06:02,360","\"Now that they can kind of do anything. It's like you don't see like weird ingenuity like that anymore\""]
["06:02,360","06:07,560","\"I think we're actually pretty close to being done with this game. What makes you say that the fact that the spits\""]
["06:07,560","06:09,160","\"- The stakes are so high. - Yes.\""]
["06:09,160","06:11,660","\"- And everyone's dying. - Absolutely.\""]
["06:11,660","06:12,500","\"- This is me.\""]
["06:12,500","06:14,300","\"- The only person that died was a bad guy.\""]
["06:14,300","06:15,740","\"- I'm trying a chart.\""]
["06:15,740","06:17,860","\"- Hey, she got a tumbler nose.\""]
["06:17,860","06:20,260","\"- Yeah, she sure does.\""]
["06:20,260","06:22,860","\"You've been eating that cocaine.\""]
["06:22,860","06:24,160","\"They're in the chalk zone.\""]
["06:24,160","06:27,400","\"(upbeat music)\""]
["06:27,400","06:30,760","\"- Aw, I wanted him to stay in the chalk world forever.\""]
["06:30,760","06:31,600","\"- Yeah, that would've been--\""]
["06:31,600","06:33,340","\"- You wanted him to be banished forever more.\""]
["06:33,340","06:35,180","\"Like, that's a pretty cool effect, honestly.\""]
["06:35,180","06:37,300","\"- It is, but why would you wish him\""]
["06:37,300","06:38,820","\"to be stuck in such a way.\""]
["06:38,820","06:39,740","\"I don't wanna be stuck.\""]
["06:39,740","06:42,820","\"I just wanna play around in the chalk world for a moment.\""]
["06:42,820","06:44,380","\"Okay, that's fair.\""]
["06:44,380","06:47,060","\"- Well, it's kinda the chalk, the chalk, the chalk's old.\""]
["06:47,060","06:48,940","\"- Rudy did have the chalk.\""]
["06:48,940","06:50,420","\"I wonder if when he got older,\""]
["06:50,420","06:52,860","\"he would just like draw ladies and fuck 'em.\""]
["06:52,860","06:54,540","\"(laughs)\""]
["06:54,540","06:57,900","\"- You should do that, that'd be a good pitch for a series.\""]
["06:57,900","06:59,500","\"- Adult Chalk Zone?\""]
["06:59,500","07:01,020","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:01,020","07:02,980","\"Like not necessarily specifically that,\""]
["07:02,980","07:04,340","\"but that would be one of the things\""]
["07:04,340","07:09,340","\"that they deal with is like, you know, if you create it\""]
["07:09,340","07:12,300","\"to what extent is it your responsibility\""]
["07:12,300","07:14,540","\"once it becomes sentient?\""]
["07:14,540","07:16,840","\"- Yeah, that is a question.\""]
["07:16,840","07:21,420","\"Wow, a building with wings.\""]
["07:21,420","07:24,680","\"I hope it flies away and I don't have to look at it anymore.\""]
["07:24,680","07:30,180","\"- The 9/11's getting pretty ambitious lately.\""]
["07:30,180","07:33,740","\"The reboot's pretty cool.\""]
["07:33,740","07:40,100","\"9/11 reboot yeah I don't want them to reboot that I want them to remaster it\""]
["07:40,100","07:46,260","\"the cheese kind of yeah because whenever you go back to look at it you're like\""]
["07:46,260","07:49,300","\"God these cameras suck\""]
["07:49,300","07:55,260","\"so you're you're you're for sure that 9/11 was only recorded in 4x3 you have to\""]
["07:55,260","07:58,860","\"admit it's kind of a shame that HD cameras came in like five years later\""]
["07:58,860","08:03,700","\"They've for sure done like a Titanic type movie about 9/11 by now, right?\""]
["08:03,700","08:07,960","\"There was that movie. Yeah, there was one with like Charlie Sheen in it, right?\""]
["08:07,960","08:14,560","\"And my Nicholas Cage. Really? Yeah, he's like a fireman. Huh? Like, oh look at all this 9/11\""]
["08:14,560","08:18,140","\"Time to put it out\""]
["08:18,140","08:20,460","\"It gets a big hose and sprays it down\""]
["08:20,460","08:23,660","\"Yes, this is the whole life-running video\""]
["08:23,660","08:27,620","\"That's fine\""]
["08:27,620","08:30,120","\"I'm ready to be rude. It was a good wrong guy\""]
["08:30,120","08:37,380","\"This is the hill I die on is Nicholas Cage in 9/11 is weird and silly\""]
["08:37,380","08:45,520","\"What we can't help the the terrorists have put a cause just a permanently associate big falling towers with 9/11\""]
["08:45,520","08:48,980","\"That's fair. Yeah, why couldn't they do something less?\""]
["08:48,980","08:52,720","\"The terrorists fault should have something less that you would see in day to day\""]
["08:53,020","08:59,580","\"Yeah, like egg curtains to be fair. No one remembers the Pentagon right because there's not a lot of Pentagon's around\""]
["08:59,580","09:03,540","\"Yeah, that's true. I don't think anybody really got hurt at the Pentagon\""]
["09:03,540","09:06,420","\"My sense of liberty got hurt\""]
["09:06,420","09:12,100","\"Because I knew that that Congress was happening. So what happens with Pentagon Congress?\""]
["09:12,100","09:17,200","\"Don't think so. I don't actually know what the Pentagon is for. I don't know what anything is\""]
["09:17,200","09:24,480","\"I think the Pentagon is is the headquarters of the US Army and a bunch of maybe a bunch of other security agencies\""]
["09:24,480","09:30,000","\"I don't but you know now I'm talking out of my ass. I just always thought that but I don't know if it's true\""]
["09:30,000","09:33,120","\"Why did they build it like a pentagon anyway?\""]
["09:33,120","09:38,400","\"It's supposed to use plain. It's supposed to be one of the most secure buildings in the country\""]
["09:38,400","09:40,560","\"They should have made it more like one of those just 4d cubes\""]
["09:40,560","09:45,400","\"Which is probably why we're crashing a plane into it didn't do much. They should have made it an optical illusion\""]
["09:45,400","09:51,980","\"Anyway, let's it should have made it a wooden chain puzzle. Yeah, that would have been cool security override\""]
["09:51,980","09:56,640","\"This is what happened to a security is the\""]
["09:56,640","10:02,660","\"headquarters of the state Department of the United States Department Department of Defense\""]
["10:02,660","10:06,040","\"Yeah, yeah, let's stop talking about the Pentagon. Let me get in this\""]
["10:06,040","10:11,640","\"Shut your fucking mouth. No one wants to know about the US or anything about it from now on\""]
["10:11,640","10:16,880","\"I don't know what these obsidian boulders country is countries a piece of shit and so are you oh?\""]
["10:16,880","10:19,680","\"I don't think so\""]
["10:19,680","10:26,400","\"This man is not a dream runner. He is a he has a mini dreamy. He's not running around that much\""]
["10:26,400","10:31,240","\"Yeah, I just fucked him up was that like did you see her back through that portal?\""]
["10:31,240","10:36,760","\"Yeah, he came in like through it and then I slashed him in the face. Did they use valve portal technology? Yes\""]
["10:39,320","10:46,240","\"To a more how-com portal it exists. Isn't that kind of crazy to think about the fact that portal is real?\""]
["10:46,240","10:52,160","\"I will say that the first time I saw the portals actually showing properly. What's on the other side kind of blew my mind\""]
["10:52,160","10:55,780","\"Yeah, no, I think them figuring that out was I\""]
["10:55,780","11:00,960","\"mean, I guess you're basically combining the features of like a camera with the\""]
["11:00,960","11:07,840","\"Because that's all ultimately what it is just that the other portal is acting like a camera and the viewport is the portal itself\""]
["11:08,960","11:13,440","\"But then you can also walk through it and then what you're viewing like a viewport is reality\""]
["11:13,440","11:16,180","\"No, I always thought it was really cool. I I\""]
["11:16,180","11:19,860","\"Know that people have talked about like how that technology works\""]
["11:19,860","11:26,660","\"Like as far as like the eye can see how they programmed it, but it's still really cool to me valve handles\""]
["11:26,660","11:29,840","\"Skyboxes and cameras in a really unique way\""]
["11:29,840","11:36,020","\"I miss when valve made video games. That was pretty cool. That was a good time. It was\""]
["11:37,280","11:39,280","\"Now they just make card games\""]
["11:39,280","11:47,680","\"You and me said I think that's the last thing me card games and me said the last thing they announced was like a dota-themed card game\""]
["11:47,680","11:53,200","\"Wasn't it I don't know who cares which is probably out by now, and I still am not ever gonna play it\""]
["11:53,200","11:57,840","\"How many how many card games need to exist before we just get rid of cards?\""]
["11:57,840","12:03,120","\"I'm tired of them. I think Gabe Newell's just fused to his toilet at this point\""]
["12:03,120","12:06,640","\"Is that the reason they're not making games?\""]
["12:06,640","12:08,400","\"The can't get him out of the world.\""]
["12:08,400","12:10,400","\"- It's not making a single game until you get me.\""]
["12:10,400","12:11,560","\"It's like Winnie the Pooh.\""]
["12:11,560","12:13,400","\"- This one's like in the hole.\""]
["12:13,400","12:15,200","\"- This one's my goal as an entrepreneur\""]
["12:15,200","12:16,680","\"to never leave my toilet.\""]
["12:16,680","12:18,000","\"Now that I've accomplished it,\""]
["12:18,000","12:20,200","\"you guys can all go home.\""]
["12:20,200","12:22,560","\"- It's his like sentient twin that's attached to him\""]
["12:22,560","12:25,240","\"or if they sniff him off of his toilet, they will both die.\""]
["12:25,240","12:26,720","\"- Do you hear that Gabe Newell has like\""]
["12:26,720","12:28,600","\"an extensive knife collection?\""]
["12:28,600","12:29,440","\"- Really?\""]
["12:29,440","12:31,160","\"- And he'll fucking kill you if you come in his house.\""]

["12:32,000","12:32,840","\"- Yeah.\""]
["12:32,840","12:33,680","\"- This is cool.\""]

["12:36,180","12:40,180","\"You're getting your true sequel to Chalk Zone.\""]
["12:40,180","12:47,180","\"But Tomar, did you know the Skybox's and Valve games are projected, like from a little tiny model on the map itself?\""]
["12:47,180","12:52,180","\"So if you run onto that little tiny space as a character, the character will be projected.\""]
["12:52,180","12:54,180","\"You'll see him up in the sky in the sky.\""]
["12:54,180","12:56,180","\"No, I had no idea that that was a thing.\""]
["12:56,180","13:02,180","\"I remember that was a trick for like Gmod videos. You could just like put a guy off the map and then he'd show up in the sky really huge.\""]
["13:02,180","13:08,060","\"Yeah, I think that's the same kind of camera trick they use for portal because for some reason they don't lose any resolution with their camera\""]
["13:08,060","13:12,460","\"Is this pretty cool? Do you know that Gordon Freeman was made out of Legos and not polygons?\""]
["13:12,460","13:15,140","\"They thought it would be fun to do\""]

["13:37,660","13:40,500","\"I tell you I don't think they could top that scene from the first\""]
["13:40,500","13:44,800","\"When those guys get sliced in the little cubes\""]
["13:44,800","13:51,740","\"That's like one of the most rewound like moments in any movie I think oh in cube no in a resident evil when they like jump\""]
["13:51,740","13:55,940","\"Through the lasers and get sliced into little ribbons. Yeah, there's a um, there's a movie\""]

["14:16,120","14:21,240","\"It's the most memorable part of the movie. Yep, or all the movies. Yeah, all of them combined\""]
["14:21,240","14:25,680","\"This guy needs to fucking leave me alone\""]
["14:29,280","14:35,800","\"If you ever do that again, sorry, isn't that weird how the guy in the second Resident Evil movie do you remember the wheelchair guy?\""]
["14:35,800","14:41,780","\"Who's like I'm just locking from my dog top remember that guy I never fucking watch those movies\""]
["14:41,780","14:47,040","\"Yeah, I never actually serious like I've watched some of the other sequels like in the background\""]
