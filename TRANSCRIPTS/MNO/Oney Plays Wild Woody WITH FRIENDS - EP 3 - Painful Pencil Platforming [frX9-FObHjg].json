["00:26,720","00:27,420","\"Thank you.\""]
["00:27,420","00:28,900","\"- That's my favorite. - That's a D-Spond quest.\""]
["00:28,900","00:31,300","\"- Two was my favorite too, and most people say no,\""]
["00:31,300","00:32,380","\"I like the first one.\""]
["00:32,380","00:33,220","\"- Not two, but best.\""]
["00:33,220","00:35,380","\"- That two improved on it, and I'm like every way.\""]
["00:35,380","00:36,620","\"This sounds good. - Why did you do that?\""]
["00:36,620","00:38,460","\"I'm sorry.\""]

["00:45,940","00:47,660","\"- I thought it was totally my fault first.\""]
["00:47,660","00:48,940","\"- I thought it was generally accepted\""]
["00:48,940","00:50,380","\"that two is the best one.\""]
["00:50,380","00:52,420","\"- That's what I figured, but no.\""]
["00:52,420","00:55,060","\"People will say the first one just 'cause they grew up with it.\""]
["00:55,060","00:57,180","\"- Yeah, two improves on everything and not only\""]
["00:57,180","01:01,660","\"the soundtrack is a lot better the level designs are better the secrets aren't as bullshit as the first game\""]
["01:01,660","01:04,860","\"It's just as a cooler like vibe to it. Yeah, it does\""]
["01:04,860","01:11,820","\"I like the pirate setting also all the levels in the first game look very similar. Yeah second game has more variety\""]
["01:11,820","01:14,540","\"the one thing I don't like about\""]
["01:14,540","01:17,500","\"the second one is um\""]
["01:17,500","01:23,460","\"I don't like the Bramble levels even though the music's really good. They're not that bad when I went back and played it\""]
["01:23,460","01:26,700","\"Really? Yeah, they're not that hard. I remember hating them when I was a kid\""]
["01:26,700","01:27,700","\"Oh, he fights.\""]
["01:27,700","01:31,900","\"I remember that game being a nightmare, but I've actually gone back to it and played\""]
["01:31,900","01:33,540","\"it almost every year.\""]
["01:33,540","01:35,660","\"I had it on a Game Boy Color.\""]
["01:35,660","01:41,420","\"I had Game Boy Pocket and it came with Donkey Kong Land 2, which is just country 2.\""]
["01:41,420","01:42,420","\"Yeah, it was like...\""]
["01:42,420","01:45,620","\"And I remember I got stuck because one of the levels, it was the level where the water\""]
["01:45,620","01:46,620","\"turns the lava.\""]
["01:46,620","01:47,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:47,620","01:49,500","\"But you can't see that on a black and white skin.\""]
["01:49,500","01:50,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:50,500","01:52,340","\"Well, I thought it was a good port.\""]
["01:52,340","01:53,340","\"It still played the exact same.\""]
["01:53,340","01:54,980","\"It still played the same, yeah.\""]
["01:54,980","01:55,980","\"It's not bad.\""]
["01:55,980","01:59,660","\"think that that cloud in the background was a platformed out okay because I did\""]
["01:59,660","02:03,500","\"my cousins had it on the SNES\""]
["02:03,500","02:10,540","\"oh okay I got startled there because I thought it was gonna drop me on an\""]
["02:10,540","02:17,900","\"enemy again that's no way do people not call it the snez the snez I call it the snez\""]
["02:17,900","02:24,700","\"when i was a kid i call it the fuck i would probably say snez snez because when i play\""]
["02:24,700","02:29,980","\"Pokemon yellow it said ash is playing the snez and I didn't know what a snez was so I was like 16\""]
["02:29,980","02:33,560","\"So I thought he was like playing a fucking board game or some shit\""]

["02:56,000","03:02,480","\"I don't know like I was hoping that since this is a floating level that maybe no when it's not floating here\""]
["03:02,480","03:07,560","\"This is your way of beating this level is you get lucky with these but then he can zap you out of them\""]
["03:07,560","03:09,480","\"Yeah, so that fucking suck\""]
["03:09,480","03:11,480","\"It's balancing\""]

["03:20,760","03:22,760","\"Wow what a what a hypothetical\""]
["03:22,760","03:25,460","\"Well, I don't know what the alternative is\""]
["03:25,460","03:32,600","\"Something that's just as bad. Well. Yeah, that's the point. Do you rather pour up sulfuric acid on your penis or would you rather die or cry?\""]
["03:32,600","03:35,960","\"Cry I'd rather squeal XD\""]
["03:35,960","03:40,040","\"What if this knee XD was called Disney Squee?\""]

["05:06,880","05:08,960","\"(laughs)\""]
["05:08,960","05:11,440","\"These are good hypotheticals.\""]
["05:12,920","05:13,920","\"We finally figured it out.\""]
["05:13,920","05:14,920","\"We don't know how to do good hyping.\""]
["05:14,920","05:15,920","\"[laughter]\""]

["05:24,120","05:26,120","\"Let's see if we can beat the level by doing this.\""]
["05:26,120","05:27,120","\"If I get bad.\""]
["05:27,120","05:28,120","\"I'll just have to go up, huh?\""]

["05:38,720","05:40,720","\"This game is a piece of duddy.\""]
["05:40,720","05:41,720","\"Doody.\""]
["05:41,720","05:42,720","\"Doody.\""]
["05:42,720","05:45,520","\"The gamers have pissed off the day.\""]
["05:45,520","05:49,120","\"This game is breaking for shit in my face.\""]
["05:49,120","05:54,560","\"I'd rather eat the rotten asshole of the road's kill skunk.\""]
["05:54,560","05:56,720","\"I like the beer.\""]
["05:56,720","06:01,520","\"My favorite thing to do is drink a nice cup of tea.\""]
["06:01,520","06:04,120","\"Why are the clouds blown up and down?\""]

["06:18,360","06:21,480","\"Did you just say stinky American?\""]
["06:21,480","06:22,360","\"I can't say that.\""]
["06:22,360","06:26,600","\"Like the way you fucking erase people from existence.\""]
["06:26,600","06:27,400","\"I do.\""]
["06:27,400","06:30,520","\"Sometimes I wish you'd come into my bedroom and erase me from existence.\""]
["06:30,520","06:36,440","\"Chris, what would you do if Wildwoody came into your room and erased your penis off of you?\""]
["06:36,440","06:38,040","\"So it was just blank instead.\""]
["06:38,040","06:40,920","\"Was the skin is covering the hole where it used to be?\""]

["06:45,420","06:47,600","\"Well, then he screams in your face and says I'm\""]
["06:47,600","06:50,120","\"What I\""]
["06:50,120","06:52,600","\"Would be like you've ruined my life\""]
["06:52,600","06:55,880","\"Now how will I finger myself?\""]
["06:55,880","07:05,320","\"What I didn't know where the platforms are you gonna beat this piece of shit wild woody's a hard game\""]
["07:05,320","07:09,040","\"It's a hard day. That's a hard day's night\""]
["07:09,040","07:11,040","\"I\""]
["07:11,040","07:15,560","\"Baby, why don't you drive my car?\""]
["07:15,560","07:22,560","\"That's a really frustrating looking of course of this because the letters are holy shit\""]
["07:22,560","07:28,720","\"Look at this. How did they expect? Oh my god by you getting accustomed to broken controls\""]
["07:28,720","07:35,520","\"Which good thing I am. Oh, I almost fell through it. That was terrifying. This game looks just like a cowboy\""]
["07:36,160","07:40,960","\"Why do you keep saying that cuz those floating turds in the background? I don't think you're supposed to jump I\""]
["07:40,960","07:44,940","\"Don't know where your speed I need a drawing of a paper plane is what I need\""]

["07:48,360","07:51,660","\"We're always at a check we're all gonna die at some point\""]
["07:51,660","08:00,480","\"Okay, there's a one up I think there should be a fighting game where you don't have a bit stability frames\""]
["08:00,480","08:04,920","\"That's a pretty cool idea who yeah, I'm pretty that was the exit. Yeah\""]
["08:04,920","08:05,760","\"- Hey.\""]
["08:05,760","08:08,420","\"- Hey, there's a hot day.\""]

["08:15,380","08:18,080","\"I love the little lightning bolts.\""]
["08:18,080","08:19,560","\"This cartoon, little lightning bolts.\""]
["08:19,560","08:22,380","\"- So by the way, he was supposed to erase that,\""]
["08:22,380","08:24,340","\"but he decided not to.\""]
["08:24,340","08:25,460","\"- I love those little lightning bolts\""]
["08:25,460","08:27,860","\"coming out of the realistic guys.\""]
["08:27,860","08:29,700","\"- Also, is that what you would shoot, Chris?\""]
["08:29,700","08:30,540","\"- Wish.\""]
["08:30,540","08:33,220","\"- This is not the proper boss fight music for this boss.\""]
["08:33,220","08:35,940","\"There's an unused song on the game disc.\""]
["08:35,940","08:36,860","\"Did they know where I met him?\""]
["08:36,860","08:37,360","\"Yes.\""]
["08:37,360","08:39,300","\"They map the wrong song for his boss fight.\""]
["08:39,300","08:41,300","\"So this song is used twice in the game.\""]
["08:41,300","08:43,860","\"I don't know how they made that mistake, but they did.\""]
["08:43,860","08:45,660","\"[MUSIC PLAYING]\""]
["08:45,660","08:48,060","\"So this was supposed to be for the alien level, which\""]
["08:48,060","08:50,140","\"is going to be the worst level in the game.\""]
["08:50,140","08:53,340","\"If it's any worse than this, I'm going to be very upset.\""]
["08:53,340","08:55,660","\"I didn't think this game was going to be this bad.\""]
["08:55,660","08:58,100","\"Also, I didn't fall away if you just saw that.\""]
["08:58,100","09:00,500","\"But he's dead.\""]
["09:00,500","09:02,540","\"Do you get to start from here if you lose all your lives?\""]
["09:02,540","09:03,540","\"Oh god.\""]
["09:03,540","09:07,540","\"So you fall through these so I have to keep jumping.\""]
["09:07,540","09:08,540","\"Damn!\""]
["09:08,540","09:09,540","\"It's game fucking needed.\""]
["09:09,540","09:10,540","\"I'm sorry Chris.\""]
["09:10,540","09:11,540","\"You know what?\""]
["09:11,540","09:13,540","\"I'm surprised there even is a save.\""]
["09:13,540","09:14,540","\"I am too.\""]
["09:14,540","09:31,540","\"It's Sega CD though so they probably want to show that off.\""]
["09:31,540","09:37,220","\"If a little pencil man came and started erasing your forehead, Chris, is that what you would do?\""]

["09:57,380","09:59,100","\"You need to feel hot in this game controls.\""]
["09:59,100","10:01,100","\"What is this faggot doing?\""]
["10:01,100","10:07,280","\"You're supposed to love the save file so can he just load the save file that deleted it\""]
["10:07,280","10:16,700","\"What that's not my fault I can't be just do it. Yeah, I've dead hasn't that saved over it\""]
