["02:07,000","02:09,000","\"Our targets, the North Mako reactor.\""]
["02:09,000","02:11,000","\"We'll meet on the bridge in front of it.\""]
["02:11,000","02:15,000","\"I've got my eye on you, Papittrios.\""]
["02:15,000","02:16,000","\"Yeah.\""]

["02:19,000","02:21,000","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["02:21,000","02:24,000","\"Wow, look at the integration of 3D models into a cutscene.\""]

["02:37,000","02:42,000","\"a little bit of help, and there's been working on a lot of music recently.\""]
["02:42,000","02:49,560","\"Some for Jeff and Tom's and Corey's game and we only got a few tracks done but\""]
["02:49,560","02:54,600","\"I like how it sounds so far. Corey even came over and held me with one of them.\""]
["02:54,600","02:57,560","\"Excuse me.\""]
["02:57,560","03:02,400","\"Let's see what else can I talk about?\""]
["03:02,400","03:04,400","\"Yeah!\""]
["03:04,400","03:08,360","\"Got 32 people.\""]
["03:08,360","03:14,320","\"It's just in the corner like a little idiot.\""]
["03:14,320","03:16,760","\"God, I love this opening.\""]
["03:16,760","03:17,760","\"It's so good.\""]
["03:17,760","03:21,600","\"It's like the best opening to a game ever.\""]
["03:21,600","03:26,640","\"Yo, this is your first time in a reactor?\""]
["03:26,640","03:29,200","\"Uh, no.\""]
["03:29,200","03:32,760","\"After all, it did work for Shenory, you know.\""]
["03:32,760","03:35,960","\"The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it every day.\""]
["03:35,960","03:43,260","\"It's the life blood of this planet, but Shinra keeps sucking the blood out with these weird machines.\""]
["03:43,260","03:46,660","\"I'm not here for electric faggot, let's just do it.\""]
["03:46,660","03:49,960","\"Okay, from now on you come with me.\""]
["03:49,960","03:51,560","\"Any steps in here?\""]
["03:51,560","03:59,560","\"Another great track from the soundtrack.\""]
["03:59,560","04:03,560","\"[Music]\""]
["04:03,560","04:07,560","\"Code decipher it. When I was a kid I was like, \"\"Code deck-affeared!\"\"\""]

["04:09,560","04:11,560","\"Because kids are stupid.\""]
["04:11,560","04:15,560","\"[Music]\""]
["04:15,560","04:17,560","\"Thanks, Jess.\""]
["04:17,560","04:20,560","\"So, in this version...\""]
["04:20,560","04:22,560","\"Wait!\""]
["04:22,560","04:23,560","\"[Music]\""]
["04:23,560","04:27,560","\"Cloud's mouth is closed. I remember to be open.\""]

["04:29,000","04:30,840","\"She's like a blow up dog.\""]
["04:30,840","04:39,720","\"I love everything about this game, except for lots of things that are wrong with it.\""]
["04:39,720","04:43,160","\"Little by little the reactors drain out all the life.\""]
["04:43,160","04:45,160","\"Then that'll be that.\""]
["04:45,160","04:46,760","\"I don't care.\""]
["04:46,760","04:49,640","\"Hey.\""]
["04:49,640","04:51,640","\"Planet's dying, Papittrius.\""]
["04:51,640","04:56,920","\"The only thing I care about is finishing this job before the Scurity and Robo-Guard's come.\""]
["04:56,920","04:58,920","\"Why are you on?\""]
["04:58,920","05:03,560","\"Step inside me please. Thank you.\""]
["05:03,560","05:12,120","\"So yeah, I like this game, but I know it is extremely dated.\""]
["05:12,120","05:18,680","\"People don't like the chibi look of the 3D models, but I think they're cool.\""]
["05:18,680","05:23,960","\"I don't know if that's nostalgia, but I really do think they're aesthetically feeling.\""]
["05:23,960","05:28,960","\"This is my favorite song of all time.\""]
["05:28,960","05:31,960","\"It's so good.\""]
["05:31,960","05:38,960","\"Oh, it's so good.\""]
["05:38,960","05:43,960","\"Oh, it's over.\""]
["05:43,960","05:44,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:44,960","05:47,960","\"The backgrounds are all beautiful.\""]
["05:47,960","05:50,960","\"I mean, you can see the textures, pixels and shit.\""]
["05:50,960","05:55,680","\"I don't mean the actual pictures. I mean like if you go down here this floor looks really low\""]
["05:55,680","05:59,200","\"Razz, but it's still cool. It's got a charm to it\""]
["05:59,200","06:10,720","\"I want to fight fucking metal robot orbs on plants with guns\""]
["06:10,720","06:16,080","\"Can just run away, but actually it's not working right now\""]
["06:16,080","06:18,680","\"I'm fighting\""]
["06:18,680","06:20,680","\"My controller is not idle properly\""]
["06:20,680","06:25,680","\"For pictures and black men, the ultimate team\""]
["06:25,680","06:41,680","\"If we keep going at this rate we'll be level for about 7 in no time for pictures\""]
["06:41,680","06:43,680","\"Wait, I mean black man\""]
["06:44,680","06:49,800","\"It's okay in front of a ladder to grab onto it and use the directional button to climb down.\""]
["06:49,800","06:54,360","\"I used to play this game so slipping much as a kid.\""]
["06:54,360","06:59,480","\"It was basically my obsession.\""]
["06:59,480","07:04,120","\"Die, you fuck!\""]
["07:04,120","07:08,120","\"That thing just looks sweet.\""]
["07:08,120","07:09,640","\"It's feet are like...\""]
["07:09,640","07:13,000","\"It's like that thing in a home alone that scares mccollico.\""]
["07:13,000","07:20,000","\"(music)\""]
["07:20,000","07:21,000","\"Picking boy.\""]
["07:21,000","07:27,000","\"Are you here to save?\""]
["07:27,000","07:29,000","\"Down you go.\""]
["07:29,000","07:33,000","\"Down the fover ladder.\""]
["07:33,000","07:34,000","\"Should I say?\""]
["07:34,000","07:39,000","\"I think I should.\""]
["07:39,000","07:41,840","\"Oh my god, this controller is working horribly.\""]
["07:41,840","07:44,260","\"Fuck!\""]

["07:54,340","07:58,180","\"Uh, should I use my potions?\""]
["07:58,180","08:01,080","\"Yeah, probably.\""]
["08:01,080","08:04,520","\"There's a spoken fucking boss coming up.\""]

["08:17,520","08:20,520","\"Don't you not yet?\""]
["08:20,520","08:27,520","\"When we blow this place, ain't gonna be none more than a hunk of junk.\""]
["08:27,520","08:29,520","\"For picturesque, you set the bomb.\""]

["08:32,520","08:35,520","\"Just do it. I gotta watch. Make sure you don't pull enough.\""]
["08:35,520","08:37,520","\"Fine, I'll do it.\""]
["08:37,520","08:40,520","\"Watch out.\""]
