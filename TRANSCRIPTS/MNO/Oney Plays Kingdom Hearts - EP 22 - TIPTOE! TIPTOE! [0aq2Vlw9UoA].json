["03:11,100","03:18,860","\"That means there's a decapitated head that's also implies something additionally on top of yeah\""]
["03:18,860","03:22,540","\"I like his creepy twig hands. He's Olaf\""]
["03:22,540","03:29,920","\"Don't say that. It's like a skinny old man hand. The shovel sticking out is a very strange. Why does he have a man feet over there?\""]

["03:54,180","04:00,340","\"It's like how Jack has to dress like Christmas to go to Christmas land you're doing the same thing\""]
["04:00,340","04:03,760","\"I remember I was actually very disappointed with this world when I played it\""]
["04:03,760","04:11,960","\"Because you weren't been to all the locations you wanted to meet the club that's all I mean in this world. Oh\""]
["04:11,960","04:14,660","\"Yeah\""]
["04:15,620","04:20,020","\"I don't I like the tron level. How come nobody else likes the Tron level? It's boring. I\""]
["04:20,020","04:27,080","\"Think it's just enough to be able to see that art style that's entertaining enough for me to be fair\""]
["04:27,080","04:30,260","\"I never really like Tron or its art\""]
["04:30,260","04:37,100","\"Great people with neon slapped on them. That's what I see Chris Chris if you watch\""]

["04:39,700","04:42,700","\"I don't give to Disney is the first at everything Chris\""]
["04:42,700","04:46,540","\"I dare you to watch it again because I bet you'll be in hysterics the whole time.\""]
["04:46,540","04:47,040","\"Really?\""]
["04:47,040","04:49,740","\"It's really, really awkward for all the scenes.\""]
["04:49,740","04:50,740","\"Okay.\""]
["04:50,740","04:51,900","\"It's fun. I like drama.\""]
["04:51,900","04:55,100","\"I just meant I haven't seen it since I was a little kid and I did not.\""]
["04:55,100","04:57,260","\"Did you watch it again? You may have fun with this.\""]
["04:57,260","04:57,900","\"I am curious.\""]
["04:57,900","05:01,700","\"[music]\""]
["05:01,700","05:03,100","\"There it is. The door.\""]

["05:06,700","05:08,700","\"It's a long story.\""]
["05:08,700","05:11,740","\"It wouldn't be very interesting. I don't think anybody would watch it.\""]
["05:11,740","05:12,220","\"What?\""]
["05:12,220","05:15,220","\"That's what Jack says.\""]
["05:15,220","05:22,220","\"You know they're gonna put every single Disney movie in Kingdom Hearts 3.\""]
["05:22,220","05:24,220","\"You can unlock them all and watch them.\""]
["05:24,220","05:27,220","\"If they really did it, all of them I'd be fine with that.\""]
["05:27,220","05:31,220","\"Even all the live action ones.\""]
["05:31,220","05:34,220","\"They should put recess in the third game.\""]
["05:34,220","05:35,220","\"That's a good idea.\""]
["05:35,220","05:39,220","\"I mean now the Toy Story is in it like it feels weird.\""]
["05:39,220","05:45,660","\"What should happen is that Sora and TJ Detweiler collide with each other and then their sentence of the wrong dimensions\""]
["05:45,660","05:47,820","\"And you have to play as TJ for half of the game. I\""]
["05:47,820","05:50,780","\"Would like that. I like TJ\""]
["05:50,780","05:53,260","\"He's a likable little guy\""]
["05:53,260","05:57,940","\"You'd have to choose which of your two playmates will come with you though\""]
["05:57,940","06:03,060","\"What's your least favorite recess character? I really don't like Mikey or Gus\""]
["06:03,060","06:06,940","\"Gus I can understand\""]
["06:06,940","06:15,520","\"I'm fine with Mikey Vince. I remember they don't know you had a Vince they don't do much with them. Yeah, I forgot about him\""]
["06:15,520","06:22,120","\"I'm trying to think of anybody who is just like I'm interested\""]
["06:22,120","06:27,720","\"I'm mad at Gretchen because her skill set applies to a lot of situations. They never use her in\""]
["06:27,720","06:32,280","\"She's a bit of a wasted character. I don't even like her though\""]
["06:32,280","06:35,700","\"I don't even remember her having any sit you like she never had any\""]
["06:35,700","06:39,660","\"Episodes to herself did she she did I don't remember any\""]
["06:39,660","06:45,560","\"There's one where she tries to be friends with this little girl who was just trying to steal her project the whole time\""]
["06:45,560","06:47,560","\"Oh, that's sad. I remember that\""]
["06:47,560","06:54,680","\"I remember she still acts like a kid like just because she's intelligent doesn't mean she's not still a kid\""]
["06:54,680","06:59,960","\"That's fair. I like characterization like that they did for Dexter. It's fun and we're good\""]
["07:00,600","07:03,700","\"It's true when Chuckie built the mother of life.\""]
["07:03,700","07:05,900","\"- Yeah, but intelligent characters in rubber.\""]
["07:05,900","07:06,980","\"- Who's Stu?\""]
["07:06,980","07:09,780","\"- I would like a king where it's Rugrats World.\""]
["07:09,780","07:10,820","\"- I would too.\""]
["07:10,820","07:11,660","\"- I would love that.\""]
["07:11,660","07:13,140","\"- So they don't be babies.\""]
["07:13,140","07:15,700","\"- Oh no, that's awful.\""]
["07:15,700","07:17,100","\"- With big sweaty feet.\""]
["07:17,100","07:17,940","\"- Yeah, my god.\""]
["07:17,940","07:20,740","\"- So far his head would be like three times larger too.\""]
["07:20,740","07:26,780","\"- So it would have really creepy hair in that world.\""]
["07:26,780","07:28,020","\"- He would it be all wiggly?\""]
["07:28,020","07:28,860","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:28,860","07:29,780","\"- Would it be purple?\""]
["07:29,780","07:32,380","\"It would just be Chuckie's hair but shaped like his.\""]
["07:32,380","07:34,380","\"Like it would have the same texture.\""]
["07:34,380","07:38,180","\"- Would, okay, but here's the problem.\""]
["07:38,180","07:41,540","\"Donald and Goofy, what are they?\""]
["07:41,540","07:42,900","\"- Toys, okay.\""]
["07:42,900","07:43,740","\"- No.\""]
["07:43,740","07:44,740","\"- Or like real animals.\""]
["07:44,740","07:47,700","\"- Yeah, Goofy is a spike recolor.\""]
["07:47,700","07:49,260","\"- And Donald is a dill.\""]
["07:49,260","07:51,740","\"- And Donald is just a human baby with a dud for a head.\""]
["07:51,740","07:52,740","\"- I don't use a dill pickle.\""]
["07:52,740","07:57,500","\"Oh, there's a thing behind, I didn't read this thing.\""]
["07:57,500","07:59,180","\"- There's an episode of Rugrats.\""]
["07:59,180","08:04,860","\"Where dill is pushed off screen by a trench coat character and he's replaced with a new dill\""]
["08:04,860","08:08,100","\"Who happens to look like a trench coat character?\""]
["08:08,100","08:17,620","\"I want to see Sora defeat Drew Pickles\""]

["08:23,060","08:26,120","\"I want to see no, I don't want him to do that. I want him to come in\""]
["08:26,120","08:29,820","\"Drew would have one drew would have like an invisible chameleon like everybody else\""]
["08:29,820","08:33,760","\"Only one part. Oh, you know what two people - no, okay\""]
["08:33,760","08:38,700","\"I was using that as the running joke and others - there's gonna be a third one in Kingdom Hearts 3\""]

["08:46,000","08:51,640","\"Does she fucks everyone okay? I don't\""]
["08:54,200","09:01,480","\"I don't think that's what would happen Chris that actually kind of sucked they uh they make a running joke like Charlotte loves Jonathan or whatever\""]
["09:01,480","09:06,960","\"But then they actually introduced him and he's just like a loser. Yeah, she takes advantage of they should have kept them hidden\""]

["09:12,600","09:18,680","\"Or he was sorry. He was trying to blackmail her. She should have fucked him and made a new angelica\""]
["09:18,680","09:21,480","\"to defeat him with a pure\""]
["09:22,840","09:27,900","\"Alpha, if I create another angelica, I can defeat the evil angelica\""]

["11:44,980","11:45,980","\"Uggy Buggy.\""]
["11:45,980","11:46,980","\"That's a more fitting name.\""]
["11:46,980","11:47,480","\"Uggy.\""]
["11:47,480","11:48,980","\"It makes more sense, right?\""]
["11:48,980","11:49,980","\"Because he's full of bugs.\""]
