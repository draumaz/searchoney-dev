["06:57,440","07:03,180","\"Oh my god, oh, I thought the game fucking broke. Oh my god. Oh my god\""]
["07:03,180","07:06,880","\"Start again\""]
["07:06,880","07:08,880","\"How about that?\""]
["07:08,880","07:10,880","\"I didn't expect it.\""]
["07:10,880","07:12,880","\"What were you expecting? It's a 2D platformer.\""]
["07:12,880","07:13,880","\"You have a checkpoint.\""]
["07:13,880","07:15,880","\"Oh, if you have a checkpoint, I didn't expect that.\""]
["07:15,880","07:17,880","\"I thought it would just be from the beginning.\""]
["07:17,880","07:18,880","\"What are you people expecting?\""]
["07:18,880","07:22,880","\"I thought I always hear how fucking terrible Gex is,\""]
["07:22,880","07:24,880","\"so I thought it was going to be a piece of shit.\""]
["07:24,880","07:25,880","\"Because they're thinking of the sequels.\""]
["07:25,880","07:27,880","\"No one ever played the first one.\""]
["07:27,880","07:30,880","\"The first one was just an all right little 2D platformer.\""]

["07:33,880","07:36,160","\"There none of this is offensive to me. No\""]
["07:36,160","07:40,320","\"Like I said, it's cuz it was on the 3DO first\""]
["07:40,320","07:44,320","\"So it couldn't really be a 3d game yet, then they made it a 3d game and a fucking suck\""]
["07:44,320","07:49,040","\"I guess you know that's probably what it was was that if you weren't 3d at a certain time\""]
["07:49,040","07:54,680","\"You just like got you got absolutely you got sunk. It's slightly unresponsive\""]
["07:54,680","07:58,120","\"Running no, it's because\""]
