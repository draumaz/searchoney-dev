["02:47,480","02:49,360","\"was believable and was a robot,\""]
["02:49,360","02:50,840","\"but something about this now.\""]
["02:50,840","02:52,720","\"- I really like when Crash gets vaporized.\""]
["02:52,720","02:53,560","\"- Me too, it's nice.\""]
["02:53,560","02:55,120","\"- I think it's probably one of the scary.\""]
["02:55,120","02:56,880","\"It's nice, it's peaceful.\""]
["02:56,880","03:00,240","\"How come it's okay for boys to get vaporized but not girl?\""]
["03:00,240","03:07,360","\"There's probably a, there's probably a heck of this where they swapped the model Coco so you can watch her to get vaporized.\""]

["03:28,400","03:29,320","\"- Toki was funny.\""]
["03:29,320","03:30,680","\"- That was too far.\""]
["03:30,680","03:32,000","\"That was I overdid it.\""]
["03:32,000","03:32,840","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:32,840","03:34,160","\"- Food slimes, blemises.\""]
["03:34,160","03:35,720","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:35,720","03:37,720","\"Food slipers.\""]
["03:37,720","03:39,640","\"- That was a really good concept for a show.\""]
["03:39,640","03:40,560","\"- It was.\""]
["03:40,560","03:42,440","\"- It's okay, it's gone forever\""]
["03:42,440","03:44,240","\"and never gets a conclusion.\""]
["03:44,240","03:47,880","\"- Little edgy 16 year old me was in heaven.\""]
["03:47,880","03:49,280","\"- Me too, I loved it.\""]

["03:52,560","03:53,400","\"- I remember it.\""]
["03:53,400","03:54,240","\"- I remember it.\""]
["03:54,240","04:00,240","\"I remember, yeah, I think that's probably true too, but I remember it at the time.\""]
["04:00,240","04:05,240","\"I remember whenever it was actually just trying to be goofy, it actually ended up being very funny.\""]
["04:05,240","04:07,240","\"It has really bad sound mixing in the first season.\""]
["04:07,240","04:11,240","\"You can barely hear what anyone's saying for some reason, especially the first episode.\""]
["04:11,240","04:15,240","\"Are you saying Brendan Small doesn't know nothing about audio?\""]
["04:15,240","04:20,240","\"Um, I would tell you right now, right here, Brendan Small sucks my dick.\""]
["04:21,240","04:24,760","\"You're a lucky man Brendan small come on as a guest and prove him otherwise\""]
["04:24,760","04:30,620","\"Brendan small you're my hero. He wouldn't do it. No, you wouldn't do it. Oh, you know what I like him\""]
["04:30,620","04:35,200","\"He's a good thing. He's really talented. I think Lucy daughter of the devil still holds up\""]
["04:35,200","04:40,840","\"I watched that again recently and I thought it was still good. Am I in it? I thought the drinky crow show still hold up\""]
["04:40,840","04:42,840","\"I died I\""]
["04:42,840","04:45,980","\"Think I think it holds up and I think you died\""]
["04:45,980","04:49,400","\"Red small so good at use\""]
["04:50,920","04:56,140","\"Why do you Chris? Why do you think he was so nervous like that first episode of home movies?\""]
["04:56,140","04:58,300","\"Yeah, it's fucking terrible. Is it?\""]
["04:58,300","05:04,160","\"Well a lot a lot of a lot of people are gonna disagree with you on that because the whole thing was improvised\""]
["05:04,160","05:10,520","\"But the first few episodes of home movies he he's tripping over himself trying to talk without laughing\""]
["05:10,520","05:15,260","\"He sounds really panicked the whole time. That sounds funny and then as soon as the second season came in\""]
["05:15,260","05:18,860","\"He was completely fine when doing it. Do you think it's just because they depended on scripts more?\""]
["05:20,000","05:26,180","\"Second season of uh, though a lot of it's still improv improv, but there is more structure to it\""]
["05:26,180","05:32,100","\"Fourth season. I think is when they completely gave up on any improv Jesus\""]
["05:32,100","05:38,580","\"This is fucking scary young man is and oh, oh, what would you say is the best episode of home movies the one where?\""]
["05:38,580","05:44,800","\"Where fucking coach McGurk kills Bren what he jerks the girl\""]
["05:49,400","05:52,480","\"He says, I can't do his voice.\""]
["05:52,480","05:53,320","\"- Bread day.\""]
["05:53,320","05:54,160","\"- Bread day.\""]
["05:54,160","05:55,000","\"- Bread day.\""]
["05:55,000","05:57,080","\"- Give my gherkin a jerkkin.\""]
["05:57,080","05:57,920","\"- You're the bad guy.\""]
["05:57,920","06:02,400","\"- I like whatever Coach McGurk yells at Melissa\""]
["06:02,400","06:04,400","\"for being a little girl.\""]
["06:04,400","06:07,200","\"He gets really abusive with her and it's really funny.\""]
["06:07,200","06:10,440","\"- He's got a really funny yelling voice in general.\""]
["06:10,440","06:12,160","\"- She's really good at acting like a child.\""]
["06:12,160","06:13,000","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:13,000","06:15,240","\"- Who is she?\""]
["06:15,240","06:16,080","\"Is she my girl?\""]
["06:16,080","06:17,160","\"- Her name is actually Melissa, right?\""]
["06:17,160","06:18,000","\"- Really?\""]
["06:18,000","06:18,840","\"- Yeah.\""]

["08:00,360","08:06,040","\"You don't like that one. There's really no I like that one story to it besides the fact that it's backwards\""]
["08:06,040","08:11,040","\"Well, I feel like that Renaissance fair one. I really don't like you. It's just because you don't like the concept of no\""]

["08:28,400","08:29,560","\"I shouldn't have said the worst one,\""]

["08:30,680","08:31,840","\"Yeah, what is it?\""]
["08:31,840","08:33,280","\"It's the fourth season.\""]

["08:38,680","08:39,520","\"I don't remember that.\""]
["08:39,520","08:40,600","\"And it's really, really boring.\""]
["08:40,600","08:46,520","\"It's mostly pre-scripted, so it's not even entertaining. I got really mad when they made Walter and Perry steel stuff\""]
["08:46,520","08:55,400","\"Cuz it's it's it's subverting expectations when you do that when the the characters who seem like they're the\""]
