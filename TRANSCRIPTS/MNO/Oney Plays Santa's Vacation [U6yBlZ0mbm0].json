["05:36,000","05:39,760","\"I'd dangle my beard down the chimney killing myself\""]
["05:39,760","05:42,520","\"Why would that kill you?\""]
["05:42,600","05:49,080","\"Yeah, the fire would slowly travel up his beard like a like a wick and Rudolph would stand on my back forcing me to stay there\""]

["06:26,840","06:28,600","\"- When Santa dies, he gets turned to stone.\""]
["06:28,600","06:29,840","\"- Then as a catch of Wake's Up,\""]
