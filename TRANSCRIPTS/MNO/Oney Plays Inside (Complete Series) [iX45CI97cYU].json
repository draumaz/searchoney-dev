["01:21,780","01:23,960","\"Now, but this game's pretty neat,\""]
["01:23,960","01:29,180","\"So just because it's a little bit like open to interpretation, but it gives you very clear\""]
["01:29,180","01:32,660","\"like there are very clear events that happen in the game.\""]
["01:32,660","01:36,720","\"So there's a lot of different ways you can piece together the story, but there's definite\""]
["01:36,720","01:41,720","\"things that definitely happen that you can choose to connect or not connect.\""]

["44:20,120","44:21,180","\"How do they do that?\""]
["44:21,180","44:24,780","\"They eat enough and then they sleep for three months, but they wake up\""]
["44:24,780","44:28,540","\"Intermentally and they do a little bit of hunting. Do they?\""]
["44:28,540","44:35,600","\"I thought that they just the way that they slept it was just super like low calorie intensive so that\""]

["44:39,220","44:41,740","\"You know like PlayStation rest mode. Yeah, and they just kind of go\""]

["45:11,380","45:16,440","\"Like most people wouldn't but some people would. I mean yeah, like if you were raised to survive\""]
["45:16,440","45:23,280","\"You could probably learn survival by by probably maybe like 12 or 10 if you're a fast learner\""]
["45:23,280","45:31,360","\"You know what animals are genuinely like fucking awful for survival or dogs. Well, they're domesticated right\""]
["45:31,360","45:37,000","\"So us humans made them fucking stupid. Yeah, they can't do shit\""]
["45:37,000","45:42,600","\"They'll chew through wires and they'll jump into pools and drown and they'll fucking run out on the street and get run over\""]
