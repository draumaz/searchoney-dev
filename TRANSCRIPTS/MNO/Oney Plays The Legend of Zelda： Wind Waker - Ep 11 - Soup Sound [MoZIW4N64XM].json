["12:24,400","12:26,640","\"and you have to be the best place to do it\""]
["12:26,640","12:29,760","\"is on the island we were on before\""]

["12:54,000","12:55,480","\"- Chum-a-ly.\""]
["12:55,480","12:59,240","\"- And it's something like when you're turning back and forth\""]
["12:59,240","13:04,400","\"You keep pausing the game and turning, then your numbers in the game dip in a negative\""]
["13:04,400","13:08,040","\"so Link picks up speed almost like a fucking 12 hour morning.\""]
["13:08,040","13:10,160","\"Yeah, if you put it in the opposite direction, so you have to press, you have to hold the\""]

["13:13,760","13:17,320","\"Yeah, you do that for like five minutes straight, you just pause and repeat and turn around\""]
["13:17,320","13:20,160","\"and it's really hard, you know, you have to throw to do it, but then Link will shoot\""]
["13:20,160","13:21,800","\"across the entire ocean.\""]
["13:21,800","13:27,360","\"You'll go so fast that you'll actually glitch through sequences and skip like loading zones\""]

["13:35,640","13:36,480","\"It's awesome.\""]
["13:36,480","13:39,680","\"- In this game, yeah, I mean, I watch,\""]
["13:39,680","13:42,840","\"I've always kinda wanted to talk about this discussion\""]
["13:42,840","13:45,280","\"and just talking about speed runs in general.\""]
["13:45,280","13:47,800","\"I love watching speed runs.\""]
["13:47,800","13:50,720","\"- I like watching them when they're not seven hours long.\""]
["13:50,720","13:52,080","\"- Yeah, I agree.\""]
["13:52,080","13:53,280","\"- I know where speed runs are, like two hours,\""]
["13:53,280","13:54,560","\"speed runs are perfect.\""]
["13:54,560","13:55,720","\"- I'm kinda different.\""]
["13:55,720","14:00,520","\"I don't mind watching them, but when I watch someone do 100% speed run and they're doing\""]
["14:00,520","14:04,240","\"like total optimization, that's like fascinating to me.\""]
["14:04,240","14:05,720","\"But it depends on the game.\""]
["14:05,720","14:10,200","\"I do understand watching a seven hour speed run can be really annoying, but I've watched\""]
["14:10,200","14:13,440","\"so many speed runs that Barry and like, and then there's different types of speed runs\""]
["14:13,440","14:18,080","\"because like with my 64, there's extended categories.\""]
["14:18,080","14:24,880","\"Yeah, but then there's also like getting you 100 unique mushrooms or 99 unique mushrooms\""]
["14:24,880","14:30,900","\"or 99 unique mushrooms getting 99 unique lives, so it's not the same one up every time they get 99 different ones and then there's\""]
["14:30,900","14:35,240","\"beating the game without using a cannon collecting a coin and\""]
["14:35,240","14:42,360","\"You not collecting any caps and it's like really interesting shit like I learned the true nature of who you are when you actually\""]
["14:42,360","14:46,620","\"Finished watching the entirety of like the 26 hour castle craft\""]
["14:46,620","14:50,060","\"I didn't captain\""]
["14:50,060","14:54,280","\"Nicholas I forget his name, but he he speed ran\""]

["15:04,080","15:05,280","\"He does obviously.\""]
["15:05,280","15:08,480","\"It's because like you missed one run. It's the same fucking thing.\""]
["15:08,480","15:12,280","\"Exactly. Do the exact same thing over and over again. Just to unlock all the characters.\""]
