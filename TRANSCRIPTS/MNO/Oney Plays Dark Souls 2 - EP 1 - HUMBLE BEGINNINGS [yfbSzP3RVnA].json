["08:08,760","08:11,760","\"Uh, can't use anything yet, jeez.\""]
["08:11,760","08:14,760","\"Maybe I can use it if I double-hand it.\""]
["08:14,760","08:17,460","\"Who knows?\""]
["08:17,460","08:19,860","\"It's like the Drake Sword, I guess, huh?\""]

["08:27,060","08:28,760","\"Put that shit away.\""]
["08:28,760","08:29,760","\"Scrotor.\""]
["08:29,760","08:32,560","\"Damn, to go exploring!\""]
["08:32,560","08:34,760","\"I'm gonna skip all this...\""]
["08:34,760","08:36,260","\"all this shit.\""]
["08:37,460","08:39,460","\"We can't go down there yet.\""]
["08:39,460","08:41,460","\"Scrotol has no power.\""]
["08:41,460","08:46,460","\"We must go and explore so we can find power.\""]
["08:46,460","08:49,460","\"La la la la la la!\""]
["08:49,460","08:50,460","\"Jolly Gold!\""]
["08:50,460","08:52,460","\"Yes.\""]
["08:52,460","08:55,460","\"Read message, what the fuck?\""]
["08:55,460","08:57,460","\"Are you ready?\""]
["08:57,460","08:59,460","\"By the way, praise the sun!\""]
["08:59,460","09:01,460","\"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\""]
["09:01,460","09:02,460","\"Ahh.\""]
["09:02,460","09:03,460","\"Dang.\""]
["09:04,460","09:06,460","\"Hooray for illusionary wall!\""]
["09:06,460","09:09,060","\"Let me guess, there is none. Yeah.\""]
["09:09,060","09:12,460","\"I don't know why, in Dark Souls 1 you never see fake messages.\""]
["09:12,460","09:15,860","\"Like, you do, but like, they're so fucking rare.\""]
["09:15,860","09:18,060","\"But in this, they're everywhere!\""]
["09:18,060","09:21,160","\"Everyone's a dick in this one.\""]
["09:21,160","09:24,160","\"I think it's because the first game wasn't really that popular.\""]
["09:24,160","09:28,460","\"And then, for some reason, everyone went abeshit over the second one, even though it's a worse game.\""]
["09:28,460","09:30,960","\"But that means that all the little kids are playing this game.\""]
["09:30,960","09:34,360","\"So that's why there's so many bullshit messages.\""]
["09:34,360","09:36,360","\"Uh, yeah!\""]
["09:36,360","09:41,360","\"One thing I do like more in this game is the jumping. They put it on the L3 click.\""]
["09:41,360","09:46,360","\"So, it's not as bad. I mean, I think it's good. I don't have a problem with it.\""]
["09:46,360","09:50,360","\"Some people do though, some people hate it. I disagree, I think it's good.\""]
["09:50,360","09:55,360","\"Welcome to Majula, Ablam Gata.\""]
["09:55,360","09:59,360","\"Hooray.\""]
["09:59,360","10:05,680","\"Okay, I gotta say this place is really nice to look at\""]
["10:05,680","10:09,600","\"Yes, I agree shut up screw-tor\""]
["10:09,600","10:14,400","\"This is the most annoying bitch in any game ever\""]
["10:14,400","10:27,600","\"Hurry up\""]
["10:28,440","10:31,280","\"You may level up by the power of the Emerald Herald\""]
["10:31,280","10:36,200","\"Yeah\""]
["10:36,200","10:39,240","\"That's really fucking annoying I have to listen to that every single time\""]
["10:39,240","10:43,380","\"I want to level up unlike Dark Souls where you can just sit down at a bonfire and level up\""]
["10:43,380","10:47,240","\"What the fuck were they thinking no like seriously?\""]
["10:47,240","10:51,920","\"That is the most ridiculous decision I've ever seen\""]
["10:51,920","10:55,040","\"Demon souls\""]
["10:55,040","10:58,480","\"Wasn't annoying that it wasn't that bad to go back and level up because\""]
["10:58,480","11:05,400","\"You can go back to the Nexus and you can just like talk to her and she she says her shit while you're leveling up\""]
["11:05,400","11:06,560","\"So it's not as bad\""]
["11:06,560","11:10,960","\"But then they fixed it in Dark Souls and it just made you level up whenever you wanted that a bonfire and that's fair\""]
["11:10,960","11:13,960","\"And then they got rid of it for literally no reason what the fuck\""]
["11:13,960","11:18,000","\"Yeah, you were in the last game\""]
["11:18,000","11:21,400","\"Well this guy's talking to\""]
["11:22,120","11:24,120","\"What is this?\""]
["11:24,120","11:25,120","\"What is this?\""]
["11:25,120","11:27,120","\"Don't give up. Thanks.\""]
["11:27,120","11:29,120","\"I won't.\""]
["11:29,120","11:33,120","\"Okay, uh, I gotta go to the forest of the fallen giants.\""]
["11:33,120","11:35,120","\"Or some shit like that.\""]
["11:35,120","11:37,120","\"Hey, yay!\""]
["11:37,120","11:42,120","\"What way is that again? I don't think it's down there.\""]
["11:42,120","11:44,120","\"Or is it? I forget.\""]
["11:44,120","11:46,120","\"I didn't get that far in this.\""]
["11:46,120","11:50,120","\"To be frank, I lost interest.\""]
["11:51,120","11:53,120","\"Maybe I'll beat it this time\""]
["11:53,120","11:58,000","\"Thank you hooray\""]
["11:58,000","12:01,840","\"Raaah\""]
["12:01,840","12:08,680","\"Yes, this will be a good adventure for Scrotal\""]
["12:08,680","12:13,280","\"Hmm I think this is the right way\""]
["12:13,280","12:17,600","\"In fact, I know this is the right way\""]
["12:19,080","12:21,080","\"Yeah\""]
["12:21,080","12:26,600","\"Jeez actually, I don't think this is the right way\""]
["12:26,600","12:30,760","\"This don't seem right is it was in this\""]
["12:30,760","12:41,880","\"The crimson parama great just what I always wanted puppy water\""]
["12:46,200","12:48,200","\"What the hell?\""]
["12:48,200","12:50,600","\"Scrotour, what have you done? Where the fuck are we?\""]
["12:50,600","12:57,920","\"Leave her ahead, thanks\""]
["12:57,920","13:02,560","\"Hooray\""]
["13:02,560","13:05,640","\"Hmm ah what the fuck\""]
["13:05,640","13:10,160","\"Why does this game look worse than the first one too like\""]
["13:10,160","13:15,040","\"It does it looks worse. It's a sequel and it looks worse\""]
["13:15,040","13:19,620","\"Look, I'm not one that's, I'm not crazy about graphics.\""]
["13:19,620","13:21,340","\"Dark Souls 1 barely looks great.\""]
["13:21,340","13:23,280","\"It doesn't even look that good.\""]
["13:23,280","13:27,120","\"It looks fine, but it's definitely not one of the better graphic games.\""]
["13:27,120","13:30,400","\"But what I'm saying is, this should have improved.\""]
["13:30,400","13:32,400","\"It's a sequel.\""]
["13:32,400","13:33,400","\"Despair.\""]
["13:33,400","13:34,400","\"Oh man.\""]
["13:34,400","13:40,840","\"I was not supposed to go this way.\""]
["13:40,840","13:44,040","\"Ah yes, the tower to flame.\""]
["13:44,040","13:47,300","\"Well, at least I can warp.\""]
