["01:00,720","01:01,720","\"But he's a Bobcat.\""]
["01:01,720","01:03,720","\"They live in the wild where there is no yarn.\""]
["01:03,720","01:04,320","\"I know.\""]
["01:04,320","01:05,920","\"And they're yarn for yarn.\""]
["01:05,920","01:07,520","\"They yearn for yarn.\""]

["01:11,520","01:12,220","\"Like a cat.\""]

["01:13,220","01:14,420","\"But there's no fall damage.\""]
["01:14,420","01:15,420","\"They fixed that problem.\""]
