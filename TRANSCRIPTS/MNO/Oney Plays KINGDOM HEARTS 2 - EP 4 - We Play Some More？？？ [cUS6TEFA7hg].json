["04:35,740","04:55,580","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["04:55,580","04:59,580","\"It's weirding me out to play this game with such a high frame rate.\""]
["04:59,580","05:01,820","\"I'm not used to seeing everything move that smoothly.\""]
["05:01,820","05:04,020","\"This is what usually run at three frames a second.\""]

["05:05,020","05:08,320","\"I didn't even notice ding dong was the one to point it out at the time\""]
["05:08,320","05:13,540","\"It is right. It's really weird going back playing games you play when you're younger and they all run at like 15 frames a second\""]
["05:13,540","05:19,340","\"But you didn't notice when you're younger. Yeah, like what is the human eye when you're an infant or stupid?\""]
["05:19,340","05:21,500","\"Can only see 20 frames per second\""]
["05:21,500","05:29,340","\"Or a dumb dumb why 20 frames specifically because I heard it somewhere. I don't know that skybox was pretty\""]

["05:49,500","05:55,580","\"That's not what you're supposed to do when you find a body in a bag. Okay, you jump on it. Did you ever go to Disneyland?\""]
["05:55,580","05:58,240","\"This is an attraction there the Roxas bag writer\""]

["06:27,160","06:28,480","\"Is it just full of air now?\""]

["06:43,200","06:44,560","\"this doesn't impact anything.\""]
["06:44,560","06:46,840","\"- Is there actually seven wonders in this little town?\""]
["06:46,840","06:49,560","\"- You have to find a bunch of mysterious things.\""]
["06:49,560","06:50,720","\"- Is that child one of them?\""]
["06:50,720","06:52,760","\"- And then at the end of each cutscene,\""]

["07:06,280","07:07,400","\"That's true.\""]
["07:07,400","07:09,360","\"That could be their name.\""]
["07:09,360","07:11,960","\"That looks like a guy called Gary Greenshirt.\""]
["07:11,960","07:14,040","\"Looks iffy in there.\""]

["07:37,340","07:39,740","\"You get to dance with them, that's the mini game.\""]
["07:39,740","07:42,140","\"Chris, it was a simpler time for video games.\""]
["07:42,140","07:43,240","\"I guess you're right.\""]
["07:43,240","07:44,940","\"Did you-\""]
["07:44,940","07:49,140","\"Did you ever just pop on simple and clean and start dancing to your TV screen?\""]
["07:49,140","07:52,040","\"I think I told you before that one time I went over to my friend's house\""]
["07:52,040","07:54,040","\"He was a huge huge huge person\""]
["07:54,040","07:57,640","\"And I just went over to his house. I think I say like huge fans\""]
["07:57,640","08:01,640","\"That person so I know he was a monolith of a human being\""]
["08:01,640","08:03,400","\"I just pictured him being like morbidly obese\""]
["08:03,400","08:08,560","\"And he was telling me about like cool games like Silent Hill 4 and we just he put on simple and clean\""]
["08:08,560","08:11,240","\"I'm just sat there and listen to it was really awkward\""]
["08:11,240","08:16,320","\"That is a weird what he wants you to say. That is a weird turn of events. I would not have expected\""]
["08:16,320","08:19,880","\"Just put it on like oh, yeah, this is cool. I would not have expected that after\""]
["08:20,720","08:25,920","\"It's Island Hill for talk. Yeah, I know what did you do? I'm a cold by mom\""]
["08:25,920","08:30,640","\"Can you please pick me up\""]
["08:30,640","08:34,360","\"And she said she planned it all from the beginning\""]
["08:34,360","08:39,700","\"It was all her doing she wanted you to hear that song she wanted me to turn into a freak\""]
["08:39,700","08:42,220","\"She thought it was a cool song\""]
["08:42,220","08:47,800","\"What would you do Chris if you found out that your mom was actually like a hyper fan of Kingdom Hearts?\""]
["08:48,120","08:51,920","\"That would be deeply deeply disturbing\""]
["08:51,920","08:57,120","\"Because she doesn't seem like that kind of a person her favorite her favorite care kind of a crazy Chris\""]
["08:57,120","09:03,660","\"What kind of person she's just like she just works in it in a shop all day. She doesn't play them\""]
["09:03,660","09:06,920","\"Yeah, who who do you think is the right kind of person for Kingdom Hearts?\""]
["09:06,920","09:17,240","\"Because what why do you like it would you have expected yeah, okay because you are a gay\""]
["09:17,240","09:19,240","\"furry\""]
["09:19,240","09:24,420","\"fair enough I like that makes sense I like you to hurts I'm not a gay furry\""]
["09:24,420","09:28,720","\"Everyone likes you to burn I don't think you like it on the same look\""]
["09:28,720","09:33,820","\"I'm just saying it my mom wouldn't like it that's all lots of people like it you're not a true fan Chris\""]
["09:33,820","09:40,680","\"I am oh fuck I would say that a gay furry would be more likely to liking him hearts than a not gay furry fucking Christ\""]
["09:41,240","09:43,240","\"You're getting the wall's roll hard.\""]
["09:43,240","09:47,240","\"Why are we just talking about furries liking Kingdom Hearts stuff?\""]
["09:47,240","09:48,240","\"I don't know.\""]
["09:48,240","09:49,240","\"It has nothing to do with furries.\""]
