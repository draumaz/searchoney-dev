["06:30,800","06:34,980","\"Yeah, they got I mean they have their own gimmick, but it's like they're largely using it as a template\""]
["06:34,980","06:42,180","\"I like I'm not saying it's a bad thing necessarily. It's just seems pretty. Oh it is pretty really like linear platforms are really fun\""]

["07:33,540","07:40,460","\"Like grab it. There you go. Okay. Wobob wob. Do a bound. Oh, this would be actually really fun to speedrun one more\""]
["07:40,460","07:46,420","\"Probably would be because you have a run button too, and it's really dangerous to use. Yeah, so if you're good at it\""]
["07:46,420","07:51,880","\"Okay, but those up. Hey, there's a rocket\""]

["08:32,180","08:35,640","\"It's bullshit. No, there's like a little bit of a delay when you're running in a jump\""]
["08:35,640","08:40,060","\"If you throw it at that little floating box though by walking over there\""]
["08:40,060","08:46,520","\"You could jump and throw it from the left side. Yeah like that. Just jump. It seems like you could just throw it\""]
