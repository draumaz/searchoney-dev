["02:56,440","03:04,520","\"Because you keep repeating yourself and also the key says those who hold this are doomed to repeat themselves or some shit like that's completely fair. Mm-hmm. Ah\""]
["03:04,520","03:14,680","\"That was very good. I was ringing my door though. Who's ringing your door bowl? It's Elene. Eileen. Come on, I leaned.\""]
