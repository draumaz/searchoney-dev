["00:03,400","00:04,400","\"[DING]\""]
["00:04,400","00:06,400","\"With friends.\""]
["00:06,400","00:08,000","\"Why do you hate Santa?\""]
["00:08,000","00:10,400","\"Look at how his beard is moving.\""]
["00:10,400","00:12,520","\"It's just one solid plank.\""]
["00:12,520","00:16,000","\"Maybe they should have rigged his beard with a bone or two.\""]
["00:16,000","00:18,000","\"I think this game is rigged.\""]
["00:18,000","00:20,680","\"It was rigged from the beginning.\""]
["00:20,680","00:22,600","\"Hey, Donald in this world.\""]
["00:22,600","00:23,400","\"Why?\""]
["00:23,400","00:24,400","\"He's scary.\""]
["00:24,400","00:25,400","\"That's cool.\""]
["00:25,400","00:26,200","\"That's fine.\""]
["00:26,200","00:26,900","\"Let him be scary.\""]
["00:26,900","00:28,200","\"I want to kick him in the small pieces.\""]
["00:28,200","00:30,200","\"Christmas is scary, all kinds of crazy.\""]
["00:30,200","00:31,900","\"Why you want to beat up every king of hearts character?\""]
["00:31,900","00:33,300","\"Oh, they're crazy, unnatural.\""]
["00:33,300","00:35,300","\"What was your ass left?\""]
["00:35,300","00:38,200","\"Why do you want to beat up the most annoying things possible?\""]
["00:38,200","00:39,200","\"Just before we came over.\""]
["00:39,200","00:40,200","\"We came over.\""]
["00:40,200","00:42,000","\"Let's start this over though.\""]
["00:42,000","00:48,200","\"We watched an animated film earlier and it was called \"\"Gimmele Bells\"\" featuring Jason Alexander as a singing elf.\""]
["00:48,200","00:49,200","\"Oh.\""]
["00:49,200","00:55,200","\"And he tells us a story about how you should sometimes think with your heart instead of your brain,\""]
["00:55,200","00:58,320","\"especially around Christmas time, because around Christmas time,\""]
["00:58,320","00:59,920","\"it might get you into trouble.\""]
["00:59,920","01:03,520","\"So this dad cannot afford presents for his kids.\""]
["01:03,520","01:07,120","\"His bright idea is he's going to go sell his horse\""]
["01:07,120","01:11,480","\"to buy a toy horse to give his kids for Christmas.\""]
["01:11,480","01:12,840","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:12,840","01:14,720","\"- And so the kids are very sad, they cry.\""]
["01:14,720","01:16,560","\"- They cry because their friend has been sold.\""]
["01:16,560","01:18,480","\"- Their friend has been sold, but it's okay.\""]
["01:18,480","01:21,800","\"He got them a replacement friend that doesn't,\""]
["01:21,800","01:23,960","\"you know, think or act or anything.\""]
["01:23,960","01:24,840","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:24,840","01:27,920","\"to cruelly remind them that he just sold their friend.\""]
["01:27,920","01:30,080","\"And then he's confused why they're unhappy.\""]
["01:30,080","01:36,960","\"Then the toy horse explodes with a blue aura\""]
["01:36,960","01:38,880","\"and turns into a real horse.\""]
["01:38,880","01:41,120","\"And the male fly away into the moon.\""]
["01:41,120","01:41,960","\"(laughing)\""]
["01:41,960","01:42,800","\"- They do, it's true.\""]
["01:42,800","01:43,640","\"- It's true, this is true.\""]
["01:43,640","01:46,120","\"This is from Family Home Entertainment.\""]
["01:46,120","01:47,700","\"- You explained that, like that,\""]
["01:47,700","01:49,600","\"did you ever hear that lion in Destiny?\""]
["01:49,600","01:50,440","\"- Why?\""]
["01:50,440","01:52,160","\"- Like that wizard came from the moon.\""]
["01:52,160","01:53,320","\"(laughing)\""]
["01:53,320","01:54,160","\"Did you hear that?\""]
["01:54,160","02:00,360","\"scattered sprinkles on everybody. They got a really famous and good actor who\""]
["02:00,360","02:05,200","\"wasn't good at voice acting though. They sounded ridiculous. I remember that the\""]
["02:05,200","02:08,600","\"people were criticizing the fact that they got talented people but didn't\""]
["02:08,600","02:13,840","\"give them any direction. I mean acting and voice acting aren't the same thing.\""]
["02:13,840","02:18,880","\"Well I remember too when we when we were going to E3 we ended up with an\""]
["02:18,880","02:22,200","\"Uber driver who was a voice actress and she was telling us about how like yeah\""]
["02:22,200","02:26,120","\"Sometimes when I go in for these gigs, they don't give you any instruction\""]
["02:26,120","02:29,480","\"They just show you a video and they just tell you to read the lines and then you go in and out\""]
["02:29,480","02:35,680","\"So it's probably just a situation like that. I'd imagine I've heard that a big like actors like Morgan Freeman\""]
["02:35,680","02:39,800","\"They're like I don't I do my thing in one tape. You don't listen to me\""]
["02:39,800","02:41,960","\"It's like Christy the clown they come in and out\""]
["02:41,960","02:44,200","\"Yeah, no, they do I like that bit\""]
["02:44,200","02:49,280","\"They come in and out and they do their thing and that they do such a shitty job most of the time that they get\""]
["02:49,680","02:52,480","\"and impersonators to come in and fix the lines.\""]
["02:52,480","02:54,760","\"- Oh, but then the impersonators aren't good either,\""]
["02:54,760","02:56,120","\"so they get impersonators.\""]
["02:56,120","02:58,280","\"- They get impersonators, yeah.\""]
["02:58,280","03:00,280","\"- Did I ever tell you that when I was younger,\""]
["03:00,280","03:02,480","\"when I was very young, I watched the show on TV.\""]
["03:02,480","03:05,960","\"I think it was called the true story of,\""]
["03:05,960","03:08,600","\"and they would get nursery rhymes and shit\""]
["03:08,600","03:11,880","\"and try to make them epic with an overblown story.\""]
["03:11,880","03:15,200","\"So it'd be like the true story of Humpty Dumpty.\""]
["03:15,200","03:17,200","\"And it'd be like Humpty Dumpty's up on his wall\""]
["03:17,200","03:18,120","\"and he'll fall down.\""]
["03:18,120","03:21,800","\"But then, it'll go into like the story of what happened after he fell down\""]
["03:21,800","03:24,560","\"or he's just like walking around the city and everyone's being mean to him and shit.\""]
["03:24,560","03:25,560","\"Oh no.\""]
["03:25,560","03:29,720","\"And then at the end of it, he becomes king or some bullshit, I don't know.\""]
["03:29,720","03:30,800","\"But he's dead.\""]
["03:30,800","03:32,560","\"He fell apart.\""]
["03:32,560","03:34,360","\"Oh my God, these guys look so cool.\""]
["03:34,360","03:35,800","\"I would hate to be Humpty Dumpty.\""]
["03:35,800","03:37,040","\"He's an egg human.\""]
["03:37,040","03:39,000","\"Originally, he was just a human.\""]
["03:39,000","03:39,560","\"It's true.\""]
["03:39,560","03:40,080","\"Really?\""]
["03:40,080","03:41,520","\"Yeah, he wasn't an egg to begin with.\""]
["03:41,520","03:44,920","\"They, they, they just started illustrating him that way and again, it's stuck.\""]
["03:44,920","03:46,000","\"Really?\""]
["03:46,000","03:46,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:46,360","03:51,500","\"Originally I was supposed to just be a fat egg like individual. Dr. Eggman. That was his name\""]
["03:51,500","03:56,660","\"I want to say that the Alice in Wonderland that was oh my god. Look at how I'm sorry\""]
["03:56,660","04:01,880","\"I'm almost dying. He looks really cool with this color scheme. I'm sorry for what I look at the that's scary\""]
["04:01,880","04:04,940","\"Whoa, this is like you going he stabs you\""]
["04:04,940","04:09,500","\"He's stabbing a little child happy Halloween Chris in Japan\""]
["04:11,840","04:17,560","\"How do you know it's Japan just mentioning that it becomes a hate crime you think he's from America really he could be\""]
["04:17,560","04:19,720","\"He's a Halloween this American\""]
["04:19,720","04:21,680","\"Sora\""]
["04:21,680","04:27,580","\"So no, no, sorry, sorry Japanese. He's very clearly do they say he's Japanese at a point in this\""]
["04:27,580","04:32,780","\"No, but they illustrate him that way like in the complicated renders. He's from his own little world\""]
["04:32,780","04:35,640","\"He's got a he's not from the earth Japanese features\""]
["04:35,640","04:40,160","\"Have you seen the true size of Japan compared to the east coast of America?\""]
["04:40,760","04:43,480","\"All of Japan could fit into Philadelphia City\""]
["04:43,480","04:46,360","\"It's a good thing that hasn't happened yet\""]
["04:46,360","04:49,120","\"They keep warning me about that\""]
["04:49,120","04:52,760","\"You know California is gonna go underwater eventually\""]

["04:57,220","05:01,460","\"But it was like 10 Japanese people there. There's just a drawing of Japan\""]
["05:01,460","05:05,280","\"They're like we are having trouble breathing with each other\""]
["05:05,880","05:08,960","\"Breathing yeah, okay their population is down\""]
