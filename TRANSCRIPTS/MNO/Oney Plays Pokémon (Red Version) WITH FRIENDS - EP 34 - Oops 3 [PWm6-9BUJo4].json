["05:00,460","05:02,940","\"Don't you like inventory man? I?\""]
["05:02,940","05:10,260","\"Never mind. It's okay in some games. Yeah, that's what I was gonna as about to say in Resident before\""]
["05:10,260","05:18,260","\"I don't like it in Demon's Souls.\""]
["05:18,260","05:21,260","\"Eric's Souls did away with it.\""]
["05:21,260","05:25,500","\"But I remember reading an article about that saying how it's an outdated concept and nothing\""]
["05:25,500","05:27,900","\"should use it, but it works for some games.\""]
["05:27,900","05:28,900","\"It works for Resident Evil.\""]
["05:28,900","05:29,900","\"I don't know.\""]
["05:29,900","05:33,420","\"Resident Evil is exactly what it's made for.\""]
["05:33,420","05:34,420","\"I don't know.\""]
["05:34,420","05:38,280","\"Does it like in a game where it's linear and you don't keep going back to the same\""]
["05:38,280","05:39,660","\"area then yeah.\""]
["05:39,660","05:42,220","\"If you can't keep going back to the same area, there's no point.\""]
["05:42,220","05:43,580","\"It depends on what kind of game it is.\""]
["05:43,580","05:45,380","\"It's something based on survival.\""]
["05:45,380","05:48,580","\"Like if that's a big part of it, then absolutely you need something like that.\""]
["05:48,580","05:51,020","\"But in like Demon's Souls, you'll be in the middle of a level and be like, \"\"You can't\""]
["05:51,020","05:52,020","\"pick this thing up.\"\"\""]
["05:52,020","05:54,380","\"And then if you quit to go drop items, you can't come back for it.\""]
["05:54,380","05:57,900","\"When it gets in the way, you know, when it gets in the way in something like this, for\""]
["05:57,900","06:00,500","\"example, that's when you know you did something wrong.\""]
["06:00,500","06:03,460","\"There's just no point.\""]
["06:03,460","06:08,100","\"There's inventory management because it makes it like more intense in the situation for\""]
["06:08,100","06:13,420","\"survival like Resident Evil that's fine. Oh I need to drop 20 different things\""]
["06:13,420","06:17,460","\"because my inventory is so full and I'm not struggling at all that I have too\""]
["06:17,460","06:20,900","\"many items so I need to throw everything out to get key items.\""]
["06:20,900","06:27,100","\"The mistake is just to have to put key items and disposal items.\""]
["06:27,100","06:30,100","\"That too key items get their own slot in later Pokemon games.\""]
["06:30,100","06:32,100","\"Whoa\""]
["06:32,100","06:36,180","\"Why you bump the controller\""]

["07:02,980","07:03,820","\"- Oh.\""]
["07:03,820","07:06,060","\"I just hope it didn't corrupt the data.\""]
["07:06,060","07:07,260","\"It probably wouldn't have, right?\""]
["07:07,260","07:08,100","\"- No.\""]
["07:08,100","07:09,260","\"- Because it wasn't saving at that time.\""]
