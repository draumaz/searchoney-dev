["04:13,600","04:14,600","\"in someone's eye socket?\""]
["04:14,600","04:16,840","\"you have to put it with other stuff.\""]
["04:16,840","04:19,080","\"- It's definitely more effective to build like a sword\""]
["04:19,080","04:21,920","\"if you wanna smash somebody's eye socket.\""]
["04:21,920","04:23,360","\"- Was that really necessary, Zach?\""]

["04:57,800","04:58,640","\"- Stop on it.\""]
["04:58,640","04:59,480","\"- Why are you afraid of that call?\""]
["04:59,480","05:02,560","\"It looks like some kind of thing.\""]
["05:02,560","05:04,280","\"- I don't know what that means, but I know that's\""]
["05:04,280","05:05,360","\"a cool piece of call.\""]
["05:05,360","05:08,920","\"- Check your recipe book.\""]
["05:08,920","05:11,640","\"So what should be our first fucking achievement\""]
["05:11,640","05:12,560","\"in Minecraft?\""]
["05:12,560","05:17,120","\"Let's build. I think we need to come up with some bold.\""]
["05:17,120","05:19,120","\"Like a goal here.\""]
["05:19,120","05:21,720","\"You know, we need a place to put the sewage.\""]
["05:21,720","05:23,920","\"It's going to keep piling up if we don't get it somewhere.\""]
["05:23,920","05:26,160","\"Yeah, let's make that our first endeavor.\""]
["05:26,160","05:29,160","\"All right. So we're going to create a working sewer system.\""]
["05:29,160","05:31,160","\"Yeah, yes, please.\""]
["05:31,160","05:34,160","\"Wait, what's this dirt? It's got yellow dots in it. What is this?\""]
["05:34,160","05:35,440","\"I think that's what you just been doing.\""]
["05:35,440","05:36,360","\"I think it's cool.\""]
["05:36,360","05:40,840","\"No stupid look. No yellow dots is yellow dots.\""]
["05:40,840","05:44,840","\"Oh no, I think the yellow dots are just like how you get experience points.\""]
["05:44,840","05:45,840","\"Are you trolling?\""]
["05:45,840","05:48,840","\"So you can just get them from any old activity.\""]
["05:48,840","05:49,840","\"Tomar, are you griefing me?\""]
["05:49,840","05:50,840","\"I am not.\""]
["05:50,840","05:52,840","\"I don't think that's any specific type of extra special.\""]
["05:52,840","05:54,840","\"Yeah, I think that's just normal stone.\""]
["05:54,840","05:55,840","\"Are you sure?\""]
["05:55,840","05:56,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:56,840","05:57,840","\"That's fucking cool.\""]
["05:57,840","05:58,840","\"Okay.\""]
["05:58,840","06:00,840","\"Hey, quit trolling grief.\""]
["06:00,840","06:02,840","\"Check your recipe.\""]
["06:02,840","06:05,840","\"Well, now you can make stone tools.\""]
["06:05,840","06:06,840","\"You're right.\""]
["06:06,840","06:07,840","\"I see what you're saying.\""]
["06:07,840","06:09,840","\"Maybe it is special because look at his different.\""]
["06:09,840","06:14,560","\"The yellow is definitely just, you just get it randomly and it's how you,\""]
["06:14,560","06:19,680","\"I think you later on can use it for stuff like, like magic.\""]
["06:19,680","06:22,720","\"Oh my craft, my craft.\""]
["06:22,720","06:26,880","\"Cause isn't there a whole thing where you can get like a book for making like magic stuff?\""]
["06:26,880","06:30,880","\"Tell me what chose to not, even acknowledge that you just made that fucking noise.\""]
["06:30,880","06:33,200","\"What, what, what's worth acknowledging?\""]
["06:33,200","06:37,040","\"What's worth acknowledging? That's the fucking meanest shit I heard.\""]
["06:38,480","06:41,480","\"You should say that to every fucking person you meet from now on.\""]
["06:41,480","06:44,640","\"You what's worth acknowledging?\""]
["06:44,640","06:47,720","\"You think there's anything you said to me that's worth acknowledging.\""]
["06:47,720","06:49,120","\"All right, buddy, keep talking.\""]
["06:49,120","06:50,720","\"Keep making me laugh.\""]

["06:53,360","06:55,320","\"I have a fucking mean that is you'll see.\""]
["06:55,320","06:59,360","\"This is the start of the sewer.\""]
["06:59,360","07:01,720","\"Chris pulls out a fucking sweet and she had to do.\""]
["07:01,720","07:03,600","\"Yeah, keep talking to him.\""]

["07:06,360","07:09,920","\"Um, how hard would it be to like make a little sewer and fill it with water first?\""]
["07:09,920","07:12,200","\"You gotta build the toilet bowl.\""]
["07:12,200","07:14,920","\"You can, you can make that out of stone for you.\""]
["07:14,920","07:17,120","\"I was talking about for real life for a second.\""]

["07:21,720","07:24,800","\"How hard do you think it'd be in real life to build a sewage system in your backyard?\""]
["07:24,800","07:25,800","\"I think pretty difficult.\""]
["07:25,800","07:29,280","\"The Romans did it in like 1905 or whatever.\""]
["07:29,280","07:30,280","\"In 1905.\""]
