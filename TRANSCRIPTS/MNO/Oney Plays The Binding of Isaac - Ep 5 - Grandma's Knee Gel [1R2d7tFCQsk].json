["17:59,120","18:05,480","\"I like it when they at least try something new. I feel like Mario's been kind of formulaic for a long time\""]
["18:05,480","18:11,240","\"Mario has that sort of like Disney thing going on where it's like you can't and you can't deviate too far from like\""]

["18:20,700","18:25,840","\"But then a hole open in the bottom of the plane and he started running like Fred Flintstone along the water\""]
["18:25,840","18:32,280","\"Would you rate the movie high or low just for that? I guess what what happens in the original film?\""]
["18:32,280","18:35,320","\"He just crashes into the river crashes into the river with a\""]
["18:35,320","18:39,400","\"Instead he puts his feet out and is just like I think I can do this\""]
["18:40,920","18:43,160","\"And he starts running really, really fast.\""]
["18:43,160","18:46,080","\"He runs so fast that they skim across the top of the water.\""]
["18:46,080","18:46,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["18:46,580","18:50,280","\"For like the next 30 miles until they make it to shore.\""]
["18:50,280","18:53,240","\"His legs are really thick and have three toes like Fred Flintstone.\""]

["19:11,720","19:14,420","\"That would probably make me scream and laughter.\""]
["19:14,420","19:17,320","\"But not knowing it going in.\""]
["19:17,320","19:20,240","\"If someone told me and ruined it for me, then I wouldn't do that.\""]
