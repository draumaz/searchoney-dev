["16:37,200","16:38,200","\"But we'll see.\""]
["16:38,200","16:42,700","\"Well, making a procedural game is one of the fucking hardest things you can do one. That's a super fun\""]
["16:42,700","16:48,140","\"Yeah, I was gonna say making it funs hard like this plenty of like really bland procedural game\""]
["16:48,140","16:51,020","\"That's what I'm saying like but procedural means they're not designed\""]
["16:51,020","16:56,060","\"So like you're gonna lose a lot of fun, but what I guess when they're controlled rules that they have, you know\""]
["16:56,060","17:00,800","\"Yeah, I was gonna say like a lot of people choose procedural because it's technically less work than\""]
["17:00,800","17:06,520","\"Well fuck you less work than hand designing everything if you want a really big game. Yeah\""]
["17:06,520","17:08,520","\"I\""]
["17:08,520","17:15,600","\"Do you see you still like it's not truly random so you still are basically designing everything yeah\""]
["17:15,600","17:21,120","\"Designing it in a way. That's like modular. Oh, I'm saying is cool. I like it\""]
["17:21,120","17:27,380","\"Why maybe I get a lot someday I'll make a game as cool as this\""]
["17:27,380","17:30,840","\"Chris you are as cool as you birdie\""]
["17:32,680","17:38,640","\"Here if you've been talking about the game you're making yeah, tell us about your game tell us about the game\""]
["17:38,640","17:45,520","\"Well, it's pretty cool. You can insert a coin and play it for five dollars\""]
["17:45,520","17:48,360","\"No five dollar coin\""]
["17:48,360","17:56,440","\"Yeah, you have to go to the bank and ask for the premium only only only five dollar coins just got your face on it\""]
["17:56,440","18:01,720","\"Oh, no, no, okay. I'll be serious. It's a it's it's gonna be a kind of a foodie\""]
["18:01,720","18:06,000","\"platformer and it's gonna be all about momentum and\""]
["18:06,000","18:12,000","\"I don't want to give away too much so you got to go fast. Yeah, it's all about high speed\""]
["18:12,000","18:14,440","\"It's all about\""]
["18:14,440","18:20,520","\"You know, like John Jack jumping fast. It's furious. It's it's a platformer. It's not a former\""]
["18:20,520","18:23,280","\"It's gonna be very speed and momentum based\""]
["18:23,960","18:27,160","\"Where you go slow what happens if you go slow you can go slow\""]
["18:27,160","18:32,520","\"But you I'm gonna have a lot of things that you can do to make make your own challenges\""]
["18:32,520","18:35,080","\"You should do it like that movie speed where if you go slow\""]
["18:35,080","18:37,720","\"You're like a shark you have to keep moving otherwise you die\""]
["18:37,720","18:41,560","\"It's honestly I'm trying to make it so like anyone can play it\""]
["18:41,560","18:47,360","\"But it's gonna have a high skill ceiling and it's pretty much four speed runners as well. That's gonna be fun\""]
["18:47,360","18:49,080","\"I don't want to give away anything about it\""]
["18:49,080","18:55,900","\"It's we're gonna have a trailer hopefully in March and then you'll find out. Have you guys ever watched any of those Mario speedrun?\""]
["18:55,900","19:03,080","\"Yeah, mothio like analysis things. Oh, yeah Mario 64 is so fun to watch people speedrun. I\""]
["19:03,080","19:04,960","\"like I\""]
["19:04,960","19:09,980","\"Had recently seen one of those things where they talk about like the what is it like?\""]
["19:09,980","19:14,940","\"455 is like that currently considered the limit to beating Mario one\""]
["19:15,020","19:20,420","\"Yeah, they're they keeps people are still playing that game and finding like weird little exploits where you can like jump through blocks\""]
["19:20,420","19:25,420","\"And literally all that stuff comes down to like frames like because of the wave\""]
["19:25,420","19:33,500","\"Apparently Mario runs at 60 frames per second like from a logic for s-boy. Yeah, but they but but it only like registers\""]
["19:33,500","19:37,180","\"certain things every 12 frames like wow like so\""]
["19:37,180","19:43,100","\"No, it's it's it's like really specific stuff like these glitches that people use like with the flagpole\""]
["19:44,620","19:47,120","\"Where if you like kind of\""]
["19:47,120","19:53,580","\"Like land on like this like one or two pixel point. Yeah on the edge of the flagpole\""]
["19:53,580","19:58,980","\"It'll skip the whole like flag coming down animation. Yeah, the the amount of time because like yeah\""]
["19:58,980","20:01,940","\"There's some kind of weird time frame that everything happens on yeah. Oh\""]
["20:01,940","20:05,420","\"One more thing I'll say about the game\""]
["20:05,420","20:11,940","\"I'm gonna make sure everything I've ever in my life bitch about will not be in the game\""]
["20:12,180","20:18,380","\"So this isn't like one of those reviewers who shit on movies and then make their own and it's like the worst fucking movie ever\""]
["20:18,380","20:23,300","\"I don't think so I think everyone I've shown it to had said it. They look school. That's cuz we're afraid of you Chris\""]
["20:23,300","20:29,020","\"No, we're afraid of your godfather like power. Yeah, I showed it to\""]

["20:40,660","20:45,940","\"Yeah, Dr. Tony I showed Tony in the game. He said yeah, you guys know Tony. He's the exp\""]

["20:50,340","20:55,300","\"Yeah, that's good game and he gave me pointers and I never would have thought of him as mafia\""]
["20:55,300","21:01,780","\"He's not he's a crazy sure sure but um one more thing is it's an adventure game and\""]
["21:01,780","21:06,500","\"There's gonna be no interruptions in the game. It's gonna\""]
["21:06,980","21:11,920","\"Can you tell us about the story? No. Oh, that'll come out later. It's gonna be a secret\""]
["21:11,920","21:17,240","\"I don't want to give away too much. I just wanted let it's gonna be an adventure 2d platform with lots of momentum and\""]

["21:24,320","21:30,100","\"Nice, and I don't I do not want a single guy than an interruption in that whole game\""]
["21:30,100","21:36,620","\"Yeah, that's it it's gonna have an intro though, right? Yeah, I know it'll have a story, but\""]
["21:36,620","21:40,780","\"It'll be like Devil May Cry or you push start you skip it if you don't want to listen to it\""]
["21:40,780","21:45,900","\"Also, there will be a log system like a little notebook where you can see what the story is\""]
["21:45,900","21:51,040","\"What's happened, you know that kind of shit? Yeah, you want the story you just don't want to force it on people\""]
["21:51,040","21:54,420","\"Yeah, I can appreciate it. It's not it's not supposed to be a deep story anyway\""]
["21:54,420","21:59,300","\"It's pretty self-explained. It's just a it's gonna be mostly about being fun to control\""]

["25:23,340","25:24,540","\"It really does.\""]

["28:14,160","28:15,000","\"- Yeah.\""]
["28:15,000","28:16,380","\"- You know, like have people say like ships\""]
["28:16,380","28:17,740","\"sailed over the ocean back in the day\""]
["28:17,740","28:18,700","\"and they were made of wood?\""]
["28:18,700","28:19,540","\"- Yeah.\""]
["28:19,540","28:20,380","\"- That's such complete horseshit.\""]
["28:20,380","28:21,220","\"- What do you mean?\""]
["28:21,220","28:22,740","\"- 'Cause water would just come in through the cracks.\""]

["28:23,580","28:25,220","\"- It's ridiculous.\""]
["28:25,220","28:28,980","\"- I think the wood on those ships was treated\""]
["28:28,980","28:35,180","\"in some way but yeah okay Alex Jones whatever they know there's really advanced\""]
["28:35,180","28:41,120","\"methods of like manual woodworking where you can like water seal wood stuff like\""]
["28:41,120","28:46,100","\"without you having like a modern type of like yeah okay Jesse Ventura okay\""]
["28:46,100","28:51,540","\"what is this book gate what what the hell do you think those ships were\""]
["28:51,540","28:57,340","\"otherwise made of look okay everybody swam back in the day\""]
["28:57,340","29:01,680","\"The deaths suck though, you know back in the day when they had like witch hunts like legit witch hunts?\""]
["29:01,680","29:03,760","\"They had to use dinghies to catch the witch and they...\""]
["29:03,760","29:04,240","\"*laughs*\""]
["29:04,240","29:05,040","\"little boats.\""]
["29:05,040","29:06,880","\"There's one paddle boats.\""]
["29:06,880","29:07,580","\"*laughs*\""]
["29:07,580","29:13,040","\"But it just sucks because one of the tests to prove whether you were a witch or not was whether you could like they'd throw you in water\""]
["29:13,040","29:17,280","\"and if you could swim you were a witch and if you drowned it's like oh I guess they were human.\""]
["29:17,280","29:18,180","\"Oh good job.\""]
["29:18,180","29:19,180","\"Yeah, I remember that one.\""]
["29:19,180","29:20,180","\"That fucking sucks.\""]
["29:20,180","29:22,680","\"And they made them hold firecrackers one second through one.\""]
["29:22,680","29:23,680","\"*laughs*\""]
["29:23,680","29:25,420","\"That'd be scary.\""]
["29:25,420","29:29,900","\"Was wanted to see what would happen if you stretch your nuts over a fire cracker and just let it oh\""]
["29:29,900","29:34,780","\"God get me out of this fucking room, please. What is the Sega Genesis?\""]
["29:34,780","29:37,900","\"Fuck me home are\""]

["29:52,140","29:58,700","\"Yeah, they do say it back, but maybe they're fucking stupid. Yeah, you know what because you're doing pretty good. Oh\""]
["29:58,700","30:02,420","\"God, I've seen your bank account didn't see that happening whoops\""]
["30:02,420","30:10,180","\"I hacked your bank account. Oh, I was killed by this thing in some cold place a mummy\""]
["30:10,180","30:13,680","\"Mommy boy, you died I'm sorry man\""]
["30:13,680","30:19,820","\"Dear diary today. I died. Well that was not fuck. Did I write this if I'm fucking dead?\""]
["30:20,940","30:25,100","\"Did you that was the last level one what does the code mean? That's what I want to know\""]
["30:25,100","30:31,980","\"That's your seed so that's the so if you want to redo this run you do the exact same thing\""]
["30:31,980","30:38,880","\"Yeah, oh that would let you do it. Yeah, so sometimes if you have a really fun build like you like game-breakingly funny\""]
["30:38,880","30:42,300","\"Like you're just shooting out like the whole screen just share these share\""]
["30:42,300","30:47,580","\"Seed and they can get the same items and they can have that yeah awesome experience\""]
["30:48,540","30:53,820","\"Minecraft had that 404 challenge where you type in 404 into the seed and you go down the hole right where you start\""]
["30:53,820","31:00,780","\"Does this game have any famous seeds the chalice dungeons, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait. What is this Minecraft thing?\""]
["31:00,780","31:05,980","\"Is this is creepy pasta? No, there was a famous Minecraft seed that you could type in that was 404\""]
["31:05,980","31:07,980","\"And it would start you next to a big hole, okay\""]
["31:07,980","31:10,580","\"And it was like supposedly the back in the day\""]
["31:10,580","31:13,020","\"It was like the scariest hole ever full of enemies and scary shit\""]
["31:13,020","31:18,500","\"But um I was wondering if this game had anything similar where it's like a famous seed that someone discovered that\""]
["31:18,500","31:20,260","\"I'm sure there is.\""]
["31:20,260","31:21,340","\"I'm sure there's something like that,\""]
["31:21,340","31:22,420","\"but there are things you can do.\""]
["31:22,420","31:24,300","\"Like there's cheats that you can turn on and off.\""]
["31:24,300","31:25,140","\"Yeah.\""]
["31:25,140","31:26,220","\"Using the seed system, I think.\""]
["31:26,220","31:27,260","\"I think it's through that.\""]
["31:27,260","31:29,100","\"But you can make enemy, you can do it\""]
["31:29,100","31:31,340","\"so like all of your items disappear immediately\""]
["31:31,340","31:34,420","\"and just make it dumb and hard.\""]
["31:34,420","31:35,260","\"I feel ya.\""]
