["01:56,700","01:59,540","\"Yeah, you crucify the guy\""]
["01:59,540","02:02,940","\"That's what that refers to right\""]

["03:55,700","04:00,740","\"earlier I'd like to believe they are yeah good they got what was coming to them\""]
["04:00,740","04:04,180","\"this thing's helping you're gonna go right back to your house and put that on\""]

["04:08,340","04:10,100","\"Oh, tell them all.\""]
["04:10,100","04:12,740","\"Then you'll be maggot, man.\""]
["04:12,740","04:16,340","\"Oh, you still gotta get one more.\""]
["04:16,340","04:19,820","\"See, I'm already so close.\""]
["04:19,820","04:22,100","\"You get so far.\""]
["04:22,100","04:23,980","\"All right.\""]
["04:23,980","04:25,740","\"There's got to be more shit to dig up,\""]
["04:25,740","04:29,180","\"because I still haven't found the key to the lighthouse.\""]
["04:29,180","04:31,180","\"Do you have to find that every day?\""]
["04:31,180","04:34,060","\"I mean, usually it's someplace easy, but yeah, today I\""]
["04:34,060","04:36,020","\"have no way in.\""]
["04:36,020","04:40,360","\"And how am I supposed to protect the ships from this horrible fucking weather?\""]
["04:40,360","04:43,320","\"If I can't get into the dang lighthouse.\""]
["04:43,320","04:44,980","\"Here's a point, Lyle.\""]
["04:44,980","04:46,580","\"That's true.\""]
["04:46,580","04:53,620","\"Wait, what the fuck? What was that fucking radio voice?\""]
["04:53,620","04:55,380","\"If it was a fucking weird crab...\""]
["04:55,380","04:57,480","\"What the fuck?\""]
["04:57,480","04:58,860","\"Radio crab.\""]
["05:05,500","05:06,500","\"Oh my god.\""]
["05:06,500","05:08,660","\"It's coming at you in blasting dubstep.\""]
["05:08,660","05:12,820","\"Whatever building I go to, I'm gonna have a shitty angle on the entrance.\""]
["05:12,820","05:15,020","\"Oh, he's getting close.\""]
["05:15,020","05:18,260","\"Yeah, I needed like dodge left and right more.\""]
["05:18,260","05:21,260","\"Oh, I don't know if that helped.\""]
["05:21,260","05:23,620","\"Yeah, it didn't really look like a good serpentine.\""]
["05:23,620","05:24,620","\"It's...\""]
["05:24,620","05:26,540","\"It's not a sniper.\""]
["05:26,540","05:30,180","\"It's a crab, a bug, a centipede.\""]
["05:30,180","05:32,180","\"Oh shit.\""]
["05:32,180","05:36,180","\"Where the fuck's the entrance?\""]
["05:36,180","05:40,180","\"It really seemed like he was going to get you there.\""]
["05:40,180","05:46,180","\"Okay. I think I want to go back to where he just chased me from, though.\""]
["05:46,180","05:49,180","\"I'm pretty sure he was guarding something.\""]
["05:49,180","05:50,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:50,180","05:56,180","\"I wish this game had like sliding around your ass physics, you know?\""]
["05:56,180","05:59,180","\"That would make truly a better game.\""]
["05:59,180","06:02,020","\"if it was like 2D instead of 3D.\""]
["06:02,020","06:06,540","\"And if it had like really good graphics rather than really bad graphics.\""]
["06:06,540","06:08,180","\"And...\""]
["06:08,180","06:09,900","\"You're mean. This is supposed to...\""]
["06:09,900","06:11,420","\"This is retro-perfect.\""]
["06:11,420","06:13,620","\"I love the graphics of this.\""]
["06:13,620","06:15,860","\"Yeah, it's really nicely made.\""]
["06:15,860","06:18,580","\"So wait, you said that this was inspired by the lighthouse?\""]
["06:18,580","06:19,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:19,100","06:21,580","\"How fast did they make this game then?\""]
["06:21,580","06:25,740","\"I mean, Lighthouse came out in 2019, and I do think this was like...\""]
["06:25,740","06:28,280","\"Made pretty quickly. It's not that long of a game\""]
["06:28,280","06:31,820","\"It's still pretty impressive\""]
["06:31,820","06:38,320","\"Yeah, here we go like if you can crank something out in a year just just like a finished product\""]
["06:38,320","06:41,520","\"I think that's pretty cool. I'd be proud\""]
["06:41,520","06:49,740","\"If I made this oh, they buried both of your things there are you buried both of your whatever either you went into a fugue state and\""]
["06:49,740","06:55,460","\"Can't remember which way I even came from the rain just got worse\""]
["06:55,460","06:58,700","\"Oh, there's the lighthouse.\""]
["06:58,700","07:01,140","\"There you go.\""]
["07:01,140","07:03,980","\"You're on track.\""]
["07:03,980","07:08,980","\"Good thing my lantern is invulnerable to water.\""]
["07:08,980","07:11,820","\"The PS1 Horace aesthetic is so good.\""]
["07:11,820","07:17,020","\"It's better to make a game that's functional and vague rather than something that's photorealistic\""]
["07:17,020","07:19,900","\"and barely functions and doesn't.\""]
["07:19,900","07:23,700","\"And most photorealistic stuff comes off and can't even matter what anyway.\""]
["07:23,700","07:31,300","\"Oh, that's it again. Are you fucking kidding me? What is I think that little whale and didn't that make that exact same noise\""]
["07:31,300","07:36,780","\"Before I got chased last time did it. You're inside already. So I'm good. I think I'm good\""]
["07:36,780","07:39,780","\"Oh, yeah, I guess I gotta fill up my can\""]
["07:39,780","07:45,300","\"Whoa, what the fuck?\""]
["07:45,300","07:52,820","\"I guess this was just lightning, but it was scary sound sound like a growl. That's a sound like to me too. Oh\""]
["07:52,820","07:57,460","\"Oh, and then the storm goes totally silent seriously\""]
["07:57,460","08:08,660","\"Yeah, that's such good acoustics that floor wasn't black before was it\""]
["08:08,660","08:17,740","\"There's that a goo thing it might be more goo what the fuck fell off the lighthouse the first time you looked at that window\""]
["08:17,740","08:21,460","\"What was I don't know for all I know it was just like a pigeon but\""]
["08:22,140","08:27,920","\"Or a seagull I mean yeah, it looked like guy shaped vaguely like it was it was like\""]
["08:27,920","08:32,100","\"It could have been a bird it could have been like the body of the last dude\""]
["08:32,100","08:39,880","\"It clearly was not like a crab or something whenever the fuck's chasing you it wasn't that\""]
["08:39,880","08:51,380","\"But whatever's fucking with you is clearly intelligent at least to some degree because it's cutting your ropes and shit\""]
["08:51,380","08:58,460","\"which is kind of funny he got to admit that's laws\""]
["08:58,460","09:07,740","\"do to crab with thoughts I would kill it I would hate that yeah I don't like\""]
["09:07,740","09:16,240","\"crabs any like bug that could walk upright and oh think yeah you can't see\""]
["09:16,240","09:27,280","\"shit up here yeah the view sucks I was idea was a door here oh maybe do this\""]
["09:27,280","09:32,360","\"I guess just go back to bed and just think about your beloved wife and all\""]
["09:32,360","09:39,600","\"that stuff wait oh stop moving wait really I gotta crank it all over again\""]
["09:39,600","09:40,600","\"What happened?\""]
["09:40,600","09:45,600","\"If this thing did it again...\""]
["09:45,600","09:52,600","\"Should I put on some beautiful music from our little grandma phone?\""]
["09:52,600","09:54,600","\"I think so. You could.\""]
["09:54,600","09:56,600","\"Alright, I'm gonna do it.\""]
["09:56,600","10:01,600","\"There you go.\""]
["10:01,600","10:07,600","\"I think that undoes the cranky when you come up here.\""]
["10:08,600","10:15,040","\"No, I mean it's still spinning. Oh, I think you're done here then. Think I want you to go back down\""]
["10:15,040","10:19,200","\"Okay\""]
["10:19,200","10:27,880","\"Kind of watch I want to watch the lighthouse now don't even let me oh wait there we go. Oh, oh\""]
["10:27,880","10:33,240","\"It just went dark. It did just go fuck. Well now I need to get more oil\""]
["10:33,240","10:36,600","\"Are you sure it's not like glitching right now?\""]
["10:36,600","10:44,660","\"That always sounds like a scary monster.\""]
["10:44,660","10:45,660","\"Yeah sure does.\""]
["10:45,660","10:46,660","\"Oh, okay.\""]
["10:46,660","10:49,180","\"Was that puddle there before?\""]
["10:49,180","10:51,660","\"I don't know.\""]
["10:51,660","10:55,060","\"I don't think it was.\""]
["10:55,060","10:56,660","\"I think that's new goo, my friend.\""]
["10:56,660","10:59,140","\"You want to go to the end of the goo hole?\""]
["10:59,140","11:00,140","\"It was locked still.\""]
["11:00,140","11:01,140","\"I checked it.\""]
["11:01,140","11:04,220","\"Oh, mother goo's can't let you in.\""]

["11:30,820","11:33,260","\"Yeah\""]
["11:33,260","11:36,820","\"No, I guess it wants me to go out here\""]
["11:36,820","11:39,900","\"Why I don't know\""]
["11:39,900","11:44,460","\"Dude this rain is moth armor. You're safe\""]
["11:44,460","11:47,980","\"Still can't see shit. I'll fuck\""]
["11:47,980","11:50,620","\"Turned off again. Yeah, what's going on?\""]
["11:50,620","11:54,460","\"Is this all part of the spook?\""]
["11:56,100","12:01,100","\"Think so this thing is like guzzling your fucking oil. I know right\""]
["12:01,100","12:03,740","\"It was never a problem before\""]
["12:03,740","12:10,220","\"Was that what the ink is is just taking your oil and fucking smearing it around the walls like an asshole\""]
["12:10,220","12:13,820","\"Maybe I don't know if it's that I maybe this crude oil like that\""]
["12:13,820","12:20,780","\"That would have sucked have to clean off then like if it's some kind of squid crab that eats gasoline\""]
["12:20,780","12:24,540","\"And then uses it to poop oil\""]
["12:24,540","12:31,580","\"I'd be pretty mad at it. Not gonna lie. Oh\""]
["12:31,580","12:38,420","\"Whoa, they're missing. Oh fuck he took it down to his little shitty seller\""]
["12:38,420","12:41,300","\"Great\""]

["13:42,940","13:44,300","\"I don't remember.\""]
["13:44,300","13:45,300","\"It was like this whole thing\""]
["13:45,300","13:47,180","\"where it was like this big air of mystery\""]

["13:48,540","13:51,780","\"- I'm sure they didn't sound like a monkey in there.\""]
["13:51,780","13:53,980","\"- That's a pretty good ending, honestly.\""]
["13:53,980","13:55,540","\"Tomar, weren't you talking about a show\""]
["13:55,540","13:57,420","\"that had an ending where it turns out\""]
["13:57,420","14:00,260","\"the entire show was like this well-crafted story,\""]
["14:00,260","14:01,860","\"but it turns out the last episode,\""]
["14:01,860","14:04,380","\"they didn't say, \"\"It's like an autistic kid\""]
["14:04,380","14:05,660","\"playing with a snow globe.\"\"\""]
["14:05,660","14:07,260","\"- Yeah, but St. Elsewhere.\""]
["14:07,260","14:09,540","\"- That's funny as shit I ever heard.\""]
["14:09,540","14:12,060","\"They had this entire show, like, and it was like--\""]
["14:12,060","14:13,220","\"- It's a hospital drama.\""]
["14:13,220","14:15,540","\"- It's a hospital drama, and in the final episode,\""]
["14:15,540","14:17,260","\"it turns out it was all in the brain\""]
["14:17,260","14:21,860","\"autistic child playing with a snow globe and his dad is just like I wonder what\""]
["14:21,860","14:25,300","\"goes on inside that all out of his I don't understand this autism thing\""]
["14:25,300","14:31,140","\"come it's just it's the funniest ending ever and people were really invested in\""]
["14:31,140","14:41,980","\"it oh oh oh the autistic is on the roof of the snow globe again fuck you\""]
["14:41,980","14:46,220","\"fall through. You didn't break your goddamn house, did he? Look up.\""]
["14:46,220","14:53,820","\"Take talk. Oh. It's fine in here. Oh, there's my lighthouse key at least.\""]
["14:53,820","14:58,780","\"The chest moved, I think. There's a picture of the Virgin Mary or something up there.\""]
["14:58,780","15:02,300","\"What to do? Pretty sure that wasn't there before, although I could be wrong.\""]
["15:02,300","15:06,860","\"Yeah, actually, I don't remember. You might want to get your accrues fixed.\""]
["15:06,860","15:22,560","\"It made a fucking mess. It sure did. Why the hell would he do that? Oh, was that implied\""]
["15:22,560","15:26,720","\"that? Oh, no, I guess it broke the roof and dropped a bird through. Yeah. Wait, when you\""]
["15:26,720","15:31,420","\"saw the thing moving, it like went through the roof and it like went out to the hallway\""]
["15:31,420","15:36,100","\"toward the other side of the house before the crash. I think it just was climbing, climbing\""]
["15:36,100","15:41,060","\"across to there. Okay, so probably just stuck its foot through the roof or something.\""]
["15:41,060","15:47,980","\"Why is there just one dead bird here though? It's saying you're going to be the bird someday.\""]
["15:47,980","15:53,300","\"Well I got to clean this mess up. I got to clean up the bird. And buy this mess. I specifically\""]
["15:53,300","16:03,780","\"just mean that one bottle because I can't pick up anything else. God. Well, I guess I\""]
["16:03,780","16:05,440","\"I gotta repair my house.\""]
["16:05,440","16:07,980","\"- I know, it's real foggy out.\""]
["16:07,980","16:09,180","\"- Oh sure is, huh?\""]
["16:09,180","16:12,340","\"I'm real quiet.\""]
["16:12,340","16:15,980","\"Look, all the ambience is gone.\""]
["16:15,980","16:19,820","\"- What do you call that?\""]
["16:19,820","16:22,660","\"(dramatic music)\""]
["16:22,660","16:24,780","\"- Oh, what's that?\""]
["16:24,780","16:26,500","\"- Some planks of wood,\""]
["16:26,500","16:30,760","\"some nails, a hammer,\""]
["16:30,760","16:33,500","\"and a ladder.\""]
["16:33,500","16:36,940","\"You can just put the ladder in your inventory.\""]
["16:36,940","16:38,260","\"Yeah.\""]
["16:38,260","16:44,020","\"At least we know this guy has really deep pockets if he gets into trouble.\""]
["16:44,020","16:48,140","\"So when that thing runs after you make him run under the ladder and then he'll fall off\""]
["16:48,140","16:49,140","\"the cliff for bad luck.\""]
["16:49,140","16:50,780","\"You get that bad luck.\""]
["16:50,780","16:53,380","\"Fuck that sounds like him.\""]
["16:53,380","16:56,660","\"Hope he don't come.\""]
["16:56,660","16:58,660","\"[laughs]\""]
["16:58,660","17:05,000","\"Alright, let's fix this stupid roof through mindless repetitive tasks.\""]
["17:05,000","17:06,520","\"Is it gonna be like that?\""]
["17:06,520","17:09,960","\"No, that's pretty intuitive.\""]
["17:09,960","17:10,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["17:10,960","17:13,500","\"And now we go put nails in.\""]
["17:13,500","17:15,040","\"[laughs]\""]
["17:15,040","17:19,200","\"And now we gotta put nails in.\""]
["17:19,200","17:26,440","\"[\""]
["17:26,440","17:31,440","\"- That's kind of satisfying.\""]
["17:31,440","17:37,040","\"- Okay, let's pound him in, boys.\""]
["17:37,040","17:38,140","\"- Use the cross.\""]
["17:38,140","17:40,760","\"- You think I can use the cross?\""]
["17:40,760","17:44,640","\"That might upset my sweet mother Mary.\""]
["17:44,640","17:45,880","\"- Downstairs.\""]
["17:45,880","17:46,940","\"- That didn't work.\""]
["17:46,940","17:49,600","\"- What hammering things in,\""]
["17:49,600","17:51,520","\"what do you think that the power of religion\""]
["17:51,520","17:53,200","\"would make you hammer faster?\""]
["17:53,200","17:54,040","\"- Yeah.\""]
["17:54,040","17:59,820","\"I don't know, maybe it would just be like a clever Easter egg that you could hammer it\""]
["17:59,820","18:01,580","\"in with the cross.\""]
["18:01,580","18:07,180","\"Oh, it just got a little darker.\""]
["18:07,180","18:08,180","\"No more fog.\""]
["18:08,180","18:12,500","\"That'd be a good like revenge story coming full circle, you know, after the nails go\""]
["18:12,500","18:18,100","\"into the cross all the time, the crosses used to hammer the nails.\""]
["18:18,100","18:20,780","\"Oh, look.\""]
["18:20,780","18:22,780","\"I knew that bird took that key.\""]
["18:22,780","18:23,780","\"A little key.\""]
["18:23,780","18:32,200","\"bastard. I still don't have the little a little four thing though do I? Nope. Well\""]
["18:32,200","18:37,900","\"that's probably why it wants you to go find right now. I guess well I think that\""]
["18:37,900","18:44,380","\"was the lighthouse key we just got so time to go to the lighthouse.\""]
["18:46,220","19:04,220","\"Yeah, don't do that. Sorry. It's already playing the music. Try checking here. Go get some freaking oil. Oh, yeah, you put them back. That's nice of them. Yeah.\""]
["19:09,220","19:12,300","\"Oh, it's open. What do you think?\""]
["19:12,300","19:25,100","\"Empty again, I would never go down into this gray room\""]
["19:25,100","19:32,180","\"Not even if you know what you know, these fucking textures like they're they fucking warp when you that actually hurts my eyes\""]
["19:32,180","19:36,700","\"Yeah, that's uh, that's a unity trick that people use for these games\""]
["19:37,300","19:40,420","\"They try to make it look like the Z buffer fucking up in the ps1\""]
["19:40,420","19:43,860","\"And it works looks good. Oh\""]
["19:43,860","19:50,460","\"No, I wouldn't go basically we're at the beginning of the game again. I think oh\""]
["19:50,460","19:55,260","\"Is this are you the same guy? I don't know if I'm this I don't think so\""]
["19:55,260","19:58,460","\"But it seems like the same things happen to us that happen to him\""]
["19:58,460","20:05,260","\"That record player needs to just go in the ocean off all right\""]
["20:05,260","20:19,700","\"Oh, it's spinning so good dude if I bought this lighthouse I'd be really sad. Yeah, I'd be pissed too\""]
["20:19,700","20:33,820","\"It's home I there's a tip like the lighthouse dude\""]
["20:33,820","20:39,620","\"I'll give you that one for free.\""]
["20:39,620","20:44,920","\"Now what?\""]
["20:44,920","20:47,540","\"I guess I'll take a stroll along the balcony.\""]
["20:47,540","20:49,700","\"Look at the moon, please.\""]
["20:49,700","20:54,620","\"Everything's going to bounce up from the beginning of the game.\""]
["20:54,620","20:55,620","\"Boing!\""]
["20:55,620","20:58,380","\"I was just getting ready to bounce.\""]
["20:58,380","21:10,180","\"I really you know what if I want to criticize this game for one thing I wish\""]
["21:10,180","21:13,980","\"that every time you came out into these different little areas I wish there was\""]
["21:13,980","21:19,900","\"one new tiny little creepy thing going on\""]
["21:19,900","21:25,340","\"but hey that's just big\""]
["21:25,580","21:30,260","\"Oh my god, what is that please that the thing man?\""]
["21:30,260","21:33,300","\"Get some off man\""]
["21:33,300","21:36,940","\"Christ\""]
["21:36,940","21:47,080","\"Oh, it goes the door. Oh god. Yeah, that's a really good moment. I'm pray at it\""]
["21:47,080","21:51,420","\"What wait did that work\""]
