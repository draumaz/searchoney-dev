["00:56,320","00:57,320","\"It would take so long.\""]
["00:57,320","00:58,920","\"- It doesn't take that long.\""]
["00:58,920","01:03,480","\"You know how to do it? You know the secret? No. You just keep buying the credits instead of gambling.\""]
["01:03,480","01:05,640","\"Oh, well that would... Yeah, we would still have to raise the money.\""]
["01:05,640","01:07,160","\"I want to pour it, God.\""]

["04:27,860","04:29,860","\"I remember not liking these birds. I\""]
["04:31,040","04:35,780","\"Think it's the one in saffron that has all the all the warp pads right\""]
["04:35,780","04:37,960","\"Pee pee up\""]
["04:37,960","04:41,480","\"Like a willy erect and he peepied up and it went in his nose\""]

["05:28,160","05:30,880","\"Yeah, I would have put like a couch in the TV there. Just sort of.\""]
["05:30,880","05:32,080","\"[MUMBLING]\""]
["05:32,080","05:41,320","\"They, uh... all these, like, sliding and teleporting pads used to be a big part of the Pokemon universe's technology.\""]
["05:41,320","05:45,360","\"Mm-hmm. And then they just stopped using it after a while. [LAUGHING]\""]
["05:45,360","05:46,920","\"I wonder who pitched this part.\""]
["05:46,920","05:51,360","\"Oh. Like as a game designer? Or like in the universe?\""]
["05:51,360","05:53,600","\"Yeah, both. Like... we need...\""]
["05:53,600","06:01,360","\"Who was like let's fill an entire floor with tiles that make you spin across the room that doesn't really fit into the overall gameplay\""]
["06:01,360","06:03,800","\"What did I do before me?\""]
["06:03,800","06:07,160","\"Spinny boy\""]
["06:07,160","06:09,640","\"He's very Japanese\""]
["06:09,640","06:15,840","\"It was a comedy boy very popular he he he he he wanted to make a game called spinny boy all\""]
["06:15,840","06:19,360","\"Let's make a game called spinny boy. Oh\""]
["06:22,880","06:24,880","\"Why did you come here?\""]
["06:24,880","06:35,480","\"Want you to be a voice actor me no ding-dong why why did you come here? That's what he said\""]
["06:35,480","06:39,400","\"You're through all the spinny tiles just to meet a little man\""]
["06:39,400","06:43,880","\"I love red it says sprite\""]
["06:43,880","06:47,360","\"Reddit always screams ah\""]
["06:47,360","06:49,760","\"He's always screaming in every sprite\""]
["06:49,760","06:52,200","\"He's trying to eat his own tail\""]
["06:52,200","06:55,100","\"Oh, he's dead.\""]
["06:55,100","06:57,140","\"Maybe he can succeed in the afterlife.\""]
["06:57,140","06:58,140","\"You shouldn't have used Thrash.\""]
["06:58,140","06:59,140","\"Oh, you could change.\""]
["06:59,140","07:01,980","\"I didn't know you could change in the middle.\""]
["07:01,980","07:03,900","\"Why shouldn't I use Swarish?\""]
["07:03,900","07:04,900","\"Because he continues doing it.\""]
["07:04,900","07:05,900","\"I don't care.\""]
["07:05,900","07:06,900","\"Nobody else will get a chance to level up.\""]
["07:06,900","07:07,900","\"I don't care.\""]
["07:07,900","07:08,900","\"I don't care.\""]
["07:08,900","07:09,900","\"Yeah, you know what I'm saying?\""]
["07:09,900","07:11,780","\"You can break this game so easily.\""]
["07:11,780","07:14,980","\"I'm sitting here thinking it doesn't balance his team correctly.\""]
["07:14,980","07:16,980","\"It's why I got Nittoking to begin with.\""]
["07:16,980","07:21,980","\"Nittoking is one of the best choices to speedrun through the game with because he's really\""]
["07:21,980","07:27,980","\"good at lower levels. Hmm. Is he bad at higher levels? He's not as good if you're\""]
["07:27,980","07:31,300","\"actually like taking this game seriously, but if you're just playing through it\""]
["07:31,300","07:38,180","\"normally. Who's I guess Mew Mew would cover him right? Because doesn't Mew have\""]
["07:38,180","07:42,500","\"one of the highest legendaries are all good in this game. Star me is really\""]
["07:42,500","07:46,220","\"good. Mew still has one of the highest stat totals doesn't he like it even in\""]
["07:46,220","07:51,020","\"the current gen? Or am I remembering that incorrectly? Mewtwo is probably the\""]
["07:51,020","07:56,660","\"absolute best if you're going for like any one period in this game. Star me is\""]
["07:56,660","08:00,800","\"really good. Should we get a star me instead of a karados? We should we should\""]
["08:00,800","08:06,540","\"get a star me at some point. Was there me so good? Because water and psychic are\""]
["08:06,540","08:11,940","\"like it's also really good stats. It's psychic? Yeah. Oh. Psychic was very\""]
["08:11,940","08:20,620","\"overpowered in this game. Is he a computer? Androdo roller. I'm gonna go\""]
["08:20,620","08:23,340","\"Oh wait, I'm sorry.\""]
["08:23,340","08:25,020","\"- So wait, something I was thinking about earlier,\""]
["08:25,020","08:27,380","\"- You always say I'm gonna.\""]
["08:27,380","08:28,860","\"- You say I'm gonna go.\""]
["08:28,860","08:33,500","\"- No, wait, something I was thinking about today is\""]
["08:33,500","08:36,740","\"in Pokemon, there's all these different like,\""]
["08:36,740","08:40,700","\"you know, classes of Pokemon like water and fire and psychic.\""]
["08:40,700","08:42,100","\"- Well, where's all the black people?\""]
["08:42,100","08:45,780","\"- No, but you're saying psychic is overpowered\""]
["08:45,780","08:46,620","\"in this game, right?\""]
["08:46,620","08:47,460","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:47,460","08:48,940","\"- Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\""]
["08:49,940","08:50,780","\"- Bad thing.\""]
["08:50,780","08:53,100","\"- I mean, it's bad for diversity, I guess.\""]
["08:53,100","08:54,940","\"- No, okay, but in that then--\""]
["08:54,940","08:56,100","\"- Well, it's bad on a game like this\""]
["08:56,100","08:58,300","\"'cause almost everything is just worthless then.\""]
["08:58,300","09:00,540","\"- I would say the goal is just to make the--\""]
["09:00,540","09:01,900","\"- The idea is-- - To make it complex\""]
["09:01,900","09:03,620","\"so that everything has a check.\""]
["09:03,620","09:04,980","\"- Right.\""]
["09:04,980","09:06,700","\"- It's already a very simple game,\""]
["09:06,700","09:09,700","\"so it kind of boils down to rock, paper, scissors sometimes.\""]
["09:09,700","09:12,980","\"But you would want rock, paper, and scissors\""]
["09:12,980","09:14,380","\"to all be choices, not just--\""]
["09:14,380","09:15,980","\"- It would be-- - Oh, rock is the best.\""]
["09:15,980","09:16,980","\"Just pick rock every time.\""]
["09:16,980","09:18,340","\"- Right. - That's what it turns into\""]
["09:18,340","09:19,660","\"by psychic games. - Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.\""]
["09:19,660","09:20,660","\"That's what I'm saying.\""]
["09:20,660","09:21,660","\"Now I get it.\""]
["09:21,660","09:25,420","\"Everything should have some sort of balance.\""]
["09:25,420","09:27,220","\"That's why they introduced Dark type.\""]
["09:27,220","09:28,220","\"And now I'm going to solve that.\""]
["09:28,220","09:32,260","\"I think I get the impression that like you know for the same reason that Venomoth and\""]
["09:32,260","09:35,100","\"Butterfree have their sprites switched.\""]
["09:35,100","09:38,460","\"I think they meant to program Ghost to be super effective against.\""]
["09:38,460","09:39,660","\"I mean that's what they said in the TV.\""]
["09:39,660","09:43,700","\"Yeah in the TV show they were always like oh Ghost is the only Pokemon that can defeat\""]
["09:43,700","09:44,700","\"Psychic.\""]
["09:44,700","09:46,220","\"I don't know what Steel was introduced for though.\""]
["09:46,220","09:48,060","\"Oh it's the elevator.\""]
["09:48,060","09:49,060","\"What was Steel introduced for?\""]
["09:49,060","09:50,060","\"To be cool.\""]
["09:50,060","09:51,060","\"Ummm...\""]
["09:51,060","09:53,060","\"I don't remember.\""]
["09:53,060","09:55,060","\"I don't even remember what steals me again.\""]
["09:55,060","09:57,060","\"I think steel resists psychic.\""]
["09:57,060","10:00,660","\"I think it was just another thing so that psychic wouldn't be the best thing.\""]
["10:00,660","10:02,220","\"Because steel, all I remember is it's-\""]
["10:02,220","10:04,220","\"They didn't introduce many steel types as the thing.\""]
["10:04,220","10:05,220","\"No, they did.\""]
["10:05,220","10:06,220","\"It was like, what?\""]
["10:06,220","10:07,220","\"Three of them?\""]
["10:07,220","10:08,220","\"Steelix.\""]
