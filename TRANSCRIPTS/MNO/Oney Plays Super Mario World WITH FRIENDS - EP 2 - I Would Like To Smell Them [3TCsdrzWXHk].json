["00:05,520","00:08,240","\"Why do kids lie about insignificant things like that?\""]
["00:08,240","00:10,560","\"And then Mario screams very realistically.\""]

["00:34,640","00:40,480","\"You would probably just assume like the black Pokemon cartridge was just like a kid that was trying to fuck with another kid\""]
["00:40,480","00:42,480","\"Rom hack or something. Yeah\""]
["00:42,480","00:47,000","\"You know how that's true the story that story was a bird\""]

["01:20,040","01:28,120","\"When if when Mario's screaming face didn't appear\""]
["01:28,120","01:39,320","\"I was very sad that the game wasn't haunted. I was completely normal. I was I was I rate I grab the TV and I said\""]

Okay, so when that happened, did they try to like, did he do the music video for that officially? Or did they just write a song and then he commissioned him to do a new song? And then he did.\""]
["02:49,880","02:56,200","\"video for it. Oh okay. If you translate it it says this is a cry for hell please\""]
["02:56,200","03:03,620","\"free us. I mean I assume the word new is not a word in whatever language. I\""]

["03:47,880","03:48,880","\"What's this problem?\""]
["03:48,880","03:51,360","\"I know does too.\""]
["03:51,360","03:52,360","\"It's true.\""]
["03:52,360","03:53,840","\"Oh, there you go.\""]
["03:53,840","03:55,800","\"Do they not like this one?\""]
["03:55,800","03:57,960","\"They don't like people downloading their games?\""]
["03:57,960","03:59,360","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["03:59,360","04:02,040","\"They don't like people making fan creations either.\""]
["04:02,040","04:03,040","\"They don't like a lot of things.\""]
["04:03,040","04:04,040","\"I feel like this one was-\""]
["04:04,040","04:07,800","\"They also don't like people playing their games and showing themselves publicly playing\""]
["04:07,800","04:08,800","\"their games.\""]
["04:08,800","04:11,760","\"That would be really unfortunate if someone did that.\""]
["04:11,760","04:13,640","\"They don't enjoy people smiling.\""]
["04:13,640","04:15,240","\"- I feel like this one was very popular\""]
["04:15,240","04:17,240","\"with like modding in particular.\""]
["04:17,240","04:20,400","\"- It was, it's cause Lunar Magic was really good.\""]
["04:20,400","04:23,360","\"- Which one is, there's like that one\""]
["04:23,360","04:25,080","\"that's called like Kizo Mario or something?\""]
["04:25,080","04:25,920","\"- Yeah, that one's forward.\""]
["04:25,920","04:30,720","\"- Is that one in Mario, is that one Super Mario World?\""]
["04:30,720","04:31,560","\"- Mario Strikers.\""]
["04:31,560","04:32,800","\"- I think so, yeah.\""]
["04:32,800","04:36,440","\"There's a lot that people have done with a--\""]
["04:36,440","04:37,440","\"- Like how the game was looking this way.\""]
["04:37,440","04:38,520","\"- Lunar Magic really opened itself\""]
["04:38,520","04:40,480","\"'cause you can do custom music, custom graphics.\""]
["04:40,480","04:42,480","\"You can just make it in your own game essentially.\""]
["04:42,480","04:44,240","\"- How come there's also the thing that you could do\""]
["04:44,240","04:45,580","\"the heck's-- - Whoa, wow, that guy\""]
["04:45,580","04:47,120","\"fucking ruined it. - Whoa, whoa.\""]
["04:47,120","04:48,840","\"- I was like the coolest-- - You can do that?\""]
["04:48,840","04:50,680","\"- The coolest naked cooper.\""]
["04:50,680","04:52,520","\"And you killed him anyway.\""]
["04:52,520","04:54,120","\"- That's what he gets. - But he made an impact.\""]
["04:54,120","04:55,560","\"- I can't fucking hit him.\""]
["04:55,560","04:57,400","\"- Press your head up from underneath, don't you?\""]
["04:57,400","04:59,240","\"- Yeah, you pop him, yeah, you,\""]
["04:59,240","05:02,520","\"and then it fucking slaps his tuckus and he dies.\""]
["05:02,520","05:05,160","\"- Oh, he slaps his tuckus.\""]
["05:05,160","05:07,280","\"- I don't know, like, having a gray block\""]
["05:07,280","05:09,560","\"implies he's made of stone, you can't do that.\""]
["05:09,560","05:15,740","\"You know, there's an onion spread of him covering his rear rubbing and going ow and it's all pink and sore and inflated\""]
["05:15,740","05:19,960","\"Is that like Yoshi sniffing sniffing the eggs or whatever\""]
["05:19,960","05:25,160","\"No, what do you like we've talked about that one enough to?\""]

["05:29,760","05:37,520","\"No, I'd probably it's the one copy pasta of the person going I wonder what Yoshi's egg smell like I would like to smell\""]
["05:37,520","05:39,520","\"Them ha ha it would be funny\""]
["05:39,520","05:42,120","\"It would be fuck you\""]
["05:42,120","05:47,080","\"Yeah, cuz he made me a post in a row talking to himself oh\""]
["05:47,080","05:50,240","\"Like did he think he was switching accounts?\""]
["05:50,240","05:57,480","\"Well, it's it was that he was saying like how wouldn't it be funny if you she pulled out naggin from Mario is really embarrassed\""]
["05:57,480","06:04,080","\"I bet it would smell really bad. You said that and then the last post he just makes his face. I'd like to smell them. Oh, yeah\""]
["06:04,080","06:13,600","\"It's the way you said who did that I know it's it's a famous screen cab. It's really funny\""]
["06:13,600","06:16,520","\"Wouldn't it be funny? Oh?\""]

["06:20,280","06:25,560","\"Oh, there's your running out of time behind. I'm not I'm cool. He's a little pervert\""]
["06:25,560","06:31,320","\"See how can Mario games have time limits when they're never like that bad\""]
["06:31,320","06:38,720","\"You're about to notice so you don't fuck around and waste your life it teaches kids that yeah, you don't have forever\""]
["06:38,720","06:40,360","\"That's fine\""]
["06:40,360","06:46,740","\"When I was really really young yeah, Mario rapidly ages while you're playing I despise time limits on games as a kid\""]
["06:46,740","06:51,320","\"I'm gonna break up bomber man world and they used to keep killing me\""]
["06:51,320","06:55,460","\"How come they don't let you take Yoshi inside cuz he's a fucking loser in these all rowdy\""]
["06:55,460","07:02,300","\"The actual what he's gonna make a mess. Let's step over. She's gonna poop everywhere. You can't take him in any houses\""]
["07:02,300","07:04,740","\"for castles I\""]
["07:04,740","07:10,260","\"Guess he's like a horse right like at least in this point of I mean he's got a saddle on him\""]
["07:10,260","07:15,580","\"Yeah, so so people know the furthest I ever got in this game was like just past the first water level\""]
["07:15,580","07:19,240","\"So it's all new all that oh no, it's still there. I thought it was gonna de-render\""]
["07:19,240","07:21,740","\"I like that they don't sound particularly heavy\""]
["07:22,340","07:28,860","\"Sounds like you are dropping like a cardboard box or something. Would you be happier of the audio peek every time I hit the ground?\""]
["07:28,860","07:40,600","\"It's a certain 64 games. Yeah, there's certain games that do that where it's like it'll stack like a bunch of sound effects\""]
["07:40,600","07:44,020","\"Yeah, I remember a lot of old 3d games doing that\""]
["07:44,020","07:47,100","\"It would always scare the shit out of me because it'd be so loud\""]
["07:47,100","07:49,100","\"Oh\""]
["07:49,100","07:55,700","\"Ball I remember the p-hats and I carry a time scare the shit out me because they're enormous\""]
["07:55,700","08:01,740","\"They slowed the game down and the audio from them was so loud the what's the P hats if you if you walked off the path\""]
["08:01,740","08:07,280","\"And I carry a time in the field they would come out of the ground and they would chase you the wait really a giant helicopter plans\""]
["08:07,280","08:13,340","\"Oh, they were freaky. Yeah, what were they scary because they were enormous and the framerate would drop when they were coming out\""]
["08:13,340","08:15,340","\"And it made it seem really dramatic\""]
["08:15,340","08:24,340","\"This truly is its own creepy pasta look he's alive again I killed him but he\""]
["08:24,340","08:26,780","\"didn't die\""]
["08:26,780","08:31,740","\"yeah that's why they put in the game you know now we just walks back and forth\""]
