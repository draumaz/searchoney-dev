["00:07,800","00:10,800","\"\"\"I like that you can do that to stay in the air longer.\"\"\""]
["00:10,800","00:13,520","\"\"\"I really like playing games for story anymore.\"\"\""]
["00:13,520","00:15,200","\"\"\"I like just messing around with them.\"\"\""]
["00:15,200","00:16,720","\"\"\"I like tasks and stuff.\"\"\""]

["00:18,360","00:20,240","\"\"\"It did, I opened the door.\"\"\""]
["00:20,240","00:22,040","\"\"\"That was very cold.\"\"\""]
["00:22,040","00:25,200","\"\"\"I was just seeing if there were those feathers everywhere.\"\"\""]
["00:25,200","00:26,120","\"\"\"Uh...\"\"\""]
["00:26,120","00:27,080","\"\"\"What are the feathers for?\"\"\""]
["00:27,080","00:29,920","\"\"\"Because in the banjo they were for flying, but he doesn't have...\"\"\""]
["00:29,920","00:39,200","\"wings with feathers. I'm guessing they're supposed to be like the music notes. Uh oh. I know there's\""]
["00:39,200","00:52,880","\"double jump I've been doing. Only two crouch. Oh! With boot! Press the boot button. I kind of like\""]
["00:52,880","00:58,080","\"that water actually. It reminds me of the old renders that they had from Banjo Kazooie when they\""]
["00:58,080","00:58,920","\"and they're under water.\""]
["00:58,920","01:01,520","\"- Is that, that's not a stock,\""]
["01:01,520","01:06,520","\"oh, these swimming controls are very strange.\""]
["01:06,520","01:09,640","\"- That's not a stock water effect from Unity, right?\""]
["01:09,640","01:10,480","\"Like crash?\""]
["01:10,480","01:12,000","\"- It might, because of the water.\""]
["01:12,000","01:12,840","\"- It might be.\""]
["01:12,840","01:14,640","\"- The water in crash looks fucking a business.\""]
["01:14,640","01:17,120","\"- It's because they're distorting it\""]
["01:17,120","01:19,600","\"and it's also, it's completely clear water\""]
["01:19,600","01:20,440","\"in the new crash.\""]
["01:20,440","01:22,360","\"- No, but the top of it, in this one, I mean.\""]
["01:22,360","01:24,320","\"- Oh, can you slide in your butt?\""]
["01:24,320","01:25,600","\"- Yeah, you go down slow.\""]
["01:26,960","01:31,040","\"I thought there was like a slide in your ass button that would be fun. I mean I can\""]
["01:31,040","01:36,240","\"Mario Mario Mario 3 had that was fun. This is what I liked about Crash 2\""]
["01:36,240","01:41,360","\"I don't I do all these little actions that make you just have fun playing even if it's just a fucking corridor\""]
["01:41,360","01:44,240","\"You're going down. I like the voices. They're fun by the way\""]
["01:44,240","01:47,520","\"I'll bring this up again banjo because we did have a tutorial at the beginning\""]
["01:47,520","01:50,000","\"But you had the option out the door to skip it or not\""]
["01:50,000","01:56,640","\"Hey, that's kind of like that. Listen, you don't know if we're gonna introduce some new mechanics that you don't know\""]
["01:56,640","02:01,640","\"I mean, he's such a snarky fuck.\""]
["02:01,640","02:03,640","\"I'm fine with that.\""]
["02:03,640","02:06,640","\"It actually controls pretty well outside of swimming.\""]
["02:06,640","02:12,640","\"It looks pretty comfortable to play without me having touched the controller yet.\""]
["02:12,640","02:16,640","\"It seems like you can actually do a lot more with your movement than you could in Banjo-Kazooie,\""]
["02:16,640","02:17,640","\"which is interesting.\""]
["02:17,640","02:20,640","\"Because that's the one thing I don't really like about Banjo-Kazooie is that if you're\""]
["02:20,640","02:25,640","\"going to try to speedrunner or something, for example, there's not too much you can do.\""]
["02:25,640","02:28,240","\"really limited and how you can move around.\""]
["02:28,240","02:29,080","\"Yeah, what's that?\""]
["02:29,080","02:29,920","\"- Yeah.\""]
["02:29,920","02:32,520","\"- Mmm, framerate.\""]
["02:32,520","02:33,360","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:33,360","02:34,520","\"- Give it a break.\""]
["02:34,520","02:37,260","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:37,260","02:39,100","\"- Give it like some breathing area.\""]
["02:39,100","02:41,040","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:41,040","02:42,840","\"- I heard it's a lot worse on console.\""]
["02:42,840","02:44,320","\"- There's the paper sign.\""]
["02:44,320","02:46,800","\"- The paper man by Disney.\""]
["02:46,800","02:50,040","\"Award winning, a war,\""]
["02:50,040","02:50,880","\"- Yes.\""]
["02:50,880","02:52,480","\"- Oh, Bob, oh!\""]
["02:52,480","02:54,120","\"- I don't know what I'm getting at.\""]
["02:54,120","02:56,060","\"- Oh, Julie, that's you.\""]
["02:56,060","02:57,160","\"- I made of gold.\""]
["02:57,160","02:59,500","\"- You're a big asshole.\""]
["02:59,500","03:01,960","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:01,960","03:04,600","\"- Your 20 feet tall, I made a gold.\""]
["03:04,600","03:06,000","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:06,000","03:07,400","\"- Jesus Christ.\""]
["03:07,400","03:08,240","\"- It scared me.\""]
["03:08,240","03:10,880","\"- That's because I always thought that was a funny bit.\""]
["03:10,880","03:11,720","\"- What is?\""]
["03:11,720","03:13,240","\"- That's a Simpsons thing.\""]
["03:13,240","03:14,080","\"- Is it?\""]
["03:14,080","03:16,800","\"- Remember Homer has a fantasy that he was 20 foot tall\""]
["03:16,800","03:17,640","\"and made him gold.\""]
["03:17,640","03:19,080","\"- Oh yeah.\""]
["03:19,080","03:21,120","\"- This is all hail king Homer.\""]
["03:21,120","03:22,560","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:22,560","03:23,440","\"- It was a funny bit.\""]
["03:23,440","03:27,440","\"was okay that looks really nice oh said no\""]
["03:27,440","03:32,880","\"yeah I'm you know I'm perfectly content with the\""]
["03:32,880","03:37,160","\"environments getting to see the game's first hand I\""]
["03:37,160","03:42,200","\"remember I remember thinking the color choices were pretty but this is\""]
["03:42,200","03:46,080","\"actually this is very solid I think I gotta I gotta give them a big\""]
["03:46,080","03:50,400","\"compliment oh well it's weird there but uh remember how we're saying and\""]
["03:50,400","03:54,760","\"Insane Trilogy, it's weird that you're using dynamic lighting because you can't line up jumps.\""]
["03:54,760","03:55,260","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:55,260","03:55,940","\"Look at that.\""]
["03:55,940","03:56,440","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:56,440","03:58,340","\"I have a fake shadow just so you can line up jumps.\""]
["03:58,340","03:59,500","\"That's very useful.\""]
["03:59,500","04:02,300","\"Uh, that was smart on them.\""]
["04:02,300","04:03,300","\"That was good.\""]
["04:03,300","04:07,300","\"I guess that's like collecting a jiggy.\""]
["04:07,300","04:08,300","\"Oh my god.\""]
["04:08,300","04:09,300","\"[Grunts]\""]
["04:09,300","04:10,300","\"[Grunts]\""]
["04:10,300","04:11,300","\"[Grunts]\""]
["04:11,300","04:13,300","\"He's a pagey.\""]
["04:13,300","04:17,300","\"There is a lot of stopping to talk to things in this game.\""]
["04:17,300","04:18,300","\"Yeah, sure is.\""]
["04:18,300","04:20,700","\"I mean, yeah, it was in bands of Kazooie.\""]
["04:20,700","04:22,940","\"It was in it, but there wasn't as much as this.\""]
["04:22,940","04:24,380","\"Because this is the opening of the game.\""]
["04:24,380","04:27,180","\"They want you to, they want you to like have a world building.\""]
["04:27,180","04:28,460","\"They're probably doing it because it's like,\""]
["04:28,460","04:30,300","\"\"\"Oh, it's a modern audience. They're not as bright.\"\"\""]
["04:30,300","04:33,340","\"And considering a lot of the people,\""]
["04:33,340","04:35,100","\"because you were bringing this up earlier,\""]
["04:35,100","04:37,580","\"you're talking about the giant bomb thing, right?\""]
["04:37,580","04:40,620","\"Were they, they were fighting the first boss in this game,\""]
["04:40,620","04:43,180","\"and the guy was saying how it's poorly designed?\""]
["04:43,180","04:45,500","\"Yeah, I didn't see it. You told me about this.\""]
["04:45,500","04:49,100","\"He fought the boss for like 15 minutes, not understanding it.\""]
["04:49,100","04:50,780","\"He hands the controller to somebody else.\""]
["04:50,780","04:56,140","\"Immediately they figure it out and he just keeps saying, \"\"No, it's, it's bad design.\"\"\""]
["04:56,140","05:01,260","\"And it's just like, \"\"Okay, well, no, you, you proved yourself wrong on that one.\"\"\""]
["05:01,260","05:02,580","\"Don't worry, everybody.\""]
["05:02,580","05:04,860","\"We'll have plenty of moments like that as we play it.\""]
["05:04,860","05:07,820","\"So it's sure to happen.\""]
["05:07,820","05:09,940","\"I actually like how this controls a lot though.\""]
["05:09,940","05:11,100","\"I know it feels really good.\""]
["05:11,100","05:14,380","\"Well, that's a good first impression, isn't it?\""]
["05:14,740","05:15,580","\"- Yeah.\""]
["05:15,580","05:19,660","\"- And for all my griping about how the main characters\""]
["05:19,660","05:22,060","\"are designed, you can kind of forget about it pretty easily.\""]
["05:22,060","05:24,660","\"- Yeah, that was the thing I was gonna say too is\""]
["05:24,660","05:27,900","\"I'm not a palm by it.\""]
["05:27,900","05:29,900","\"I just think they're very boring.\""]
["05:29,900","05:31,620","\"So I can't use these, yes.\""]
["05:31,620","05:33,140","\"- I'm kind of appalled by the bat.\""]
["05:33,140","05:34,220","\"I can't use this.\""]
["05:34,220","05:35,260","\"I don't know which one it is,\""]
["05:35,260","05:37,460","\"but I really don't like looking at it.\""]
["05:37,460","05:38,340","\"- Is it 'cause of the nose?\""]
["05:38,340","05:39,180","\"- It's, it's--\""]
["05:39,180","05:40,020","\"- Oh, it's the face.\""]
["05:40,020","05:41,100","\"- It's because of the nose.\""]
["05:41,100","05:42,660","\"(screaming)\""]
["05:42,660","05:46,220","\"I want to reserve that kind of design.\""]
["05:46,220","05:48,540","\"Wide faces creep me out.\""]
["05:48,540","05:49,900","\"You did the baby cry.\""]
["05:49,900","05:52,260","\"Oh, you hit A.\""]
["05:52,260","05:53,100","\"I told you, you told me.\""]
["05:53,100","05:54,340","\"Tell us one time about a baby.\""]
["05:54,340","05:55,860","\"This is how you did the cry.\""]
["05:55,860","05:56,700","\"I would want to--\""]
["05:56,700","05:58,300","\"That's because they try to spill their insides out.\""]
["05:58,300","05:59,140","\"I hate it.\""]
["05:59,140","06:00,140","\"(screaming)\""]
["06:00,140","06:01,140","\"What did they do?\""]
["06:01,140","06:02,500","\"(grunting)\""]
["06:02,500","06:06,260","\"I like that the chameleon does most of the talking.\""]

["06:07,100","06:08,940","\"Clayton.\""]
["06:08,940","06:10,740","\"Yeah, that kills.\""]
["06:10,740","06:11,580","\"Which one is which?\""]
["06:11,580","06:12,900","\"I don't know which one.\""]
["06:12,900","06:15,920","\"- Lulu is the boo loo and greeny is the weenie.\""]
["06:15,920","06:18,140","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:18,140","06:19,300","\"- Creamy is the weenie.\""]
["06:19,300","06:20,380","\"- He just snooed.\""]
["06:20,380","06:22,420","\"- What did you do that on purpose, Chris, or is that?\""]
["06:22,420","06:23,420","\"- It's a tick.\""]
["06:23,420","06:24,260","\"- Is that natural?\""]
["06:24,260","06:25,620","\"- It's a tick.\""]
["06:25,620","06:27,340","\"I've got a tick in my dick.\""]
["06:27,340","06:28,340","\"- And it makes me snort.\""]
["06:28,340","06:29,260","\"- And it makes me snort.\""]
["06:29,260","06:31,180","\"- And it makes me spec.\""]
["06:31,180","06:32,020","\"- Julian. - I just--\""]

["06:33,380","06:34,980","\"- Julian!\""]
["06:34,980","06:37,260","\"This game has good rendering.\""]
["06:37,260","06:38,980","\"- I do.\""]
["06:38,980","06:41,300","\"- The lighting's nice at points and another point.\""]
["06:41,300","06:43,660","\"- You know what, I'm not actually put off by this at all.\""]
["06:43,660","06:45,460","\"I was without-- - No, you can do that,\""]
["06:45,460","06:46,300","\"that's cool.\""]
["06:46,300","06:48,700","\"- Look at how harsh everybody was being about it.\""]
["06:48,700","06:51,220","\"I was expecting this out the door to be unplayable.\""]
["06:51,220","06:55,100","\"- I was, I mean, just because I'm very cynical about it.\""]
["06:55,100","06:56,060","\"- Yeah, that too.\""]
["06:56,060","06:59,340","\"It seemed like it was gonna be a solo recreation of Andrew\""]
["06:59,340","07:00,660","\"'cause he was here or something.\""]
["07:00,660","07:01,500","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:01,500","07:02,340","\"- It controls nice.\""]
["07:02,340","07:04,820","\"- That seems okay so far.\""]
["07:04,820","07:08,420","\"- I could do without how much of this they're doing\""]
["07:08,420","07:09,260","\"at the beginning here.\""]
["07:09,260","07:11,260","\"It's not a fucking like, war crime or something.\""]
