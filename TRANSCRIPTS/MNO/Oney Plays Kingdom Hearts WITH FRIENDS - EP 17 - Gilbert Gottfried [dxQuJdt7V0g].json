["00:01,880","00:03,120","\"Ar only please!\""]
["00:03,120","00:04,660","\"A Back\""]
["00:04,660","00:06,980","\"With friends\""]
["00:06,980","00:08,380","\"We stepped on somebody\""]
["00:08,380","00:10,200","\"Are you going to fight Sephiroth?\""]
["00:10,200","00:11,180","\"No V gib stayed off\""]
["00:11,180","00:13,840","\"I beat Sephiroth\""]
["00:13,840","00:17,180","\"I beat him the first time I fought him\""]
["00:17,180","00:19,160","\"in five seconds\""]
["00:19,160","00:21,820","\"He's really easy\""]
["00:21,820","00:27,360","\"It's not like it's a stupid fucking fight that you have to memorize\""]
["00:27,360","00:29,720","\"Would it be the end of this game?\""]
["00:29,720","00:35,800","\"I'm a rise because he teleports behind you when you're within a certain distance and you have to know that so you can bait out attacks\""]
["00:35,800","00:38,580","\"And you don't know that the first time you fight him well\""]
["00:38,580","00:41,200","\"No, so you get to you get to die immediately\""]
["00:41,200","00:46,000","\"I think it's I like games that put in the fucking really stupidly hard boss\""]
["00:46,000","00:50,020","\"Well the problem with that is you have to tediously go through all this to fight him\""]
["00:50,020","00:52,020","\"Oh, you like the intro and shit?\""]
["00:52,020","00:57,560","\"I didn't think about that. Don't you have to fight a hundred fights to get you and then if you lose you have to do it all over\""]
["00:57,560","00:58,760","\"No\""]
["00:58,760","01:04,180","\"You don't yeah, no if it's a tournament you have to start over I'm pretty sure you know\""]
["01:04,180","01:06,620","\"I'm pretty sure you don't I'm pretty sure there\""]
["01:06,620","01:10,020","\"It's always in the menu is like question mark question mark question mark and you can select the winner\""]
["01:10,020","01:15,820","\"You want that so then that would be great, but you I think you do have to sit through the intro every time. I'm not sure I\""]
["01:15,820","01:19,840","\"Remember having to do it over and over again. Maybe I remember\""]
["01:19,840","01:25,420","\"Remember the music was pretty cool. I did it when I was younger\""]
["01:25,420","01:30,220","\"Remember that's all there is to the fight is that just you memorizing how some of his attacks work\""]
["01:30,220","01:34,340","\"Also, he shoots the stupid fucking things out and because of the camera in this game and everything\""]
["01:34,340","01:35,340","\"Yeah, I keep track of them\""]
["01:35,340","01:40,020","\"Well the main thing about it is that the fighting in this game and item selection sucks\""]
["01:40,020","01:46,860","\"So that's the actual challenge you wail on him you run away and heal you go back like that's that's what fights turn into\""]
["01:46,860","01:49,580","\"If it had good controls good camera good item selection\""]
["01:49,580","01:52,140","\"I heard later games at least a lot more with combat\""]
["01:52,140","01:58,380","\"So it's not as shitty in later games. I don't really remember them two played better\""]
["01:58,380","02:00,220","\"I remember but uh\""]
["02:00,220","02:01,740","\"- fucking boring\""]
["02:01,740","02:06,960","\"Yeah, that's the problem is that it's I don't think it's very interesting even the worlds that I wanted to see like\""]
["02:06,960","02:09,260","\"Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean they were fucking boring\""]
["02:09,260","02:13,460","\"The liking levels embarrassing the play it is\""]
["02:13,460","02:17,700","\"And they brought back Nightmare before Christmas town, but it was worse somehow\""]
["02:17,700","02:21,060","\"He didn't use his pumpkin fire\""]
["02:21,060","02:26,460","\"Oh, I am Jack the skeleton boy\""]
["02:26,460","02:36,940","\"Like when goofy does the Homer scream when he gets hit does he yeah, I don't remember I haven't heard that yet\""]
["02:36,940","02:38,940","\"You just did it you guys\""]
["02:38,940","02:48,660","\"Jay Julian Jay Julian Jay Sherman Julian give me a stock give me a stock scream from you go\""]
["02:50,580","02:52,580","\"Give me a louder one. Whaaaaa!\""]
["02:52,580","02:54,580","\"*laughs*\""]
["02:54,580","02:56,580","\"OOOH! OOOH!\""]
["02:56,580","03:02,120","\"You know you make me want a shout. You know you make me want a shout!\""]
["03:02,120","03:08,380","\"It's Julian pull out my toenail and eat it. Okay. My toenail hurts right now.\""]
["03:08,380","03:12,380","\"What if instead of having more enemies in the game we just have the arms from the one boss?\""]
["03:12,380","03:16,820","\"It's better than dark souls.\""]
["03:17,380","03:21,540","\"Fucking use the ass of a fucking dead dragon and reg it to walk around and jump\""]
["03:21,540","03:26,900","\"I'm like, I don't know. I'm at a weird point where I don't know if I like Final Fantasy 7 anymore or not\""]
["03:26,900","03:27,960","\"Why?\""]
["03:27,960","03:34,460","\"Cuz I like the story. I like the story and I like the characters, but the as an actual game. It's really bad\""]
["03:34,460","03:37,060","\"I think it's really bad. I think it is\""]
["03:37,060","03:42,840","\"I don't I understand like just being frustrated because it's an RPG and it takes so goddamn long to do anything\""]
["03:42,840","03:44,840","\"I don't think it's really bad\""]
["03:45,020","03:48,680","\"Because I don't know I don't know if it's because I've played it so many times\""]
["03:48,680","03:53,740","\"That's perfectly I mean we didn't get that far in by the way. There's a lot I know but I've played it a lot\""]
["03:53,740","03:58,500","\"I'm saying there's a lot of like movies and stuff that I can't watch anymore because I've just watched I mean\""]
["03:58,500","04:04,860","\"We went and played metal slug three of the arcade near us and I feel kind of weird about because I've played it so many times\""]
["04:04,860","04:07,060","\"Yeah, I mean\""]
["04:07,060","04:11,900","\"So the first time you play you're like oh my fucking god same resume before yeah, res\""]
["04:11,900","04:15,620","\"full of moments where I'm like, \"\"Ugh.\"\" But it's like, but it's a really good game.\""]
["04:15,620","04:19,020","\"-It's full of Resident Evil 4, even the first time I played, I felt weird at points.\""]
["04:19,020","04:22,080","\"Well, the Falfa has the 7, though, like going back to it, I can even still...\""]
["04:22,080","04:25,100","\"-I just... I like the story. -I can notice flaws with it, but there never\""]
["04:25,100","04:30,700","\"anything that really impacted too much. I guess the mini-games I don't really like some of them.\""]
["04:30,700","04:34,140","\"-That's... I just mean the battling. It's just kind of boring.\""]
["04:34,140","04:39,340","\"-Ahhh, I think it's fine. What's weird about it is that if you know how to take advantage of\""]
["04:39,340","04:42,940","\"of material and everything. It just kind of gets broken because you don't have to try\""]
["04:42,940","04:46,940","\"and fight. You just have all these different tools open to you that you don't need to\""]
["04:46,940","04:52,020","\"think or do anything with it. For the most part it's really easy. The weapons are fun\""]
["04:52,020","04:56,980","\"to fight though. Yeah I know wept. Yeah but those are only like three battles. There's\""]
["04:56,980","05:01,500","\"harder enemies. There's the uh... I remember I had a lot of trouble with that when fucking\""]
["05:01,500","05:05,900","\"cave boss. There's the tower too where you fight through all the enemies and everything.\""]
["05:05,900","05:09,300","\"That was cool. There's fun stuff in there. There is fun stuff. I'm just saying.\""]
["05:09,300","05:13,040","\"It's like most of it. I wouldn't be bothered sitting through it again.\""]
["05:13,040","05:15,140","\"Plus there's optional bosses off to the side anyways.\""]
["05:15,140","05:15,640","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:15,640","05:18,880","\"There's plenty there to keep it fresh.\""]
["05:18,880","05:20,980","\"It all starts off kind of slow as the thing.\""]
["05:20,980","05:23,080","\"No, I think the start is the best part.\""]
["05:23,080","05:23,580","\"Really?\""]
["05:23,580","05:25,720","\"Yeah, I think the fucking bombing mission is really cool.\""]
["05:25,720","05:29,920","\"I think the start is where it's not so great in terms of combat because it's...\""]
["05:29,920","05:34,120","\"You don't have any options open to you and it's just the same couple of enemies.\""]
["05:34,120","05:34,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:34,620","05:38,620","\"But I love Midgar, like I think it's a really cool setting for the beginning.\""]
["05:38,620","05:42,140","\"Also makes it seem like the whole game's gonna take place there, but it's only like the first\""]
["05:42,140","05:47,100","\"Like eight ten hours. Yeah, and you get out of there. Well think of it this way fucking\""]
["05:47,100","05:52,600","\"Virgin River Wu Tai. Yeah, that place sucks. The place is boring as hell\""]
["05:52,600","05:58,340","\"Remember the snow place when you're running around the snow in the mountain that place sucks and it's boring as hell\""]
["05:58,340","06:05,680","\"Remember running through the mountains and mid or a mountain nibble or whatever a lot of these I didn't think we're boring and horrible\""]
["06:05,680","06:11,820","\"I just thought they're all right. I fucking hated it and get bothered by a lot of them. No the first time\""]
["06:11,820","06:15,080","\"It's fine, but if you do it a multiple times it's like I\""]
["06:15,080","06:19,240","\"Also, I\""]
["06:19,240","06:21,240","\"say this I didn't ever\""]
["06:21,240","06:24,280","\"any anything with the I\""]
["06:24,280","06:30,960","\"Really I really can't tell if it's just the fact I've played it so much or if it was just nostalgia\""]
["06:30,960","06:33,680","\"It might be playing it so much because when you're going through it again\""]
["06:34,280","06:39,000","\"Moments like that get the field tedious because you want to get through them to get the parts that you actually care about true\""]
["06:39,000","06:42,160","\"Because you know exactly what to expect and what you're gonna do\""]
["06:42,160","06:44,280","\"I remember the crater goes on maybe a little too long\""]
["06:44,280","06:46,680","\"That's what I was gonna say is we play through mouse like three again\""]
["06:46,680","06:54,240","\"And that's one of my favorite games, but same one of the boss fights. I get really bored doing it which one\""]
["06:54,240","07:00,760","\"the big the big thing that mask or that thing I don't I don't like that fight because\""]
["07:01,000","07:04,140","\"You don't like getting turned into coins. Well, that's easy to dodge\""]
["07:04,140","07:11,860","\"It's it's what I don't like about that fight is that his weak point is so tiny and he has a move that just shoots random things\""]
["07:11,860","07:15,700","\"That everywhere. Yeah, you can't you can't just stay there shooting at him\""]
["07:15,700","07:18,460","\"So it goes on for way too long if you're actually avoiding dying\""]
["07:18,460","07:23,020","\"So doing if you're actually gonna play that and go for no deaths and you're gonna do that fight\""]
["07:23,020","07:27,940","\"It just lasts forever and it's really boring and miserable putting up with it because of that not to mention\""]
["07:28,180","07:31,920","\"It's not really animated. It's just one big thing looks cool\""]
["07:31,920","07:35,260","\"But even though it's not that bad of a fight\""]
["07:35,260","07:39,500","\"Every time I go back to play it now. I always just kind of go like oh great\""]
["07:39,500","07:43,760","\"It's this one again. I think metal slugs 3s. Maybe one or two levels too long. I\""]
["07:43,760","07:48,400","\"Don't think so at all. Are you really because it's just because the last level is really long\""]
["07:48,400","07:54,920","\"The last level is the majority of the game the final mission is like an hour long the first four missions are very short\""]
["07:54,920","07:58,920","\"Probably like a half hour. Yeah. No, I'm insane. Like missions amazing\""]
["07:58,920","08:03,680","\"I love metals like three, but I never want to finish it when I started because I always get a little bored I\""]
["08:03,680","08:08,880","\"I can easily finish it just because the first four levels are so sure\""]
["08:08,880","08:12,320","\"I like the whole thing my favorite level is um is when the fucking\""]
["08:12,320","08:15,680","\"Messles are getting launched and you go up into space. Yeah\""]
["08:15,680","08:21,160","\"The final missions amazing. Yeah, probably one of the best final levels I played and like a 2d\""]
["08:21,160","08:27,720","\"I don't really like the underwater level. It doesn't go on too long. I don't like that. I don't I don't I like the kind of stealth\""]
["08:27,720","08:32,640","\"I like how it looks. I like the bit we have to dodge the yes. I like this zombie level\""]
["08:32,640","08:36,340","\"It's cool. Eels is the first level. I think he was talking about the third level. Yeah\""]
["08:36,340","08:40,320","\"Because the third level I always end up doing it\""]
["08:40,320","08:44,080","\"There's two paths you can take you can get an ostrich by going above the water\""]
["08:44,080","08:49,640","\"Yeah, which that one's all right if you go downwards you can you get a submarine and that part's not bad\""]
["08:50,000","08:55,200","\"But when you're just swimming without a submarine during that part of fucking sucks. It's not really fun. Yeah\""]
["08:55,200","09:01,200","\"But uh, well what I'm I like I like that about two that there's different paths because at least you can keep it fresh too\""]
["09:01,200","09:05,080","\"If there's one way you don't like doing you go different when I said it's like two levels too long\""]
["09:05,080","09:09,560","\"I think I'm just meant fucking I wish those levels were replaced with better ones\""]
["09:09,560","09:11,320","\"Yeah, I can kind of understand\""]
["09:11,320","09:13,080","\"I like the boss on that one though\""]
["09:13,080","09:17,680","\"I like how the level ends because you're like sneaking into the place with the cameras and everything\""]
["09:17,680","09:20,600","\"I think that part's cool. I think middle slug 3 is one of my favorite soundtracks\""]
["09:20,600","09:23,460","\"It's really good so cool and then\""]
["09:23,460","09:28,520","\"Then every game that came after that one because SNK got bought out by a different company\""]
["09:28,520","09:30,680","\"I have no idea how to do music anymore. Oh\""]
["09:30,680","09:33,240","\"The music sucked after that. Yeah\""]
["09:33,240","09:38,480","\"Wow, it's a bad voice\""]
["09:38,480","09:42,760","\"It sounds like only one\""]
["09:42,760","09:45,720","\"He was a good friend\""]
["09:45,920","09:47,920","\"And now he's dead.\""]
["09:47,920","09:51,920","\"Oh, Gilbert, of course he came in for this.\""]
["09:51,920","09:55,920","\"Do you think Gilbert Gottfried is funny?\""]
["09:55,920","09:59,920","\"I don't think I've ever seen any of his stand-up.\""]
["09:59,920","10:04,920","\"Do you like that? Almost everything he's known for is just voicing cartoon birds.\""]
["10:04,920","10:06,920","\"That's true.\""]
["10:06,920","10:13,920","\"(Silence)\""]
