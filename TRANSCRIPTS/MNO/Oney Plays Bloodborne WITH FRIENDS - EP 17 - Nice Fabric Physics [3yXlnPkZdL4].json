["01:37,680","01:40,760","\"but I honestly, when I go to see review things,\""]
["01:40,760","01:43,680","\"I find the skits that people insert into them\""]
["01:43,680","01:45,720","\"a lot of times really distracting.\""]
["01:45,720","01:46,640","\"- What's what we're talking about?\""]

["02:03,360","02:07,260","\"Well, think of it this way if you're making a review is the part if you're making a review\""]
["02:07,260","02:12,880","\"It's never anything actually interesting. They want to they want to have an excuse to like be like I'm evil and badass\""]

["02:16,080","02:21,380","\"No, but if you're like making a review like that, you're probably gonna get bored just editing you talking the whole time\""]
["02:21,380","02:24,440","\"So you want to feel creative and put a little story to it\""]
["02:24,680","02:29,460","\"It's because I imagine a lot of these people to they get into these spots. It's like oh I have an audience now\""]
["02:29,460","02:34,980","\"Yeah, I'm gonna start branching out into writing stories and everything. Oh, but I keep it in reviews to people actually watch it\""]
