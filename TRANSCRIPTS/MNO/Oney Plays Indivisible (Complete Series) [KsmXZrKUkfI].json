["34:18,300","34:27,060","\"But no course before I left I get what you're saying\""]
["34:27,060","34:31,980","\"It's weird that some main characters aren't like doing voice acting and it makes you feel like they're back characters\""]

["34:33,980","34:36,540","\"Your party this one this one is dialogue\""]
["34:37,540","34:42,660","\"But like the person who like introduces an important mechanic about like solstones doesn't mm-hmm\""]
["34:42,660","34:46,540","\"She wants us to find a couple resurrection lilies. Okay, so they're probably down here\""]

["35:17,900","35:18,900","\"It's mashing\""]

["35:34,860","35:39,080","\"I find that decision to make it like battlefield flip into the view of the ground to be the most\""]

["35:59,960","36:01,960","\"I know what the reason is.\""]
["36:01,960","36:03,960","\"It's just because they want more space between...\""]
["36:03,960","36:05,960","\"It's because of the real time combat.\""]
["36:05,960","36:09,960","\"Like, it's easy to put this flat this over because you're still on the game.\""]
["36:09,960","36:11,960","\"I don't know what it is now.\""]
["36:11,960","36:14,960","\"It's because the ground is like bending down the side and if it was flipped up,\""]
["36:14,960","36:18,960","\"they've got a shader so that all the characters appear over everything it looks like.\""]
["36:18,960","36:21,960","\"Yeah, the perspective looks 3D, but it's...\""]
["36:21,960","36:25,960","\"It's just the way the 3D is.\""]
["36:25,960","36:27,960","\"Maybe they just all look too close together.\""]

["37:13,840","37:17,800","\"I'm only exploded into like 400 bones and just blood and gore everywhere\""]
["37:17,800","37:21,560","\"And the characters reacted by throwing blood off of them. There you go\""]

["38:08,680","38:11,440","\"Little stupid bale at least that dude's properly\""]
["38:11,440","38:15,440","\"Whoa, it's like in full heal every couple seconds\""]
["38:18,520","38:24,080","\"I like his designs also. I think it's because she's a healer. I believe there's something there's like a portion of like the combat\""]
["38:24,080","38:26,580","\"We're not understanding because we haven't like properly read everything\""]
["38:26,580","38:31,860","\"I mean no, it's it's about like stacking combos when you get four party members\""]
["38:31,860","38:38,160","\"You basically create a combo so you see like x y x you can you don't have to press all of them at the same time\""]
["38:38,160","38:42,600","\"But if you press like x x y you do the comp you're supposed to stack combos\""]
["38:42,600","38:45,480","\"That's the point of the game you gotta find more go back the way you came\""]
["38:47,040","38:51,720","\"Dave Dave Dave will soon be in his grave. You're not stacking commas\""]
["38:51,720","38:58,080","\"But at the same time you're not really struggling with the combat, so it's not that bad. I really like these little outdoor scenes here\""]
["38:58,080","39:01,760","\"I don't even know how to fuck it up to that. You can do it twice in a row. Oh\""]
["39:01,760","39:05,360","\"Give it a shot. I don't know how to do it though. Well then\""]
["39:05,360","39:14,560","\"Oh\""]
["39:16,000","39:18,000","\"Watch out there monsters\""]
["39:18,000","39:22,600","\"Okay, you can only do it once I see oh\""]
["39:22,600","39:35,720","\"You hold X and then you let go it's kind of like putting your own little like bouncy thing out the wall then do it\""]
["39:35,720","39:37,720","\"Oh\""]
["39:37,720","39:55,560","\"This is like special magic shit up here good freakin old long\""]

["40:12,520","40:16,960","\"Like literally they all do it, but I don't know what the better solution be just blocking off doors\""]
["40:16,960","40:24,580","\"Needing a certain power to get the rest of your doors. It's just a double run. What's wrong with that? I don't understand it just seems\""]

["40:29,880","40:31,880","\"People say that it's very\""]

["40:44,780","40:50,540","\"Having hold on X. I mean you can't do that and it's a little weird, but I don't know it's just a little strange\""]
["40:50,540","40:52,700","\"I actually can't tell Jeff if that's a good thing or not\""]
["40:52,700","40:54,540","\"I don't either. I don't get that\""]
["40:56,540","41:02,060","\"It depends how you do it cuz like I would say Metroid does it really well. Oh god. I can't do this\""]

["44:41,300","44:42,980","\"I'm going to look like a more of an air of humor\""]
["44:42,980","44:47,960","\"Or just sort of like quirkiness. I honestly wish it was just more dark and they just made like really like edgy\""]
["44:47,960","44:53,500","\"More what you think this is dead serious. I kind of it's too quirky. It's kind of written like\""]
["44:53,500","44:58,860","\"It's to a like a standard anime dialogue, right? It is very standard anime\""]
["44:58,860","45:03,460","\"It's what you would expect for a game like this pass my my father forbids it\""]
["45:03,460","45:06,460","\"Like that it's just kind of yeah\""]
["45:06,460","45:09,420","\"Well there she goes\""]
["45:09,500","45:14,220","\"Nice just calling her babies. Oh wait. I'm still in the fight. Oh, yeah\""]
["45:14,220","45:17,740","\"Oh, you got to watch out for the leaves. That's where she comes down. That's kind of neat\""]
["45:17,740","45:20,280","\"I like how you can sort of exit sort of out of it. Oh\""]
["45:20,280","45:23,980","\"So that's what it is right, but on focus slows it down\""]
["45:23,980","45:26,980","\"Okay, cool. Talk\""]
["45:26,980","45:30,780","\"You're doing good. I have to unpunched it fucking once in the head\""]
["45:30,780","45:36,340","\"I like how this spider didn't like royally butt fuck you like the other two guys. What a tiny source\""]
["45:36,460","45:41,720","\"Why is the framerate dip there is that some you're doing there? It's like fuck. It's just the game doing that\""]
["45:41,720","45:48,500","\"Oh, what the fuck someone got some Dragon Ball Saka's inspiration. I do like a lot of the designs though\""]
["45:48,500","45:50,980","\"I do too and I do like the colors\""]
["45:50,980","45:56,700","\"Innovation's fucking awesome. I like the lighting inside of like dark does something with this composition\""]
["45:56,700","46:02,140","\"It's weird though like these characters are all such like poignant designs, and I feel like they're like not standing out very well\""]
["46:02,140","46:06,660","\"It's the there's shadows. There's no shadows. I don't see any shadows. Oh, yeah, there is that yet\""]
["46:06,660","46:09,380","\"They feel very disconnected from the background. Yeah\""]
["46:09,380","46:13,020","\"But I guess that's because it's like an anime and like a 3d background\""]
["46:13,020","46:15,140","\"Oh\""]
["46:15,140","46:20,180","\"It looks fine when it's zoomed out like that. I yeah, I really yeah\""]
["46:20,180","46:24,620","\"Why couldn't you just put the fucking game like this just zoom it in a tiny bit like that that's like right there?\""]
["46:24,620","46:26,620","\"That's a fucking mess. Look at that\""]
["46:27,340","46:32,100","\"Anyways, it looks pretty and the combat looks like it'd be fun to learn, but there's just certain things\""]
["46:32,100","46:35,500","\"They're just like come on. I want to see this looks nice. I want to see the background\""]
["46:35,500","46:37,340","\"I don't like how close it gets to the thing. I\""]
["46:37,340","46:44,140","\"Was freaking wrong earlier. I said it was so that if there's a curved surface a good zoom in and it wouldn't look so awkward\""]
["46:44,140","46:49,300","\"But there's no surface here. I'm not mean like it still wouldn't really matter the only thing I can think of is like\""]
["46:49,300","46:54,900","\"It's tilting up so it can give you more space between your characters on the same plane, but oh yeah\""]
["46:54,900","46:59,820","\"That's a good point too, but even then I don't know it's not really necessary. You could just put them yeah\""]
["46:59,820","47:03,500","\"You know further away from each other. Yeah, it's true horizontally\""]
["47:03,500","47:08,340","\"Okay, you see a dialogue\""]
["47:08,340","47:12,760","\"Like that just fade away fucking face with that dialogue her face is like\""]
["47:12,760","47:20,300","\"So they don't like Dar cuz Dar's like you're being dead without me\""]
["47:20,300","47:22,300","\"Chris can you be dead if you be out of my brain?\""]
["47:22,300","47:23,500","\"Can you take 2D...\""]
["47:23,500","47:29,840","\"Like the bushes in the background Chris can you do that and blend or like animate them to just sort of like bobbing and weaving like that?\""]
["47:29,840","47:31,340","\"That's really easy to do yeah.\""]
["47:31,340","47:33,340","\"That looks really nice.\""]
