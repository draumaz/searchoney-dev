["15:46,560","15:48,600","\"But they were like yeah you can watch MTV\""]
["15:48,600","15:51,000","\"and they put it on for me and I went into the kitchen\""]
["15:51,000","15:53,240","\"and then they obviously didn't stop watching it.\""]
["15:53,240","15:55,680","\"So I sat there and then that black girl in the show\""]
["15:55,680","15:57,760","\"was in the hot tub making out with someone else.\""]
["15:57,760","15:59,040","\"- Oh so that's the first episode.\""]
["15:59,040","16:03,040","\"Yeah, and it got real raunchy, and then my mom walked out, and she went, \"\"You're not allowed to watch this.\"\"\""]
["16:03,040","16:06,040","\"And I was like, \"\"I know.\"\" And it was really embarrassing.\""]

["16:08,040","16:11,040","\"I was like, \"\"I don't even like it.\"\" It's not even funny, Mom. She was like, \"\"Yeah, okay.\"\"\""]
["16:11,040","16:17,040","\"I'm talking about guilty pleasures. She'd make any contact with you, and she just said, \"\"You know we shouldn't be watching that.\"\"\""]
["16:17,040","16:21,040","\"And that's why I moved out. It wasn't allowed to watch it.\""]
["16:21,040","16:23,040","\"That was the inciting incident.\""]
["16:23,040","16:25,040","\"So it was on MTV over there?\""]
["16:25,040","16:26,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["16:26,040","16:27,040","\"That makes sense.\""]
["16:27,040","16:28,040","\"It was Comedy Central over here.\""]
["16:28,040","16:33,940","\"Think actually maybe it was on I don't know MTV directly competing with South Park and they really like talking about it\""]
["16:33,940","16:38,820","\"Yeah, I might be wrong. I think I really enjoy South Park. I heard the movies all about how much they love South Park\""]
["16:38,820","16:42,620","\"Remember MTV used to play SpongeBob in Ireland\""]
["16:42,620","16:47,700","\"MTV played Renan Stimpy later on. Mm-hmm. Did they actually yeah?\""]
["16:47,700","16:56,940","\"But any way enough about that maybe I'm fucking wrong about all of that. I don't know you're wrong about your memories\""]

["16:58,700","16:59,540","\"You've got that.\""]
["16:59,540","17:02,500","\"I watched through drawn together fairly recently,\""]
["17:02,500","17:05,060","\"and I'll say that like I said, I think hating it\""]
["17:05,060","17:07,260","\"is definitely the natural response.\""]
["17:07,260","17:08,780","\"I remember it.\""]
["17:08,780","17:10,580","\"Well, I was gonna say I remember occasionally\""]
["17:10,580","17:12,980","\"it had jokes that were funny, but for the most part,\""]
["17:12,980","17:15,580","\"it was just nothing.\""]
["17:15,580","17:16,900","\"It was just aimlessly frightening.\""]

["17:24,540","17:26,900","\"They're upset with South Park for having a point.\""]
["17:26,900","17:34,120","\"Yeah, I hate the fucking movie it hurts. It sure doesn't it was animated in a flash and it looked okay for flash. That's true\""]
