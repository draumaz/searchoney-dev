["09:00,040","09:06,520","\"That's all he was sad. This is he doesn't know what he's doing. Yeah, this is a cutscene. He does this canonically\""]
["09:06,520","09:11,320","\"Wow look at how real that is\""]
["09:11,320","09:16,640","\"Do you like how the snow gets real bright when he walks through it? Yeah\""]

["09:44,900","09:46,900","\"there's a oily dissonance\""]
["09:46,900","09:48,020","\"there's a\""]
["09:48,020","09:53,400","\"Slippery dissonance tell me what the real ones are loyal red dissonance okay loyal\""]
["09:53,880","09:56,340","\"Not listening to me. Do you play triangle dissonance?\""]
["09:56,340","10:05,040","\"What is Lugo go blobber the oh it's some shitty game journalist word that refers to basically what you just did\""]
["10:05,040","10:09,360","\"Where the character would never just stand there underneath?\""]
["10:09,360","10:12,240","\"fucking\""]
["10:12,240","10:19,720","\"Player can do that and it takes you out of the experience. Oh, so they think it's better if the game doesn't let you do anything fun. Yeah\""]
["10:19,720","10:27,040","\"Well no, so you're legitimately right it would be like if you killed 50 people in the game\""]
["10:27,040","10:32,940","\"And then there was a cutscene where your character kills a person and they get all oh about it. Oh no\""]
["10:32,940","10:34,940","\"This game there's a moment\""]
["10:34,940","10:38,700","\"Spoiler actually it's the moment that leads to this moment\""]
["10:38,700","10:42,420","\"There's a moment in the story because it flashes back to here where Drake gets shot\""]
["10:42,420","10:48,100","\"You could get shot like 50 times in the game and it doesn't matter at all, but he gets shot in a cutscene\""]
["10:48,100","10:52,720","\"Like there's why he's limping around right now. I don't think I even shot the gun there you\""]
["10:52,720","10:56,220","\"I think he just blew up for no reason\""]
["10:56,220","11:02,560","\"Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I did. I don't think I did you that was your one bullet that you used\""]
["11:02,560","11:04,600","\"so\""]
["11:04,600","11:10,000","\"I'm sure locking that yeah, maybe that guy just combusted so they so they basically just to wrap this up\""]
["11:10,000","11:11,740","\"So they don't want it like in this game\""]
["11:11,740","11:17,640","\"They would have it so you either your character is not being shot as a part of the game or or being shot in a cutscene\""]
["11:17,640","11:19,640","\"is not why he's hurt, I guess.\""]
["11:19,640","11:22,640","\"I mean, attention to detail like that is maybe bad or good.\""]
["11:22,640","11:23,940","\"Just watch a movie then.\""]
["11:23,940","11:24,940","\"I don't know what you want.\""]
["11:24,940","11:25,940","\"Watch a fucking movie.\""]
["11:25,940","11:27,940","\"The point of a game is that it's interactive.\""]
["11:27,940","11:28,940","\"I don't know.\""]
["11:28,940","11:33,060","\"It seems like, I guess it's a valid criticism in some cases, but with something like this\""]
["11:33,060","11:35,420","\"where the whole point of the game is...\""]
["11:35,420","11:37,420","\"Well this game kind of is like a movie.\""]
["11:37,420","11:39,420","\"Yeah, but it's not quite a movie though.\""]
["11:39,420","11:43,420","\"I mean, you're still moving or you're still controlling the character.\""]
["11:43,420","11:48,420","\"I love walking slow.\""]
["11:48,420","11:49,420","\"Yay.\""]
["11:49,420","11:53,420","\"That's what he's truly this generation's Mario.\""]
