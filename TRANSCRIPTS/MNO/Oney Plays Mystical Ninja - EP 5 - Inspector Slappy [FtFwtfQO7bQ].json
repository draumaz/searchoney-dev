["00:26,800","00:28,800","\"Why don't you get a dog?\""]
["00:28,800","00:32,500","\"Because I can't have a dog like that running around to cut my fingers on it.\""]
["00:32,500","00:33,500","\"Here's a plane.\""]
["00:33,500","00:35,500","\"I put my fingers on it.\""]

["00:47,900","00:49,340","\"That sounds like a Atari game.\""]
["00:49,340","00:50,340","\"Super Bridge Brothers?\""]
["00:50,340","00:53,940","\"Isn't there this current game that everyone's obsessed with called Poly Bridge?\""]

["01:04,780","01:05,780","\"It doesn't work.\""]
["01:05,780","01:06,780","\"You get it all in one fold.\""]
["01:06,780","01:08,780","\"That's the one I try to pull it one by one.\""]
["01:08,780","01:09,780","\"It's right.\""]
["01:09,780","01:12,780","\"I don't think candle wax works the same way as body hair wax.\""]
["01:12,780","01:14,780","\"Oh, that could be.\""]
["01:14,780","01:15,780","\"Have you ever been waxed?\""]
