["00:51,000","00:58,280","\"That was silly. It should not have given what actually happens in Mario Kart if you get the blue shell and then get up to first place\""]
["00:58,280","01:06,720","\"and then use it. I'd like to know. It's a paradox. Yeah, you just nuke yourself or does it go for the second place guy? I\""]

["04:52,840","04:56,180","\"Span so you could pretty much just make like all up hills down hills\""]

["11:07,720","11:11,560","\"There was no fucking chance in hell even if I had a thing\""]
["11:11,560","11:18,000","\"You think at least one of these guys if the reward for this is just to like race an alien at least somebody in here would\""]
["11:18,160","11:21,880","\"Realize that they're in a mine full of diamonds and jewels and golden shit\""]

["11:40,960","11:47,560","\"If you had like a mine of gold that had like a you knew for a fact it was cursed\""]
["11:47,560","11:52,780","\"But you just had the mine of gold would you just eat it and take the curse or I?\""]
["11:52,780","11:58,340","\"Mean yeah, it really does depend on what then what the curse is doesn't know fuck you don't know\""]
["11:58,340","12:00,340","\"It's just an unspecified curse\""]
["12:00,340","12:06,380","\"Oh someone sells you a mind. They're like or no, I guess what did you already?\""]

["12:10,980","12:15,780","\"It's like oh there's a mine of cursed gold under my house and I can either spend it and get the curse or\""]
["12:16,420","12:23,460","\"Ignore it. Yeah, just ignore it. Oh, fuck. Would you just take the curse? No, I mean maybe I'd like\""]

["12:28,540","12:34,500","\"Just just observe what the curse does to them over the the course of the coming week. That's very what if it's just like a\""]

["13:47,040","13:50,760","\"That'd be so funny. It'd be funny. Yeah\""]
["13:50,760","13:56,820","\"Would it yeah, but do you hate your mom? Yeah? Oh, okay? All right. That's fair\""]
["13:56,820","14:04,760","\"That would be a lay breeze. Oh no what oh that was scary. Oh, I didn't mean to do that\""]
["14:04,760","14:09,500","\"Dude, there's a really cool little shortcut here, but I'm not sure if I can do it\""]
["14:09,500","14:14,620","\"You might as well risk it. I'll try everyone will appreciate you if you pull it off here\""]
["14:14,620","14:17,600","\"Let's try it. I'll all loathe you if you don't\""]
["14:17,600","14:23,420","\"Couldn't do it fucking bastard. How can you jump over that? Yeah? Was that with a shortcut?\""]
["14:23,420","14:25,820","\"It's not much of a shortcut, but it's fun to pull up. Okay\""]
["14:25,820","14:28,660","\"Hey\""]
["14:28,660","14:30,660","\"What's the fuck fucking seal man?\""]
["14:30,660","14:35,780","\"That loose seal. Ah, that's so fucking unfair. I hate that\""]
["14:36,500","14:43,100","\"It should have saved that horrid green goo. I really don't like that part of this game or any kart racing game\""]
["14:43,100","14:45,100","\"I wish you could turn that shit off\""]
["14:45,100","14:51,980","\"Well like the rubber banding mechanics. No people just like shooting you with shit. You can't possibly avoid\""]
["14:51,980","14:58,460","\"Yeah, I mean it is kind of something where like it makes it sort of impossible to be\""]
["14:58,460","15:04,780","\"I mean you can be good at a game like this, but you can't be so good that you always win, you know\""]
["15:05,780","15:06,780","\"That's true.\""]
["15:06,780","15:10,380","\"Say that to the Crash Team Racing World Champion.\""]
["15:10,380","15:11,380","\"Maybe.\""]
["15:11,380","15:13,300","\"But they do have a thing?\""]
["15:13,300","15:14,300","\"They have difficulty options.\""]
["15:14,300","15:15,300","\"It's gotta be right.\""]
["15:15,300","15:16,300","\"Fucking go to hell.\""]
["15:16,300","15:20,740","\"I know you're not gonna see this like Evo, but...\""]

["16:09,860","16:10,700","\"- I think you got that.\""]
["16:10,700","16:12,140","\"- Zach has kind of set a precedent\""]
["16:12,140","16:13,420","\"for just getting up and leaving\""]
["16:13,420","16:15,460","\"in the middle of a game.\""]
["16:15,460","16:16,820","\"- You know what?\""]
["16:16,820","16:18,660","\"You're right, I'm gonna go pee.\""]
["16:18,660","16:19,580","\"Go pee, why not?\""]

["16:35,940","16:37,940","\"Fucking bastards.\""]
["16:37,940","16:41,940","\"That's just not fucking fair!\""]
["16:41,940","16:44,940","\"Every time with that exact same intersection.\""]
["16:44,940","16:46,940","\"I just wanna try the shortcut!\""]
["16:46,940","16:48,740","\"I wanna try it!\""]
["16:48,740","16:52,940","\"Tomar, why couldn't you code this game? You're smart.\""]
["16:52,940","16:57,340","\"I'm glad I did not have the responsibility of coding this game.\""]
["16:57,340","16:58,940","\"That's true.\""]
["16:59,740","17:05,020","\"I'm also not a programmer. I just do a little dabbling in it because I'm a systems engineer.\""]

["17:05,520","17:07,460","\"Go Crash, go.\""]
["17:07,460","17:08,260","\"No!\""]

["17:10,100","17:12,540","\"Dude, I fucking hate this part.\""]
["17:12,540","17:15,100","\"I used to remember this being one of my favorite levels too.\""]
["17:15,100","17:17,300","\"Okay, let's see. Let's see. Can we do it?\""]
["17:17,300","17:19,680","\"Oh, yes!\""]
["17:19,680","17:21,860","\"Fuck it, I did it finally!\""]
["17:21,860","17:23,940","\"And then I got killed by a missile. Fuck you.\""]
["17:23,940","17:26,180","\"That's the price you have.\""]
["17:26,180","17:26,900","\"Hey!\""]
["17:26,900","17:27,820","\"You actually held your lead.\""]
["17:27,820","17:28,740","\"Come on.\""]
["17:28,980","17:30,500","\"Did you win? No. Okay.\""]
["17:30,500","17:31,780","\"I did the shortcut.\""]
["17:31,780","17:38,660","\"You got to the shortcut spot for a third time and literally just landed on a nitro crate.\""]
["17:38,660","17:41,860","\"God damn it. Chris, you okay?\""]
["17:41,860","17:46,180","\"No. You seem like you're getting a little antsy around this one.\""]
["17:46,180","17:47,620","\"You're probably right.\""]
["17:47,620","17:50,580","\"The snowmulls. You must have heard the scream from the bathroom.\""]
["17:50,580","17:51,140","\"I did, yeah.\""]
["17:51,140","17:55,140","\"That was when the ultimate fucking embarrassment happened.\""]
["17:55,140","18:00,620","\"That was the the nitro crate though and then immediately after the nature of trade he get hit with like another missile\""]
["18:00,620","18:05,240","\"It was just like a little injury - he went through two full like burnout\""]
["18:05,240","18:11,100","\"Animations, I'm not saying that you should maybe like superstitiously avoid that shortcut\""]
["18:11,100","18:15,360","\"But it seems to have only turned out bad for you. No, look at this. You did it this life fuck\""]
["18:15,360","18:18,060","\"telling you man. Oh\""]
["18:18,060","18:24,260","\"It's like the Campbell's curse of this game. Is it Campbell's curse? Yeah, it's like um\""]
["18:24,260","18:34,260","\"It's a football thing where like any time a football athlete does a Campbell's commercial immediately after that their team starts fucking sucky.\""]
["18:34,260","18:39,260","\"Really? I thought you were going to say they tear their ACL or something. So it just purses your team?\""]
["18:39,260","18:46,260","\"I guess. I mean it might be something more specific like that. Like the player themselves, something bad happens to them.\""]
["18:46,260","18:48,260","\"Or like the Scottish play?\""]
["18:48,260","18:50,260","\"What's the Scottish play?\""]
["18:50,260","18:54,260","\"Because actors are superstitious about Macbeth, they call it the Scottish way.\""]
["18:54,260","19:00,260","\"Because supposedly everyone who's ever in a production of Macbeth has some tragically life-shortening...\""]
["19:00,260","19:01,260","\"Fuck off.\""]
["19:01,260","19:04,260","\"Experience or pretty mature death.\""]
["19:04,260","19:10,260","\"Really? Just completely unrelated to it? Or is there a hard part of Macbeth that if you don't pull it off right you get injured?\""]
["19:10,260","19:11,260","\"No, no, it's definitely...\""]
["19:11,260","19:12,260","\"Like that Spider-Man musical or whatever.\""]
["19:12,260","19:14,260","\"It's definitely its own...\""]
["19:14,260","19:17,260","\"Like, yeah, it's nothing to do with the actual play itself.\""]
["19:17,260","19:24,360","\"It's just that like a lot of actors won't do a production of Macbeth because they think it's cursed really just superstitiously. Yeah\""]
["19:24,360","19:27,800","\"That's strange. Oh\""]
["19:27,800","19:33,280","\"What about the thing that the Brian Cranston it was in where he's like Lyndon B. Johnson or whatever\""]
["19:33,280","19:37,400","\"There occurs around that. I don't think there's an LBJ characters\""]
["19:37,400","19:43,620","\"Okay, and the omen and the exorcist had weird fucked up shit happen. Well the exorcist that that that well\""]
["19:43,620","19:47,700","\"- Oh, okay, yeah, I think like a guy had like a thing fall on him during the exorcist, right?\""]
["19:47,700","19:50,860","\"- Yeah, and-- - But also the girl, they like jerked her around and now--\""]
["19:50,860","19:54,700","\"her, she's like horribly fucking disfigured or something, or she has like really bad back problems.\""]
["19:54,700","20:02,260","\"- Oh. - Because they like ripped her around on the fucking like flying cord to make her look all possessed by the devil and whatnot.\""]
["20:02,260","20:04,380","\"- Oh, that sucks. - Yeah.\""]
["20:04,380","20:06,700","\"- Reagan? - Ronald Reagan?\""]
["20:06,700","20:09,740","\"- Yeah, he was the little girl. - Ronald Reagan, the little girl.\""]
["20:09,740","20:12,940","\"- Oh yeah, that's my favorite role of his. - Your mother sucks Cox.\""]
["20:12,940","20:17,020","\"- Oh, that sucks. - He's Nixon Chris.\""]
["20:17,020","20:25,980","\"- Your mother sucks Cox and hell. - Ronald Reagan says-- - Ronald Reagan says-- - That's the other one with a curse, the Nixon presidency.\""]
["20:25,980","20:31,740","\"- That one was cursed. - You got the cum balls? See that? Yeah, I love cum balls. I know.\""]
