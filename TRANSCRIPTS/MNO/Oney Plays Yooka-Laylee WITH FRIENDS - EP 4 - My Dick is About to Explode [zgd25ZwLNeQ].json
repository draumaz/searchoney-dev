["00:19,520","00:25,040","\"You know? You're on the first fucking world!\""]
["00:25,040","00:27,960","\"I heard the first world is the best one and then I'll get progressively worse.\""]
["00:27,960","00:29,280","\"That's true, I've heard that too.\""]
["00:29,280","00:30,280","\"We'll see.\""]
["00:30,280","00:33,200","\"But why don't we come to our own conclusions?\""]
["00:33,200","00:34,440","\"Are we going to get that far?\""]
["00:34,440","00:36,240","\"That was why I didn't play it.\""]
["00:36,240","00:38,080","\"I wanted to see how it was.\""]
["00:38,080","00:40,840","\"And I'm like it now.\""]
["00:40,840","00:46,760","\"So I'm starting to think that maybe people just don't know how to play 3D platformers\""]
["00:46,760","00:49,320","\"now because there hasn't been one such a long time.\""]
["00:49,320","00:51,520","\"You know, people very angry with you.\""]

["00:56,120","01:00,360","\"People really like when games fail nowadays,\""]
["01:00,360","01:02,680","\"they get very excited to see things fail.\""]
["01:02,680","01:04,160","\"- They like big drama shit shows.\""]
["01:04,160","01:05,600","\"- Yep.\""]
["01:05,600","01:06,840","\"Which this was becoming.\""]
["01:06,840","01:08,200","\"- So, so far, would you argue\""]
["01:08,200","01:11,120","\"that this is the first good Kickstarter game?\""]
["01:11,120","01:12,120","\"- No.\""]
["01:12,120","01:13,360","\"Are you kidding me?\""]
["01:13,360","01:14,520","\"- What's another good example?\""]
["01:14,520","01:15,440","\"- Shovel Knight.\""]
["01:15,440","01:17,720","\"- Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that that was Kickstarter.\""]
["01:17,720","01:21,400","\"- Shovel Knight, I had no expectations for whatsoever\""]
["01:21,400","01:23,840","\"'cause it's like, oh, it's trying to be Nintendo platform\""]
["01:23,840","01:24,680","\"or whatever.\""]
["01:24,680","01:28,060","\"Then I played her and it was, I played through it repeatedly.\""]
["01:28,060","01:29,400","\"- So, first day I loved it.\""]
["01:29,400","01:31,840","\"- Is, okay, so is there a third example then?\""]

["01:39,480","01:43,080","\"- I mean, there's games like Undertale\""]
["01:43,080","01:44,640","\"that didn't raise too much money,\""]
["01:44,640","01:46,280","\"but it ended up all right.\""]
