["13:33,700","13:35,420","\"Oh, fuck him up.\""]
["13:35,420","13:37,940","\"I think you can get him when he jumps down.\""]
["13:37,940","13:43,920","\"Yeah, that's your that's your opportunity to do that. You have to make it drop down on him. I could sure as hell try\""]

["14:07,860","14:08,860","\"What do the eggs do?\""]
["14:08,860","14:12,400","\"- You suck on your toes and your egg cracks open.\""]
["14:12,400","14:14,500","\"- Yes.\""]
["14:14,500","14:16,340","\"You know, there's like a thing that people make\""]
["14:16,340","14:18,540","\"like silicon eggs that they put up their ass\""]
