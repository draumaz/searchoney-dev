["04:45,520","04:48,520","\"I'll take this, I'll take this, I'll take this.\""]
["04:48,520","04:50,520","\"- But that's a good way of doing it.\""]

["07:09,520","07:11,520","\"I didn't expect it\""]
["07:11,520","07:15,820","\"What were you expecting? It's a 2d platformer. You have a check point. Oh, if you was a checkpoint\""]
["07:15,820","07:19,500","\"I didn't expect that I thought it would just be from the beginning. What are you people expecting?\""]
["07:19,500","07:22,540","\"I thought I always hear how fucking terrible\""]
["07:22,540","07:28,040","\"Gex is so I thought it was gonna be a piece of shit because they're thinking of the sequels no one ever played the first one\""]
["07:28,040","07:31,620","\"The first one is just an all right little 2d platformer\""]
["07:32,660","07:37,160","\"Like it looks nice. I there none of this is offensive to me. No\""]
["07:37,160","07:43,020","\"Like I said, it's cuz it was on the 3d offers so it couldn't really be a 3d game yet\""]
["07:43,020","07:45,280","\"Then they made it a 3d game and a fucking suck\""]
["07:45,280","07:46,500","\"I guess that you know\""]
["07:46,500","07:53,620","\"That's probably what it was was that if you weren't 3d at a certain time you just like got you got that's absolutely you got sunk\""]
