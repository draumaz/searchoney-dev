["04:35,080","04:35,800","\"Looks like O.J. Simpson.\""]
["04:35,800","04:38,840","\"Like O.J. Simpson killed two people, allegedly.\""]
["04:38,840","04:41,840","\"But uh, then nobody brings up the second murder.\""]
["04:41,840","04:43,080","\"You're right.\""]
["04:43,080","04:44,800","\"No one ever brings up that dude.\""]

["12:36,000","12:41,560","\"Yeah, so if a guy spits it out when you hit him or if you can do something to get it without\""]
["12:41,560","12:49,640","\"Necessarily just having it regenerate. Yeah, you're basically just rewarded for getting like hits in yeah kills. Yeah, that's good. I like that\""]
["12:49,640","12:58,960","\"I remember the first time I went in here. I died a few times getting used to the combat so this room\""]
["12:58,960","13:02,200","\"Yeah, so it may history may repeat itself\""]
["13:02,200","13:08,580","\"Like the key to this game is really just staying mobile, okay\""]
["13:08,580","13:15,640","\"Like you never want to like duck somewhere for too long kids. They'll blow up cover and shit\""]
["13:15,640","13:18,400","\"that and just\""]
["13:18,400","13:25,000","\"It's just not the kind of game that encourages you to use cover is like like yes while you're resting\""]
["13:25,000","13:31,740","\"But like in general you just got to keep moving. I want to grab some help fuck yeah health in the center dude\""]
["13:31,740","13:33,740","\"Health in the center. Yeah\""]
["13:33,740","13:37,880","\"Yes, they don't they don't fucking hold your hand at all at this game\""]
["13:37,880","13:41,640","\"I didn't know you were such a historian Tomar because it was clearly repeated\""]
["13:41,640","13:47,960","\"I told you can I try with the mouse. Yeah sure. Yeah, you'll probably be able to aim better. I\""]
["13:47,960","13:54,520","\"Really hate this like period metaphor right here like do I really want to see this up close?\""]
["13:54,520","13:59,460","\"My name is like women and I'm always gonna poop out a soft egg\""]
["13:59,460","14:11,920","\"There's a good bit of lag tomer maybe that's why you think so yeah look look at my hand\""]
["14:11,920","14:22,080","\"Oh he's really low if you hit him with one more melee oh nice good job\""]
["14:22,080","14:24,080","\"Oh\""]
["14:24,080","14:27,120","\"Who the fuck\""]
["14:27,120","14:31,160","\"It's me. He's regular walk to the middle of the room and\""]
["14:31,160","14:37,360","\"Spring you walk to the middle of the little seal\""]
["14:37,360","14:48,560","\"Tomo what the fuck it? What is this thing? It's a little radar dish wait in here. Yeah, and I put a hold F F for fuck me\""]
["14:48,560","14:59,280","\"Yeah, and then watch the room. This is cool. Whoa. Oh, this is like a visual effect. Cool.\""]
["14:59,280","15:03,200","\"Now it's just a regular ass room\""]
["15:03,200","15:09,200","\"You cleanse the distortion. That's just like fell down. Jesus intended\""]
["15:09,200","15:17,840","\"Yeah, I'm a Watson. We did it. I'm a Watson. She just kind of looks like her to me. She looks she's a real human being Chris\""]
["15:17,840","15:22,020","\"She's based on a real person who looks like it's emollots and it's not\""]
["15:22,020","15:27,400","\"I can't tell you how it's Courtney hope there she is\""]
["15:27,400","15:38,680","\"Emily Pope my turn should I lie yeah, Jesse Faden\""]
["15:38,680","15:42,960","\"I should have lied\""]
["15:42,960","15:44,960","\"Shit you're the new director\""]
["15:44,960","15:48,220","\"Hold on we're coming out\""]
["15:48,220","15:51,560","\"Oh shit\""]
["15:51,560","15:57,140","\"Shut up. No swearing. This is my house, and you're not allowed to swear in it\""]
["15:57,140","16:04,580","\"Ooh, who's this mama? That's Emily Pope. I was wrong this whole time\""]
["16:04,580","16:07,900","\"She's clearly pissed off that a woman half her ages are boss\""]
["16:07,900","16:17,200","\"\"\"Look, somehow this hostile force, this hiss, that works, somehow the hiss managed to infiltrate the building without any warning.\"\"\""]
["16:17,200","16:18,220","\"That he is.\""]
["16:18,220","16:21,200","\"\"\"My name for it is official, the hiss.\"\"\""]
["16:21,200","16:24,200","\"\"\"It seems to have spread everywhere and to everyone.\"\"\""]
["16:24,200","16:28,700","\"They have big gummy mouths, it's weird. Something uncanny about it.\""]
["16:28,700","16:34,000","\"That maybe partially because of us turning down some of the settings.\""]
["16:34,000","16:35,000","\"Maybe.\""]
["16:35,000","16:37,700","\"\"\"The trench is no longer the director, obviously.\"\"\""]
["16:37,700","16:40,420","\"but it's definitely part of a facial mocap rigor.\""]
["16:40,420","16:42,420","\"- It looks better from a distance.\""]
["16:42,420","16:44,300","\"Like this looks fine,\""]
["16:44,300","16:46,900","\"but when it gets close, it's kind of bizarre.\""]
["16:46,900","16:48,340","\"She just looks good.\""]
["16:48,340","16:51,060","\"Maybe it's just, they put less effort into that character.\""]
["16:51,060","16:53,020","\"- Yeah, it's gonna say you're the main player model.\""]
["16:53,020","16:55,180","\"You're gonna get all the parties.\""]
["16:55,180","16:56,020","\"- Do I tell her?\""]
["16:56,020","16:57,100","\"- All the parties.\""]
["16:57,100","16:57,940","\"- All the parties.\""]
["16:57,940","16:59,380","\"- The service weapon.\""]
["16:59,380","17:02,900","\"Also, and this can sound crazy,\""]
["17:02,900","17:05,660","\"but he keeps appearing to me,\""]
["17:06,820","17:09,060","\"Same things like fart\""]
["17:09,060","17:15,840","\"Make out but he told me to cleanse the control point. I'd be pretty glad the hiss out\""]
["17:15,840","17:20,640","\"If a guy said fart to you. Yeah, and then that man was suspended in the corner like an idiot\""]
["17:20,640","17:25,920","\"What would you do if a big burly like biker dude just walked up to you and said fart and walked away?\""]
["17:25,920","17:29,420","\"I'd probably just laugh. Yeah, that would be fucking hilarious\""]
["17:29,420","17:32,900","\"I'd be happy\""]
["17:32,900","17:41,620","\"Yeah, I can't even shut up\""]
["17:41,620","17:50,860","\"Then you can maybe cure those infected or possessed by the his you can throw them across a room\""]
["17:50,860","17:52,860","\"I mean is that good enough?\""]
["17:52,860","17:55,940","\"Very different\""]
["17:55,940","17:58,660","\"Emily Pope I\""]
["17:58,660","18:01,340","\"Don't know where but I like her already\""]
["18:02,220","18:08,200","\"She's the opposite of the faceless agency. I blame for what happened to me for so long. How do you know that?\""]
["18:08,200","18:12,320","\"You're the opposite of all the bad things I don't like I\""]
["18:12,320","18:20,320","\"Know multiple things and you're the opposite of them. I'm shipping these two video game characters from this stay onward\""]
["18:20,320","18:23,160","\"Good idea\""]
["18:23,160","18:30,540","\"Yeah, are you going to that corner guy over there that's like floating I want to be this guy\""]
["18:30,540","18:34,160","\"You want to compare this to Dark Souls those control points or your bonfires\""]
["18:34,160","18:41,060","\"Okay, they do here. They are the one thing that heals you other than just normal healing stuff\""]
["18:41,060","18:47,060","\"Good oh\""]
["18:47,060","18:50,220","\"My god\""]
["18:50,220","18:54,700","\"Okay, well now she's just regular dead\""]
["18:57,420","19:00,140","\"Whoa, oh yeah an improvement for sure\""]
["19:00,140","19:05,220","\"You deep the hiss\""]
["19:05,220","19:14,340","\"The his fucking sucks dude, it's the worst name I've ever heard yeah, she was so proud of it too\""]
["19:14,340","19:22,620","\"Travel she made it a point to coin it and just like that my name for it is official if you had a point you could fast travel\""]
["19:24,020","19:27,500","\"Yeah, I can wear your tactical response. I look great\""]
["19:27,500","19:31,020","\"Where do I go tell me?\""]
["19:31,020","19:37,020","\"There's a bunch of talking stuff, but yeah, I guess you go into that boardroom get your next mission\""]
["19:37,020","19:43,100","\"You can go in the shelter if you really want isn't this more fun though here\""]
["19:43,100","19:45,780","\"Push some stuff around\""]
["19:45,780","19:52,180","\"Well, let me do it in here. Oh, that's right. This is the one room where like fun doesn't allowed to happen. Yeah\""]
["19:53,820","20:00,060","\"Uh, that is a thing where I wish they would just let you do it and then everyone would shoot and kill you and then you could say at least I did it.\""]
