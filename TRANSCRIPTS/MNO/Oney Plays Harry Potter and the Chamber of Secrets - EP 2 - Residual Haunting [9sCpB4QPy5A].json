["00:07,680","00:10,080","\"Little Harry's back.\""]
["00:10,080","00:11,720","\"Better than ever.\""]
["00:11,720","00:14,120","\"Watch go spriting the toilets.\""]
["00:14,120","00:16,480","\"Does that Ron that just walked past the end?\""]
["00:16,480","00:18,680","\"Does- does that Ron? They hurt you.\""]
["00:18,680","00:21,360","\"This is exactly how the last dream ended.\""]
["00:21,360","00:22,800","\"*laughter*\""]
["00:22,800","00:24,480","\"Is that nearly headless Nick?\""]
["00:24,480","00:25,720","\"That's just fucking-\""]
["00:25,720","00:27,120","\"I mean, he's got a head, but...\""]
["00:27,120","00:29,280","\"That silly Strutsworth, he just starts to run.\""]
["00:29,280","00:30,360","\"So he struts away.\""]
["00:30,360","00:32,880","\"Also, when you see a ghost, you just want to run through it.\""]
["00:32,880","00:34,200","\"So that's not my fault.\""]
["00:34,200","00:36,960","\"It looked like his pathfinding was going to go through the side\""]
["00:36,960","00:39,800","\"of the door, and then he just sort of scooped in.\""]
["00:39,800","00:42,160","\"Oh, Ron's pissed.\""]
["00:42,160","00:43,920","\"Coming, babe.\""]
["00:43,920","00:45,480","\"Is that ghost going to keep coming back?\""]
["00:45,480","00:47,120","\"Is that like a residual haunting?\""]
["00:47,120","00:52,080","\"He keeps coming on Harry's back throughout the novels.\""]
["00:52,080","00:53,320","\"I'm following you.\""]
["00:53,320","00:55,000","\"Look at him go.\""]
["00:55,000","00:56,480","\"Are you slowing down to follow him,\""]
["00:56,480","00:58,240","\"or is it just you're doing it yourself?\""]
["00:58,240","01:00,140","\"- Such tiny, tiny chill.\""]
["01:00,140","01:02,680","\"- But amazingly, I'm actually like not passing him out\""]
["01:02,680","01:05,580","\"or trailing behind like most games.\""]
["01:05,580","01:07,600","\"- Yeah, I hate when games slow you down to walk.\""]
["01:07,600","01:09,080","\"- Like Assassin's Creed, I'm pretty sure\""]
["01:09,080","01:11,920","\"none of the walking speed ever suits anything else, right?\""]
["01:11,920","01:12,760","\"- Why did they do that?\""]
["01:12,760","01:14,440","\"Why did they make games where the walking speed\""]
["01:14,440","01:16,280","\"is always slightly less than you would do\""]
["01:16,280","01:17,720","\"just simply walking?\""]
["01:17,720","01:18,560","\"- To annoy you.\""]
["01:18,560","01:19,400","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:19,400","01:20,240","\"- It's literally the only possible reason.\""]
["01:20,240","01:21,560","\"- To absorb more of the scenery.\""]
["01:21,560","01:23,320","\"- Just to fucking say, fuck you gamers\""]
["01:23,320","01:24,160","\"we're still making money.\""]
["01:24,160","01:25,000","\"- You should have walked to lock you\""]
["01:25,000","01:28,040","\"into some kind of cut scene like area.\""]
["01:28,040","01:33,320","\"Maybe once you feel better if you like whimsically running ahead of the person while the AI tracking is trying to catch up\""]
["01:33,320","01:37,000","\"I would feel better. That's more fun. Oh, I'm gonna fuck Ron\""]
["01:37,000","01:40,920","\"But people complain that it breaks the immersion don't fuck me hurry\""]
["01:40,920","01:45,120","\"I don't know who those people are you know it breaks the immersion when I'm running full stop and suddenly come to a\""]
["01:45,120","01:48,520","\"That is him. Oh, there's nearly headless name\""]
["01:53,520","01:59,300","\"Why see nearly headless his head is clearly still attached to him. Wow, it's only nearly head looks like you don't know much about Harry Potter\""]
["01:59,300","02:01,300","\"You don't\""]
["02:01,300","02:07,200","\"What is it being held together with a fucking one thread of skin a little piece of scotch tape really?\""]
["02:07,200","02:09,640","\"He died with the scotch tape\""]
["02:09,640","02:15,260","\"Was that Mona Lisa? Do you see that that is the Mona Lisa? Where right under the stairs?\""]
["02:15,260","02:18,160","\"What the hell EA steals art you can't do that\""]
["02:18,160","02:21,800","\"She's not a wizard or why she she probably was oh\""]
["02:22,600","02:28,680","\"Look at all these fits in with these pieces of art. Yeah, I fucking bomber girl right there fucking hate this child\""]
["02:28,680","02:33,480","\"He's definitely the son of a that's the avatar. That looks like something that'd be on the mad cover\""]
["02:33,480","02:38,000","\"Yeah, I know I'm admiring some art you fucking fool look at that\""]
["02:38,000","02:45,040","\"Is that nearly fucking missing her body Sarah? That's nearly touches you but decides not to McGee\""]
["02:45,040","02:47,160","\"Or these um\""]
["02:47,160","02:51,120","\"Are these obstacles these ghosts going around? This is the morbidly obese lady\""]
["02:51,120","02:58,120","\"Are you picking nets out of his hair?\""]
["02:58,120","02:59,120","\"Did this happen?\""]
["02:59,120","03:01,120","\"Do they have to like, I don't remember.\""]
["03:01,120","03:03,120","\"I'm trying to remember Harry Potter.\""]
["03:03,120","03:04,120","\"Did this really happen?\""]
["03:04,120","03:06,120","\"Um, yeah, I think so.\""]
["03:06,120","03:12,120","\"There's definitely like the portrait lady who, who you have to like know the password to get in.\""]
["03:12,120","03:14,120","\"Where the fuck did Hermione come from?\""]
["03:14,120","03:20,120","\"But you'd think that her being like a sentient ghost, that she would just recognize her own students and let them in.\""]
["03:20,120","03:23,560","\"No, she just said they might be the skies of Slytherin.\""]
["03:23,560","03:25,720","\"- I guess there are magic spells.\""]
["03:25,720","03:26,640","\"- Wackelberg.\""]
["03:26,640","03:28,920","\"- The password that you have to say out loud\""]
["03:28,920","03:30,800","\"is hardly like great security.\""]
["03:30,800","03:31,760","\"- That is bullshit.\""]
["03:31,760","03:33,600","\"They do not have to crawl into it like idiots.\""]
["03:33,600","03:34,520","\"- No, it's not that this is made up.\""]
["03:34,520","03:36,320","\"- That would destroy the children's backs\""]
["03:36,320","03:38,320","\"over like seven years.\""]
["03:38,320","03:40,640","\"- This is like a school dorm and they have like\""]
["03:40,640","03:41,880","\"and already-- - Fucking Zelda puzzles\""]
["03:41,880","03:43,560","\"to get to the next class.\""]
["03:43,560","03:44,400","\"- That's ridiculous.\""]
["03:44,400","03:46,200","\"- Like it makes sense when they're all like four feet tall\""]
["03:46,200","03:48,800","\"but yeah, they're here till like they're 18, right?\""]
["03:48,800","03:55,840","\"There's a that is the Mona Lisa, but slightly different that sister Mona. That's a new one actually that Mona Lisa looks good\""]
["03:55,840","04:03,280","\"Wicky did you see that little hip thing\""]
["04:03,280","04:09,120","\"Go to the door\""]
["04:09,120","04:11,680","\"Yeah, can I skip this shit\""]
["04:11,680","04:15,040","\"Another fucking password\""]
["04:15,760","04:24,000","\"That sounds like a magic spell not so much a password. That's Percy. Like the nurse's quarters. What's up with this wall?\""]
["04:24,000","04:28,280","\"That's Percy. This Ron's annoying brother than no one likes. Go deep handsome\""]
["04:28,280","04:34,800","\"Liberty jibby. Oh look another fucking room you have to crawl into by using passwords good thing. You're not fat\""]
["04:34,800","04:36,800","\"Are you gonna be able to pull yourself up like that?\""]
["04:36,800","04:44,640","\"Turns out they're not running a shop at all, but just one of my last kids\""]
["04:44,640","04:46,640","\"It's a very easy way to do it.\""]
["04:46,640","04:49,640","\"That's why there's so many passwords to make it harder to get to them.\""]
["04:49,640","04:50,640","\"You're free to browse on the states you bring.\""]
["04:50,640","04:52,640","\"Sorry! It was Liberty Jeopardy!\""]
["04:52,640","04:53,640","\"Guess you can't save the boys!\""]
["04:53,640","04:55,640","\"We're the Nazis of the school, Porta!\""]
["04:55,640","04:57,640","\"You're the Nazis of the excepted throughout Hogwarts.\""]
["04:57,640","04:58,640","\"Thirty bots, everything's...\""]
["04:58,640","04:59,640","\"Oh, you're such losers.\""]
["04:59,640","05:01,640","\"Sure, there's something here.\""]
["05:01,640","05:03,640","\"Oh, these guys made the beans?\""]
["05:03,640","05:06,640","\"No, they asked you to get them so they can sell you shit.\""]
["05:06,640","05:07,640","\"Is this the shop center?\""]
["05:07,640","05:09,640","\"This is kind of crazy, actually.\""]
["05:09,640","05:11,640","\"They're running a shop in the bathroom.\""]
["05:11,640","05:13,640","\"I'm afraid you are bean-polar.\""]
["05:13,640","05:16,640","\"Sorry guys. I'm not collecting beans for you.\""]
["05:16,640","05:18,640","\"You can- we're flicking any beans.\""]
["05:18,640","05:20,640","\"The music cut out?\""]
["05:20,640","05:22,640","\"That's not a very good fate in a nut.\""]
["05:22,640","05:25,640","\"Talk to the shop holder Gregory, whatever your fuck his name is.\""]
["05:25,640","05:27,640","\"Um, his name is Gilmore, actually.\""]

["05:32,640","05:34,640","\"*snorts*\""]
["05:34,640","05:36,640","\"*laughs*\""]
["05:36,640","05:38,640","\"I farted out my dick.\""]
["05:38,640","05:40,640","\"Is that a trough?\""]
["05:40,640","05:41,640","\"In the middle of the tree?\""]
["05:41,640","05:43,800","\"- No, it's where you watch your hands.\""]
["05:43,800","05:45,280","\"- I don't think it's a sink, but yeah,\""]

["05:59,480","06:00,400","\"- It's a trot.\""]
["06:00,400","06:01,840","\"I always called it a trot.\""]
["06:01,840","06:04,880","\"- What a good idea to set up shop inside of a trot.\""]
["06:04,880","06:07,000","\"You're in the main focus of everybody.\""]
["06:07,000","06:08,800","\"- You can piss on your goods.\""]
["06:08,800","06:10,840","\"- Yeah, you have a captive audience, that's true.\""]
["06:10,840","06:12,640","\"anytime anyone needs to shit.\""]
["06:12,640","06:14,880","\"They have to pass by your store.\""]
["06:14,880","06:15,920","\"- In the Harry Potter games.\""]
["06:15,920","06:17,600","\"- You can overcharge for toilet paper\""]
["06:17,600","06:19,320","\"and other fucking supplies.\""]
["06:19,320","06:21,040","\"- In the Harry Potter games, there's only enough room\""]
["06:21,040","06:22,720","\"for like four people usually.\""]
["06:22,720","06:24,360","\"They never think about the 300 of the students.\""]
["06:24,360","06:25,600","\"- This is cozy.\""]
["06:25,600","06:26,440","\"- Get to end your day.\""]

["07:39,440","07:45,040","\"Is there any like fucking doors around you always have to crawl through the password door?\""]
["07:45,040","07:48,800","\"A lot of these games are actually just like maneuvering the castle.\""]
["07:48,800","07:52,000","\"What couldn't be like Dark Souls where you unlock the fucking door from the side\""]
["07:52,000","07:54,240","\"and you create shortcuts instead of having to go through?\""]
["07:54,240","07:58,400","\"G-chory it's almost like it's 15 years old and they didn't think of any of that shit.\""]
