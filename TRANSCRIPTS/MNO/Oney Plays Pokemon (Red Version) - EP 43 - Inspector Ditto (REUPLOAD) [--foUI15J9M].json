["01:30,040","01:34,840","\"My god, so it last thing we did was catch a snorlax\""]
["01:34,840","01:38,160","\"Where does that leave us in the game?\""]
["01:38,160","01:41,360","\"Anyways, we're just gonna I guess do this\""]
["01:41,360","01:48,260","\"I don't know I don't remember no we couldn't know because this was the first guy that listen he just got into a fight\""]
["01:48,260","01:52,280","\"Yeah, he got into a fight so we're good. Yeah, this is the right thing. I think okay. I think we're doing it\""]
["01:52,280","01:55,280","\"Max Goof became confused.\""]
["01:55,280","01:57,280","\"Max Goof is always getting a question kill.\""]
["01:57,280","02:00,280","\"Oh, he's not a lumbersexual anymore. He's back to normal.\""]
["02:00,280","02:01,280","\"Thank God.\""]
["02:01,280","02:03,280","\"Does that mean he's confused? That sounds like he's on the right path.\""]
["02:03,280","02:06,280","\"Yeah, because it seems like the true Max Goof is lumbersexual.\""]
["02:06,280","02:11,280","\"Why do you think the guy who made that article and that account,\""]
["02:11,280","02:15,280","\"why do you think he chose to make that be Max Goof grown up,\""]
["02:15,280","02:17,280","\"as opposed to any other type of...\""]
["02:17,280","02:19,280","\"Well, the weird part is why he lived through it.\""]
["02:19,280","02:21,280","\"He definitely got horny over that film. That's the only reason.\""]
["02:21,280","02:26,500","\"Yeah, but you can get horny to other types of people you don't need to I specifically think you got horny to that\""]
["02:26,500","02:32,100","\"Because Max Goof himself turns him on and the only way he could be turned on more by Max Goof as if he was a lumbersexual\""]
["02:32,100","02:40,980","\"But like why be a lumbersexual? Why can't he be like a skinny like a skinny twink goof cuz that's I'm sure that's what that guy's into\""]
["02:40,980","02:46,820","\"Okay, but why Max goof then because he was he grew up on a goofy movie and made him horny as a little kid\""]
["02:46,820","02:50,340","\"He found out he was gay through Max Goof and he wants to be like a homosexual\""]
["02:50,340","02:55,340","\"Where do you see a lumber sexual to begin with and he's fucking horrible hipster friends at BuzzFeed?\""]
["02:55,340","02:59,700","\"I don't know why when he was a kid because he said he grew up with a goofy movie when his\""]
["02:59,700","03:05,420","\"Question is what's the yeah, where did it come from where's the connection? Maybe he had a\""]
["03:05,420","03:10,900","\"Forbidden love that was a lumberjack was there a lumber sexual who saved his life as a child?\""]
["03:10,900","03:15,060","\"Yeah, maybe a big lumber man brought him a big piece of lumber one Christmas when they're specific\""]
["03:15,060","03:20,260","\"He was trapped out in the cold all by himself your lumber sexual showed up\""]
["03:20,260","03:22,960","\"and warmed him and took him inside.\""]
["03:22,960","03:25,260","\"They made a big Tim Tam out of lumber.\""]
["03:25,260","03:27,760","\"And then they put on a goofy movie for him and said,\""]
["03:27,760","03:29,960","\"\"\"You know what? I'll forever remember this.\"\"\""]
["03:29,960","03:30,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:30,760","03:35,760","\"Isn't that where every single thing in the world stems from people being horny?\""]

["10:18,580","10:21,180","\"They had dropped Doritos onto everybody in the audience.\""]

["10:42,620","10:45,820","\"I like that it's like the weirdest out of those core.\""]
["10:45,820","10:50,420","\"There's a lot of fun scenarios with fun aesthetics for each level.\""]

["10:57,220","10:58,220","\"I do too.\""]
["10:58,220","11:02,060","\"I think instead of difficulty sliders, there should always be more branching paths, so\""]
["11:02,060","11:04,700","\"you can choose a harder path if you wish.\""]
["11:04,700","11:05,700","\"I like that too.\""]

["11:31,780","11:35,380","\"Yeah, and I'm just like this is stupid. They should just not ever do that\""]
["11:35,380","11:39,300","\"Ducky Camilla from platinum talk about this I think though\""]

["11:58,180","12:01,220","\"Which one was the one they were probably designing around?\""]

["12:01,720","12:03,620","\"Because sometimes they design around hard mode.\""]

["12:06,020","12:08,980","\"Like, it's hard to figure out how you should even pick that sometimes.\""]
["12:08,980","12:11,380","\"In Halo, it seems like Heroic is the main one.\""]

["14:24,340","14:26,440","\"The reason why that's important to me\""]
["14:26,440","14:31,540","\"is because they never showed it on TV probably because of that.\""]

["15:00,660","15:02,660","\"Why they want to kill her name though.\""]
