["06:49,560","06:54,520","\"it's cool oh my gosh I'm into the trees\""]
["06:54,520","06:58,840","\"there you go I like because I know that it's taking that into account I keep\""]
["06:58,840","07:02,880","\"worrying that you're gonna smash your head on something I think it's like\""]
["07:02,880","07:06,880","\"real life it's fair like if if you're in ragdoll mode that's when you get hurt\""]
["07:06,880","07:10,760","\"if someone punches you into ragdoll mode you get hit from the you know the\""]
["07:10,760","07:15,720","\"Blow and also the ragdoll it's cool. You can launch off other people about one move. Yeah, I love that\""]
["07:15,720","07:20,080","\"It's really fun, but what hair-raising situations are we going to get into down there Chris?\""]
["07:20,080","07:25,480","\"Hair-raising look at this. This is the best thing in the whole game. Oh\""]
["07:25,480","07:29,520","\"Jesus I made it\""]
["07:29,520","07:32,520","\"Wait, let's see. I think there's a watch guy over there. Oh\""]
["07:32,520","07:38,840","\"These are pretty colors. I like it. Yeah, no, I don't understand like the one thing\""]
["07:38,840","07:42,420","\"I don't understand people complaining about this game is the graphics. I think it looks good\""]
["07:42,420","07:47,180","\"Can you explain textures are large and the poly guns are few?\""]
["07:47,180","07:49,720","\"That's true. Can you do a frinkin style?\""]
["07:49,720","07:52,800","\"Wow, why did that kill you?\""]
["07:52,800","08:00,460","\"Extra okay, it just it was bullet time. I guess where's the other guy there is okay. I like your hands up like that. Oh, he saw me\""]
["08:00,460","08:08,480","\"A guy jumped into our camp and then he was on fire that's our fire\""]
["08:08,480","08:12,680","\"I got two in a row see that I did there. Yeah, go pick you up the arse\""]
["08:12,680","08:18,800","\"See he landed on his head there. That's what killed him. He broke his little neck. Oh my god\""]
["08:18,800","08:22,040","\"No breaking next\""]
["08:22,040","08:27,920","\"Break my neck break my neck see he's got a knife. Oh, no\""]
["08:27,920","08:30,800","\"The little stick yeah\""]
["08:30,800","08:33,880","\"Oh my god, there you go\""]
["08:33,880","08:35,880","\"Stop it. Stop it. Stop it\""]
["08:37,000","08:40,940","\"Jesus leave him alone. Hey, could you stop that? Okay?\""]
["08:40,940","08:51,600","\"So there's a few more mechanics to this game is you can wield knives and you can throw them there's a dedicated screaming button there's it\""]
["08:51,600","08:59,560","\"Little rabbit got there it is thanks. You're pretty cool. I'll see you at six flags. Okay. Oh\""]
["08:59,560","09:02,320","\"What are they gonna ride?\""]
["09:02,320","09:04,320","\"This is the ride. Yeah\""]
["09:04,600","09:10,000","\"Wait, no, it's like this. Did you just a bunch of hills? Did you used to roll down hills when you were a kid?\""]
["09:10,000","09:16,380","\"Was that a thing everybody did? Yeah, no, that's fun. Okay, it is fun. This is schizo the rat. What's his do?\""]
["09:16,380","09:17,340","\"Oh\""]
["09:17,340","09:24,220","\"Oh, boy. What does stone fist want now? We're not done surveying the damage. Well, you're stone-fisting you and why?\""]
["09:24,220","09:26,400","\"What are you?\""]
["09:26,400","09:32,200","\"What the hell? These guys are... Who just appeared? He sure did. Oh, you want to know something else that's cool?\""]
["09:32,200","09:38,720","\"Was the huh um the developer put it in the game so that you can actually make your own scenarios and type in your own dialogue and shit\""]
["09:38,720","09:45,960","\"Whoa, no kidding cool. The cool thing is is that every pose is is laid in manually. I don't know why so manually\""]
["09:45,960","09:48,200","\"but uh, so\""]
["09:48,200","09:53,120","\"There's a little bit of like jiggle bone on everything so that when the poses change from one post to another\""]
["09:53,120","09:58,280","\"It's like procedural and they didn't actually animate it, but it looks really good because of the physics itself. Oh\""]
["09:59,280","10:04,040","\"So I like that sounds very hard to do, but I am not a programmer now climb up there the green lights\""]
["10:04,040","10:07,280","\"Oh, so you got like Prince of Persia kind of shit go wow\""]
["10:07,280","10:11,120","\"Little rabbit claw marks on the walls so you know where to go yeah\""]
["10:11,120","10:13,160","\"I know and I think that's better than just making them yellow\""]
["10:13,160","10:16,000","\"Like every other fucking game. I do like that\""]
["10:16,000","10:20,960","\"I like that you can tell just by the textures like okay stuff is moving along this surface\""]
["10:20,960","10:23,800","\"Yeah, so you should probably do it too. Oh shit\""]
["10:23,800","10:26,400","\"You can see all the other rabbits clob their way up. Oh\""]
["10:27,360","10:32,800","\"I was doing so good. Let's try that again. Oh, I got to the top apparently. I guess he had a checkpoint. Yeah\""]
["10:32,800","10:35,760","\"The checkpoint seemed really lenient\""]
["10:35,760","10:43,320","\"Oh, who's this? How'd you get here? They caught me last night, but I escaped. How'd you do that? Don't worry about it\""]
["10:43,320","10:45,320","\"I'm a funny rabbit remember\""]
["10:45,320","10:47,760","\"Just like me I\""]
["10:47,760","10:50,800","\"Jumped very high and my ears were really big\""]
["10:50,800","10:56,560","\"Oops, you're gonna like this part Julian. Are there ghosts better\""]
["10:56,720","10:58,720","\"Do a flopsy a\""]
["10:58,720","11:01,960","\"Oh my gosh wait no not that\""]
["11:01,960","11:07,240","\"Life he continues to live this building is cool. After such daring big it is\""]
["11:07,240","11:09,360","\"Life finds a way\""]
["11:09,360","11:14,960","\"See all the rabbits are little slaves being controlled by you kick these over that would be actually really cool, but no\""]
["11:14,960","11:25,120","\"Oh no rabbit, it's block man. Is that literal block man or is that a guy with the thing?\""]
["11:25,120","11:30,640","\"That's a worker. I think it would be fun. He's the resident block man. It'd be cool\""]
["11:30,640","11:35,860","\"If there is there's I mean there's animals like what else is there? I don't know shit watch this\""]
["11:35,860","11:39,040","\"I have only just been introduced to this world. Oh shit. Oh\""]
["11:39,040","11:47,800","\"Just happened if there's one thing I wish they would change about throwing stuff is that I wish they let you aim at yourself\""]
["11:47,800","11:50,040","\"It just automatically goes to where they're walking\""]
["11:53,640","11:57,080","\"You would hit them though if you had a aim manually it seems like it'd be really hard.\""]
["11:57,080","11:58,080","\"I never had a chance.\""]
["11:58,080","12:01,160","\"That's just a little more skill I would be willing to learn, you know?\""]
