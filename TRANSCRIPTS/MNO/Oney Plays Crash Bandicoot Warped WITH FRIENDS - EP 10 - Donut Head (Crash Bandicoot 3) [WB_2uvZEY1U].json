["00:08,300","00:09,300","\"*Ding*\""]
["00:09,300","00:10,500","\"\"\"With Friends\"\"\""]
["00:10,500","00:15,500","\"And the future level, there's lab levels in the other two games that are just like that anyways.\""]
["00:15,500","00:16,200","\"*Ding* Yeah!\""]
["00:16,200","00:18,800","\"I'd say the dinosaur stage is probably the...\""]
["00:18,800","00:22,900","\"then the medieval setting, but even then the medieval setting you could try to...\""]
["00:22,900","00:27,000","\"make something of it like, \"\"Oh well, it's just a- it's a Renaissance fare and there's goofballs.\"\"\""]
["00:27,000","00:27,900","\"You could- you could make-\""]
["00:27,900","00:30,340","\"The whole thing is a movie set. That's true\""]
["00:30,340","00:37,900","\"It's easy to come up with that. I would say I'd say the medieval setting and the dinosaur ones are the the clear-cut examples of time travel\""]
["00:37,900","00:41,140","\"It doesn't seem like they go too far out there with a lot of these\""]
["00:41,140","00:44,180","\"This is just Arabia\""]
["00:44,180","00:49,780","\"Because the the Roman Colosseum one with a with tiny stuff like that if they just did more of that\""]
["00:49,780","00:52,460","\"Why is he the only boss that's dressed up? I don't know\""]
["00:52,460","00:56,040","\"Because they introduced new characters and they need to give them you\""]
["00:56,460","01:00,260","\"Maybe they had a different idea to begin with and then they just changed it to time travel.\""]
["01:00,260","01:04,980","\"Well the Japanese title screen just shows the earth so it makes it look like it is just a world tour game.\""]
["01:04,980","01:06,300","\"Oh really?\""]
["01:06,300","01:06,800","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:06,800","01:09,980","\"Yeah he does the dance on a title screen.\""]
["01:09,980","01:11,300","\"He says...\""]
["01:11,300","01:12,300","\"*screams*\""]
["01:12,300","01:14,740","\"How's the japs say?\""]
["01:14,740","01:16,600","\"You can't say that Chris.\""]
["01:16,600","01:17,580","\"Can't say japs?\""]
["01:17,580","01:18,080","\"No.\""]
["01:18,080","01:18,900","\"Silly.\""]
["01:18,900","01:24,820","\"Did you see there's a movement now in the emulation community that any ROM that has jap at the end of it?\""]
["01:25,060","01:27,660","\"They're demanding that you change it. That's really funny.\""]
["01:27,660","01:32,100","\"It's the Japanese version. That's why they shortened it to that.\""]
["01:32,100","01:34,060","\"They're fucking insane.\""]
["01:34,060","01:37,500","\"Can we can we start saying \"\"ing\"\" as a slur then?\""]
["01:37,500","01:42,460","\"An \"\"ir\"\". You fucking fr-\""]
["01:42,460","01:46,060","\"American? Don't call me an \"\"emerk\"\". You gur.\""]

["02:01,260","02:09,980","\"You still you still might fall here I would never\""]
["02:09,980","02:16,700","\"Good job Chris thanks. I do like the spin ability in the air. I think that's a fun one. It's cool\""]
["02:16,700","02:20,640","\"I'm surprised I didn't put it in the first one. It still makes it easier. No natural. I\""]
["02:21,700","02:29,180","\"It's a timing span for enemies is like a like if it's the thing it makes older stages easier a lot of the later stages are\""]
["02:29,180","02:33,100","\"Designed around it though like you had to use it there. Yeah. Yeah, see\""]
["02:33,100","02:37,500","\"Well, wait, what am I going?\""]
["02:37,500","02:50,420","\"Are you going to the left here? Yes, you are. Yeah, that's a good you don't have to do secret again, right?\""]

["02:56,540","03:00,780","\"Here he goes over the horizon. Would you ever tell somebody to monk off?\""]
["03:00,780","03:10,560","\"I thought that was a box in the distance. They remember that's the thing. That's why it's spinning. Yeah, it's a real box. See\""]
["03:10,560","03:13,780","\"Look what daddy got\""]
["03:17,340","03:22,160","\"Every time every time you get to the end of the stage with all the boxes broken\""]
["03:22,160","03:28,380","\"It obliterates a small universe of peaceful creatures somebody mod is game. So it's Julian instead of\""]
["03:28,380","03:35,040","\"They become they become crystallized their life force turns into the gem and you hear their screams\""]
["03:35,040","03:37,800","\"The screams is a creepy pass to the no. Oh\""]
["03:37,800","03:40,000","\"This is fact\""]
["03:40,000","03:41,200","\"- Like, like, \"\"Bendy\"\"?\""]
["03:41,200","03:43,640","\"- Oh, and Karsh Bandicoot looked like a real Bandicoot,\""]
["03:43,640","03:47,120","\"except he was standing up and looked like a cartoon Bandicoot,\""]
["03:47,120","03:49,640","\"but he was realistic, and his eyes were bleeding.\""]
["03:49,640","03:51,480","\"- Why do we talk about creepy pasta songs?\""]
["03:51,480","03:53,520","\"- It's funny, because they're easy to make fun of,\""]
["03:53,520","03:54,680","\"because it has stupid words.\""]
["03:54,680","03:56,520","\"- I remember I feel so embarrassed now,\""]
["03:56,520","03:57,640","\"because I used to--\""]
["03:57,640","03:58,560","\"- Oh, fuck.\""]
["03:58,560","03:59,400","\"- Jesus.\""]
["03:59,400","04:01,640","\"- Like, 10 years ago, I used to add--\""]
["04:01,640","04:02,960","\"- I would like a restart.\""]
["04:02,960","04:05,600","\"- I used to be like, my friends would be like,\""]
["04:05,600","04:07,600","\"what are you doing reading these creepy pastas,\""]
["04:07,600","04:08,720","\"and I would be like,\""]
["04:08,720","04:11,120","\"No, they're actually really spooky. I think they're cool.\""]
["04:11,120","04:14,320","\"And this one's about Mario, but he's dead.\""]
["04:14,320","04:19,520","\"As time went on and they became more mainstream, they would like just it just got filled with garbage.\""]
["04:19,520","04:24,220","\"And now now if you say creepy pasta, you likely mean oh, some shitty video game thing.\""]
["04:24,220","04:27,020","\"I think they're happy.\""]
["04:27,020","04:36,020","\"There's like fucking 11 billion YouTube channels where they read where they read bad creepy pastas\""]
["04:36,020","04:39,820","\"in their shitty British voices that sound really bored.\""]
["04:39,820","04:44,060","\"- The thing, when I used to listen to those two, Julian,\""]
["04:44,060","04:45,740","\"they always had shitty microphones\""]
["04:45,740","04:47,340","\"and shitty voices for reading it.\""]
["04:47,340","04:48,700","\"- Yeah, 'cause it's scarier.\""]
["04:48,700","04:51,260","\"- They don't even, it's fucking bizarre.\""]
["04:51,260","04:53,780","\"They don't even try to put on an affect or anything.\""]
["04:53,780","04:54,900","\"- Yeah, no, they're just like,\""]
["04:54,900","04:56,380","\"they always sound like little kids are like,\""]
["04:56,380","04:58,180","\"- And then, he went to this.\""]
["04:58,180","05:02,100","\"- They took the stairs even though it was very dark.\""]
["05:02,100","05:03,060","\"- Yeah, they don't even try.\""]
["05:03,060","05:05,260","\"- My favorite is when it's documented,\""]
["05:05,260","05:09,400","\"like it's a I woke up this morning. Hi, diary. You're\""]
["05:09,400","05:13,820","\"pretty much a motion into it. Yeah, I woke up this morning.\""]
["05:13,820","05:18,200","\"And I went to the game I bought for the garage. I got\""]
["05:18,200","05:22,660","\"barrio. And I feel like a losing Saturday. I'm going to kill\""]
["05:22,660","05:26,460","\"myself. And then the final chapter says he killed himself.\""]
["05:26,460","05:31,600","\"And it was funny. And these are real records documented from\""]
["05:31,600","05:34,480","\"his laptop because I was his best friend. And as soon as he\""]
["05:34,480","05:40,400","\"died I took his laptop to upload these. But then the spooky things starts happening to them.\""]
["05:40,400","05:47,120","\"And then they get haunted by Mario.exe. Yeah. Because when something's an application on\""]
["05:47,120","05:55,200","\"a computer, it's scary. I relate to Photoshop.exe. I use... I use the XCs.\""]
["05:55,200","05:58,920","\"Oh, wait a minute. No\""]
["05:58,920","06:06,780","\"These are my friends. It could happen to you. Oh, you know what I challenge. I don't think I've ever I challenge you 20\""]

["06:12,240","06:15,380","\"You're right it is a trip that was such bullshit\""]
["06:15,380","06:21,720","\"I challenge somebody to write a creepy pasta about Photoshop in stupid game or or some other program\""]
["06:21,720","06:27,340","\"That's clearly not it was a photo of me on the screen and it kept liquefying it and it made my eyes too big\""]
["06:27,340","06:32,960","\"It wasn't big and suddenly I started getting millions of views and then my eyes are real life were too big\""]
["06:32,960","06:38,820","\"Bugs kept flying into them. It'd be on the bottom. I hate it\""]
["06:38,820","06:44,020","\"What if the story was just all the practical problems that you'd run into there's that one guy who took the photo like\""]
["06:44,020","06:47,620","\"Oh, I just got cool piercings and he put the holes on the sides of his mouth\""]
["06:47,760","06:53,000","\"By hit the idea that cuz I mean there's just gaping holes always here and things are gonna be getting into them all the time\""]
["06:53,000","06:55,000","\"Yeah, that guy's an idiot\""]
["06:55,000","07:01,200","\"Did you see when people are doing the donut head thing yeah, they wouldn't fight the top of their head it's just\""]

["08:58,500","09:03,200","\"You get it a big part of it. It's also just kind of memorizing it. This is completely memorizing it\""]
["09:03,200","09:06,360","\"It's uh\""]
["09:06,360","09:10,760","\"That's like when people talk about it collect the fun games like banjo kazooing\""]
["09:10,760","09:14,840","\"They see your bad at it. Well the skill level comes from you just knowing where things are in it\""]
["09:14,840","09:19,360","\"Yeah, that's all it is. That's what dark souls kind of is - it's knowing where to go and stuff\""]
["09:19,360","09:24,300","\"Rammy mister, but you know, it's nice about Mario 64 everything and it's very straightforward\""]

["09:54,360","09:56,880","\"They have some really\""]

["10:03,000","10:06,560","\"When it's a thing required for like a hundred percent it should not be\""]
["10:06,560","10:09,440","\"something like\""]
["10:09,440","10:14,520","\"Like you would you need to drop a hint of some sort a can 120% or something\""]
["10:14,520","10:20,040","\"Well, even then I would say it can't be cryptic to the point that you don't even drop a hint about it\""]
