["10:56,280","11:07,860","\"I think it just it depends on finding nice people. That's apps. That's all it is. I've said that a couple times, man.\""]
["11:07,860","11:14,680","\"That is literally all it is, man. Yeah, you're more likely to run into a shithead here than most places though.\""]

["11:51,220","11:59,360","\"That stereotype is real in the sense that you will find those people, but I do feel like there's like this\""]
["11:59,360","12:07,720","\"Widely held belief that that's like everybody here. Yeah, and I really just think it's the kind of person you run into if\""]
