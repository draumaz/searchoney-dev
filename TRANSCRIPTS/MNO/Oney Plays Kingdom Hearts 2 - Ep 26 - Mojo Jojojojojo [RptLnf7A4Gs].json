["00:16,820","00:18,460","\"That's the opposite of staming still.\""]
["00:18,460","00:20,860","\"There was a legend in Wexford who did that,\""]
["00:20,860","00:24,260","\"and he did it for so long he turned into a real statue.\""]
["00:24,260","00:25,300","\"He oxidized.\""]
["00:25,300","00:27,260","\"[laughter]\""]

["00:31,940","00:32,940","\"Good.\""]
["00:32,940","00:34,940","\"It's a brand new day.\""]
["00:34,940","00:38,940","\"I'm definitely allergic to everything around me right now.\""]
["00:38,940","00:44,940","\"There's little cute animals running around and they always make ding dong feel no good.\""]

["01:26,420","01:28,420","\"We can team up!\""]
["01:28,420","01:30,420","\"Just because of our arriving names!\""]
["01:30,420","01:34,420","\"That's a very arbitrary reason to join forces.\""]
["01:34,420","01:37,420","\"So, okay, if your name was like Timley Winks,\""]
["01:37,420","01:39,420","\"and you met a guy called Jimley Winks,\""]
["01:39,420","01:41,420","\"you wouldn't instantly become friends?\""]
["01:41,420","01:43,420","\"No, I'd probably say to him.\""]

["01:57,420","02:01,420","\"I don't know. I don't get what the implication was supposed to be. Why does he vibrate around with those?\""]
["02:01,420","02:07,420","\"That they... That they... because they jump up on the sword sometimes and they like\""]
["02:07,420","02:13,420","\"hang in the air. So I guess it's supposed to like imply that like he's not affected by gravity.\""]
["02:13,420","02:17,420","\"Are you able to block each of those hits? These ones?\""]
["02:17,420","02:19,420","\"Yeah, maybe if I had\""]
["02:19,420","02:25,580","\"If I had the shield spell on I haven't bothered equipping it yet\""]
["02:25,580","02:32,180","\"Did you know that gravity is just a big misunderstanding that is everybody got really confused they're supposed to fall up\""]
["02:32,180","02:36,400","\"But collectively humanity is a species decided to go down instead\""]
["02:36,400","02:43,680","\"Impressive every day we we commit this crime against nature. Who is this truly a black nose?\""]

["03:08,060","03:09,860","\"- You hit somebody once with it in a brain.\""]
["03:09,860","03:12,940","\"- It's not made up clay, it's made up of the trio of magic.\""]
["03:12,940","03:14,580","\"- It'd be really dirty near the end of it.\""]
["03:14,580","03:16,980","\"I used to make stuff out of model magic when I was a kid.\""]
