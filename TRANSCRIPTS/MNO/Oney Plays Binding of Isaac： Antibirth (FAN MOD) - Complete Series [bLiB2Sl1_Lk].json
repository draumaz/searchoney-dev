["08:09,900","08:14,300","\"And then when I finally saw the movie when I was like 16, it was really underwhelming.\""]
["08:14,300","08:16,900","\"'Cause I had built it up since I was like 6.\""]
["08:16,900","08:18,000","\"And then...\""]

["51:13,680","51:19,880","\"Yeah as villains like that where like you get sort of punished for taking too long in a dungeon and then oh\""]
["51:19,880","51:24,540","\"Like this like super powerful enemy will show up, but only after a certain amount of time\""]
["51:24,540","51:29,720","\"Wow, so if it was done in a way like that then speedrunners would never have to worry about it\""]
["51:29,720","51:33,760","\"Gotcha just a thought but it's also oh, that's a good point\""]
["51:33,760","51:39,360","\"Yeah, I guess there's a few ways you can kind of make it fun and fair. Hey, Tim. Are you pretty smart?\""]
["51:39,360","51:43,120","\"What's your smart score\""]
["51:43,120","51:44,720","\"How many smarts do you have?\""]
["51:44,720","51:45,520","\"I have one.\""]
["51:45,520","51:49,720","\"Another way to do it is, if you just leave them standing still for a while,\""]
["51:49,720","51:52,520","\"big uncircumstital show up and fuck you up.\""]
["51:52,520","51:57,120","\"Like, I liked it in Final Fantasy VII when you could see those, like, weapons roaming the earth,\""]
["51:57,120","51:58,920","\"like that. That made them really cool.\""]
["51:58,920","51:59,520","\"Yeah.\""]

["52:53,360","53:02,960","\"No, that's actually the thing that's actually the reason why I avoided Jojo for like years\""]
["53:02,960","53:06,480","\"Because I was getting annoyed at how much other people liked it\""]
["53:06,480","53:07,000","\"Yeah\""]
["53:07,000","53:10,780","\"I think like a lot of people are turned off by that because of that very reason\""]
["53:10,780","53:16,680","\"Which is why I try not to recommend it to people because if I don't try to give it some to watch a little better chance\""]
["53:16,680","53:19,320","\"They'll watch a little reverse psychology there. Yeah, yeah\""]
["53:19,320","53:23,180","\"That's the old Tomar trick. So you got married, right?\""]

["55:13,840","55:21,200","\"hmm wait what was I gonna say about that oh yeah I don't like that the default way of marrying someone\""]
["55:21,200","55:24,640","\"makes it so that you can easily fuck yourself out of half your shit\""]
["55:24,640","55:31,160","\"well actually in California I don't know getting it really everywhere in a lot of states\""]
["55:31,160","55:34,340","\"Like that, you have to sign a prenup thing.\""]
["55:34,340","55:36,980","\"That should be default, that should just be part of it.\""]
["55:36,980","55:40,180","\"It should be default so that that happens\""]

["55:47,780","55:50,780","\"- It does kind of throw a weird wrench into the whole thing.\""]
["55:50,780","55:53,060","\"Like at the very outset, it's kind of like\""]
["55:53,060","55:55,220","\"you guys gotta discuss all this money shit.\""]

["55:56,900","55:58,100","\"- It really makes you wonder.\""]
["55:58,100","55:59,060","\"- Makes you wonder.\""]
["55:59,060","56:04,480","\"If I ever do get married, I'm gonna say listen you want half my money?\""]
["56:04,480","56:09,220","\"Fine take it. I don't need it really and that's because no\""]

["56:13,740","56:15,740","\"It's I\""]
["56:15,740","56:20,080","\"Don't know you should if they ever ask anything about money\""]

["56:42,020","56:44,840","\"Yeah, but if they die you get it back. Oh\""]
["56:44,840","56:51,800","\"So that's fine. So just be careful, you know, just watch your back if you're thinking you can just\""]
["56:52,380","56:55,300","\"stroll into my life and snag my wallet and this,\""]
["56:55,300","56:56,140","\"my sleep.\""]

["57:06,860","57:10,860","\"Like, you're agreeing to basically a,\""]
["57:10,860","57:12,220","\"like it's a separate marriage.\""]
["57:12,220","57:13,860","\"- You're also the lifelong commitment.\""]
["57:13,860","57:14,700","\"- That's right.\""]
["57:14,700","57:15,980","\"- To give them a motive to kill you.\""]

["57:20,020","57:23,980","\"Look, if you're greedy, maybe, but otherwise, no.\""]
["57:23,980","57:25,180","\"It's like, hey, we didn't work out.\""]

["59:38,340","59:39,180","\"- Yeah.\""]
["59:39,180","59:40,380","\"- If you're renting your whole life,\""]

["59:51,940","59:53,380","\"It's gotta be.\""]
["59:53,380","59:54,900","\"But the thing is you never had to deal\""]

["59:56,580","59:57,420","\"- That's true.\""]
["59:57,420","59:59,420","\"Yep, and your paying taxes on property.\""]

["01:00:01,700","01:00:02,620","\"is more than rent.\""]
["01:00:02,620","01:00:04,460","\"- I was talking about it winning at house.\""]
["01:00:04,460","01:00:08,180","\"- It says it's not really equity and like it is,\""]
["01:00:08,180","01:00:11,480","\"But if it's a house you're living in,\""]
["01:00:11,480","01:00:14,700","\"it's not really worth anything to you\""]

["01:00:20,060","01:00:22,780","\"- Yeah, but then you got to either get out.\""]
["01:00:22,780","01:00:23,600","\"That's the point. - Get out.\""]

["01:00:24,420","01:00:27,140","\"- That's the point, like you own a house,\""]
["01:00:27,140","01:00:28,860","\"but you only really make money.\""]
["01:00:28,860","01:00:30,860","\"The investment, a good investment,\""]

["01:00:33,660","01:00:37,740","\"- Like something that actually is actively making you money\""]

["01:00:39,660","01:00:41,300","\"- That's true.\""]
["01:00:41,300","01:00:44,620","\"What the best thing you could do\""]

["01:00:53,340","01:00:55,660","\"- Which supports the idea that the rich get richer\""]
["01:00:55,660","01:00:57,580","\"'cause only the rich people have the capital\""]
