["03:02,080","03:03,180","\"What happened?\""]
["03:03,180","03:06,080","\"- Besides the fact that you got a loot crate,\""]
["03:06,080","03:07,600","\"you loved all the kinds of stuff.\""]

["03:08,440","03:12,140","\"- Well they, um, they fucking offered me a deal\""]
["03:12,140","03:14,300","\"to do loot crates.\""]
["03:14,300","03:18,080","\"And I was like, I'm not exactly the kind of figure\""]

["03:21,440","03:25,540","\"So I'm like, can I make a fucking like sponsored video\""]
["03:25,540","03:28,920","\"that's just like generally making fun of loot crate videos?\""]
["03:28,920","03:30,360","\"And they were like, yeah, do it.\""]
["03:30,360","03:32,600","\"And that was pretty cool of them initially.\""]
["03:32,600","03:35,520","\"So I made one and it was pretty funny actually.\""]
["03:35,520","03:38,040","\"It's actually one of my favorite videos that I made.\""]
["03:38,040","03:40,240","\"Then I made a second one and then\""]
["03:40,240","03:42,000","\"when I went to make the third one,\""]
["03:42,000","03:44,760","\"I looked at the comments for the second one\""]
["03:44,760","03:46,920","\"'cause I had to recreate a shot from it\""]
["03:46,920","03:48,320","\"and I saw in the comments,\""]
["03:48,320","03:50,680","\"\"\"Hey, my code isn't working for Loot Crate.\"\"\""]
["03:50,680","03:53,400","\"And they basically canceled without telling me.\""]
["03:53,400","03:57,120","\"And I was like almost all the way through the video.\""]
["03:57,120","04:00,640","\"So I had one joke that was a little bit too far\""]
["04:00,640","04:02,040","\"that I was thinking of cutting out\""]
["04:02,040","04:04,000","\"that I hadn't filmed yet.\""]

["04:05,840","04:08,000","\"like that I wasn't gonna get paid for it\""]
["04:08,000","04:09,360","\"after I had made it.\""]
