["02:27,500","02:32,340","\"And then that generation will come to pass reset\""]
["02:32,340","02:38,960","\"Everything is cyclical also. It's also people go see his warnings on it now. That's true\""]
["02:38,960","02:44,060","\"What go to go to you actually ruins you before it shows anything really that's not that's not the point\""]

["04:58,180","05:08,260","\"You do that was pretty good\""]
["05:08,260","05:12,140","\"This is when you have to launch the things in space. Oh\""]
["05:12,140","05:17,500","\"We can do the sandbird. I can actually do that one go. Oh, yes gets in the sample bar. I\""]
["05:17,500","05:22,260","\"Love I like the weird the weird wigglers I have in this game\""]
["05:23,500","05:28,160","\"They look so happy it's asleep the ducks are my favorite that I like those a lot\""]
["05:28,160","05:34,160","\"You know why Japanese characters are always dripping snob why why because it's considered\""]
["05:34,160","05:38,520","\"Rude over there to blow your nose so everyone sucks their boogers in and swallows\""]
["05:38,520","05:41,440","\"They're not I can't blow my nose\""]
["05:41,440","05:49,960","\"Really like you're just incapable it just it's the most uncomfortable like it's so uncomfortable it hurts sucking it down and swallowing it\""]
["05:49,960","05:54,440","\"I think it's more uncomfortable. It's gross, but I just something I don't know what it is\""]
["05:54,440","06:04,640","\"Anatomy of my nose fucking hurts. Oh, thank you very much when I shove a you know those things that you shave the inside of your nose with\""]
["06:04,640","06:08,220","\"That's that's some of the most like extreme discomfort\""]
["06:08,220","06:14,240","\"I can think of I mean I feel for anything like even when I like pick my nose around the way I start crying instantly\""]
["06:14,240","06:19,680","\"Oh my god, I've got really fucked up sinuses or something. I've always had weird pain from it\""]
["06:19,680","06:22,760","\"Do like a shark Chris don't want to stop you to punch in the nose\""]
["06:22,760","06:29,200","\"But he has the fire his fire powers\""]
["06:29,200","06:34,200","\"That's true that reflection looks really good. Yeah, I'm surprised it's not lagging the game out of all\""]
["06:34,200","06:37,280","\"Yeah, how do they do that the title is really good a compression?\""]
["06:37,280","06:43,080","\"I mean you can see how it looks how it's I mean, yeah, but it still looks great. We freaking yeah\""]
["06:43,080","06:46,080","\"It's what they do\""]
["06:46,080","06:51,360","\"and dreams of melee how it's a lower resolution version. It's why when people try to play that\""]
["06:51,360","06:55,520","\"emulate it, they turn off a lot of the effects on that stage. Oh my god, it's such a good idea.\""]
["06:55,520","07:00,400","\"You're not like melee players getting like TVs from airports because it has zero input lag.\""]
["07:00,400","07:00,800","\"Really?\""]
["07:00,800","07:04,720","\"Melee? Melee players are the craziest freaks in the world.\""]
["07:04,720","07:13,440","\"I... yes. They designed a very tight game. I know that it's a very popular activity.\""]
["07:14,640","07:15,840","\"He's dead.\""]
["07:15,840","07:17,840","\"Oh yeah, he fucking just fell apart.\""]
["07:17,840","07:19,200","\"He had no skeleton structure.\""]
["07:19,200","07:20,480","\"He's actually made a stand.\""]
["07:20,480","07:21,280","\"Do PS/T's?\""]
["07:21,280","07:22,760","\"Fucks don't have skeletons, I mean.\""]
["07:22,760","07:23,280","\"That's true.\""]
["07:23,280","07:24,800","\"They have exoskeletunes.\""]
["07:24,800","07:26,560","\"Do PS/T's three little cats?\""]
["07:26,560","07:27,240","\"Fours have--\""]
["07:27,240","07:28,800","\"They just squish piles.\""]
["07:28,800","07:29,720","\"Oh, OK, that's good.\""]
["07:29,720","07:31,520","\"Do we still have Regenlock and consoles?\""]
["07:31,520","07:32,960","\"That's the scientific name for it.\""]
["07:32,960","07:34,200","\"Yeah, squish, stuff.\""]
["07:34,200","07:36,520","\"I like the Regenlock, yeah.\""]
["07:36,520","07:38,080","\"I was going to say, Ding Dong.\""]
["07:38,080","07:39,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:39,480","07:41,360","\"You know Shadow of the Colossus?\""]
["07:41,360","07:41,840","\"Yes.\""]
["07:41,840","07:44,480","\"If the Colossus was shrunk down to the player's size,\""]
["07:44,480","07:47,840","\"Would it still use just as much memory?\""]
["07:47,840","07:49,200","\"I would assume so, right?\""]
["07:49,200","07:49,840","\"Yeah, probably.\""]
["07:49,840","07:51,560","\"Because it still needs as many assets.\""]
["07:51,560","07:52,480","\"Right, so making--\""]
["07:52,480","07:54,880","\"Making de-rendering parts of it, which I don't think it does.\""]
["07:54,880","07:59,680","\"So making a character on screen gigantic\""]
["07:59,680","08:01,600","\"doesn't take up more resources, right?\""]
["08:01,600","08:02,160","\"Wow.\""]
["08:02,160","08:03,880","\"So why don't more games do that?\""]
["08:03,880","08:06,080","\"Well, you can't fall out of like the best of games,\""]
["08:06,080","08:08,080","\"which means you character size to like the size of the game.\""]
["08:08,080","08:09,520","\"Because when a character's also bigger,\""]
["08:09,520","08:12,680","\"that means that you're seeing imperfections on a model\""]
["08:12,680","08:13,320","\"more clearly.\""]
["08:13,320","08:16,920","\"Right, but it's so cool. It's cool to see something huge and scary.\""]
["08:16,920","08:17,760","\"Oh, you mean that?\""]
["08:17,760","08:18,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:18,760","08:19,760","\"There.\""]
["08:19,760","08:20,760","\"That's close.\""]
["08:20,760","08:21,760","\"Oh, my God.\""]
["08:21,760","08:23,960","\"I like Shadowhead Truck just for the opening.\""]
["08:23,960","08:24,800","\"It's one of my favorites.\""]
["08:24,800","08:27,760","\"That's what got me to like garbage rock.\""]
["08:27,760","08:29,760","\"It's one of my favorites.\""]
["08:29,760","08:32,560","\"Do you like that the president has a photo of Shadow and Sonic?\""]
["08:32,560","08:33,560","\"I'm a dad.\""]
["08:33,560","08:34,560","\"He does, yeah.\""]
["08:34,560","08:36,560","\"So he takes that with him to bed?\""]
["08:36,560","08:39,400","\"It's like only you two can keep me alive.\""]
["08:39,400","08:41,400","\"Is it on Trump's desk right now?\""]
["08:41,400","08:47,180","\"Hey you two we've been captured by Eggman and you're the only two that can say this\""]
["08:47,180","08:53,780","\"Let's go sonic take this ring. Oh, yeah, it goes. Let's show shadow. It goes shadow. Let's go\""]
["08:53,780","08:56,980","\"Yeah\""]
["08:56,980","09:01,220","\"Oh, but have you ever seen a hedgehog dance?\""]
["09:04,700","09:11,020","\"He doesn't say dance. He says do this. I don't remember. No, he goes oh but dude they dang\""]
["09:11,020","09:15,300","\"That's what it was ready for the funnest level here. It is I\""]
["09:15,300","09:20,540","\"Don't know. I don't remember if I ever beat this when I had this game is this famous?\""]
["09:20,540","09:25,320","\"Yeah, like people like he flips around like when you get almost the top the thing\""]
["09:25,320","09:28,300","\"It's such a nice looking like it's a cool idea\""]
["09:28,300","09:34,140","\"This is also like if you try to hundred percent this game is the worst level because blue coins just are gone for a long time\""]
["09:34,140","09:35,340","\"Hey, if you lost one.\""]
["09:35,340","09:36,980","\"Hey, hey, hey.\""]
["09:36,980","09:39,680","\"Chris, you don't like your new games?\""]
["09:39,680","09:40,820","\"I'm jaded.\""]
["09:40,820","09:42,620","\"You're jaded, Smith.\""]
["09:42,620","09:44,820","\"Can't wait for his anime to do.\""]
["09:44,820","09:45,500","\"Is that real?\""]
["09:45,500","09:48,060","\"Yeah, it's real. It's called a neon notebook.\""]
["09:48,060","09:49,700","\"Yeah. What the fuck?\""]
["09:49,700","09:52,860","\"Yes, that is real. They're doing it for Netflix.\""]
["09:52,860","09:55,700","\"Remember, Jaden Smith was tweeting at Spirit Science?\""]
["09:55,700","09:57,580","\"Like, dude, I need to talk to you.\""]
["09:57,580","09:58,580","\"This is really--\""]
["09:58,580","10:00,060","\"How do I sneak into a hospital?\""]
["10:00,060","10:03,460","\"How do I infect the patients?\""]
["10:03,460","10:06,640","\"I need to save them from themselves\""]
["10:06,640","10:10,740","\"Oh, oh, how do I cure them with positive emotions?\""]
["10:10,740","10:19,540","\"There's no inertia when you jump you just fly backwards. Yeah, this music's very peaceful exactly. It's like it's calming to death\""]
