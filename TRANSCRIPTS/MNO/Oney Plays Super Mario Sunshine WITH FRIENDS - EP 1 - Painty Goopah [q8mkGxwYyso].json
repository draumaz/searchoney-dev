["00:39,700","00:44,420","\"fucking brain dead and like they have no human thoughts.\""]
["00:44,420","00:46,700","\"This is always the game that I think of\""]
["00:46,700","00:48,420","\"'cause you get shots like this.\""]
["00:48,420","00:49,260","\"- Yeah.\""]
["00:49,260","00:51,420","\"- Where she's just staring for like 30 minutes\""]
["00:51,420","00:53,400","\"before she can even say a single word.\""]
["00:53,400","00:56,660","\"- Oh.\""]
["00:56,660","00:58,420","\"- This truly is a cinematic experience.\""]

["01:00,420","01:06,580","\"She's in heat yeah, can you tell with how?\""]
["01:06,580","01:12,780","\"Overly saturated this game is it's very hot out. I meant like sexual heat\""]
["01:12,780","01:18,180","\"She plays a star wars I love Star Wars\""]

["01:32,260","01:40,240","\"Yeah, okay, it's pretty close to Mario 64 you're making a huge mess Julian do we have the long\""]
["01:40,240","01:45,560","\"Mario\""]
["01:45,560","01:48,340","\"Mario\""]
["01:48,340","01:51,060","\"Fucking guys at the end\""]
["01:51,060","01:53,500","\"Why is everything cell shaded in this?\""]
["01:53,500","01:58,260","\"This is like a cartoon.\""]
["01:58,260","01:59,580","\"You know, I never beat this game.\""]
["01:59,580","02:01,380","\"Look, there's Mario 64 in the corner.\""]
["02:01,380","02:02,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:02,380","02:05,020","\"She remembers.\""]
["02:05,020","02:05,740","\"Is it a she?\""]
["02:05,740","02:06,780","\"I call it a she.\""]
["02:06,780","02:08,220","\"It looks like it sounds like a lady's voice to me.\""]
["02:08,220","02:09,540","\"Sounds like a girl, yeah.\""]
["02:09,540","02:11,020","\"I apologize for misgendering her.\""]
["02:11,020","02:12,420","\"It's a robo-boo.\""]
["02:12,420","02:15,020","\"They have no gender.\""]
["02:15,020","02:18,100","\"Do not misgender be.\""]
["02:18,100","02:18,580","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["02:18,580","02:19,740","\"I want to hear that in the voice.\""]
["02:23,140","02:26,520","\"Do you like how long this opening takes Chris?\""]
["02:26,520","02:27,360","\"- It's pretty good.\""]
["02:27,360","02:30,420","\"- You have to watch him sit in the jail cell for 45 minutes.\""]
["02:30,420","02:32,900","\"(laughs)\""]
["02:32,900","02:34,500","\"You have to wait out your sentence.\""]
["02:34,500","02:36,900","\"- Why is he squirting?\""]
["02:36,900","02:40,380","\"- Wouldn't you squirt Chris?\""]
["02:40,380","02:41,980","\"- I guess.\""]
["02:41,980","02:44,860","\"- I really wish that the flood got utilized more in this game\""]
["02:44,860","02:48,660","\"and that it was less about like the,\""]
["02:48,660","02:51,780","\"I know we disagree, me and DingDong disagree on\""]
["02:52,740","02:57,800","\"Mario Sunshine he really likes the he really likes the the secret stages where you jump around on the blocks\""]
["02:57,800","03:04,020","\"No, I like those two I like when he I like when he floats around on the on the flood and it's fun\""]
["03:04,020","03:07,860","\"I think I was there was more squirting at things as we're well\""]
["03:07,860","03:12,260","\"I think my cleaning is the less the the least fun part. I\""]
["03:12,260","03:18,180","\"Enjoy the movement options that's fair. I think all the movement options really fun with the flood\""]
["03:18,180","03:20,420","\"I just like having excuses to play with goop\""]
["03:21,140","03:24,740","\"That's fair. That's true. He plays in the mud all the time\""]
["03:24,740","03:31,540","\"Do you guys want to have a heated debate on who's right and who's not right? Who was wrong?\""]
["03:31,540","03:33,540","\"Haha, I think\""]
["03:33,540","03:35,980","\"this game fucking gay\""]
["03:35,980","03:38,500","\"Or something mean I\""]
["03:38,500","03:44,620","\"Think he's stinks who you? I'm not in the game\""]
["03:47,260","03:53,640","\"This is a shitty debate. It's debate on about something that really matters. Okay, which do you like better pink or orange?\""]
["03:53,640","03:58,800","\"I like them both together. I do too. That wasn't a debate was it?\""]
["03:58,800","04:04,160","\"Like I really like the color combinations they choose for the goop\""]
["04:04,160","04:07,320","\"Pink and orange makes it seem like sherbert\""]
["04:07,320","04:14,480","\"Like it would be really sweet if when I grew up there was a there was a sweet candy called fruit salad and that's what it reminds me\""]
["04:15,400","04:18,320","\"Do you think if you ate the goop it would be toxic and you'd die?\""]
["04:18,320","04:21,280","\"Probably it's just paint Julian\""]
["04:21,280","04:29,060","\"It's paint like goop. Okay. Okay. What about goop like paint. What about painting goopy?\""]
["04:29,060","04:32,600","\"Painty goop-a\""]
["04:32,600","04:40,280","\"How come I was glad do you think it was you're going to yeah, we're where did he find it again?\""]
["04:40,280","04:44,380","\"He just found it on the ground and then he took it and nobody no big question\""]
["04:44,380","04:47,780","\"He gave him a 20 minute tutorial and now he's in prison.\""]
["04:47,780","04:50,340","\"- Let's linger on this shot for our goddamn eternity.\""]
["04:50,340","04:56,340","\"'Cause it's the first time Mario's ever been in jail.\""]
["04:56,340","04:57,340","\"That's not true.\""]
["04:57,340","04:59,740","\"The Mario Party commercial, he got arrested.\""]
["04:59,740","05:00,740","\"- What was he doing?\""]
["05:00,740","05:02,020","\"- Having a party.\""]
["05:02,020","05:02,860","\"- That's fair.\""]
["05:02,860","05:04,020","\"That one looks really tasty.\""]
["05:04,020","05:05,700","\"- It does, it looks like chocolate.\""]
["05:05,700","05:08,180","\"I love the goop, I love it.\""]
["05:08,180","05:09,780","\"I think it's such a cool concept\""]
["05:09,780","05:11,940","\"and it disappoints me that it falls off\""]
["05:11,940","05:13,380","\"towards the end of the game.\""]
["05:13,380","05:15,380","\"I\""]
["05:15,380","05:23,860","\"Just have weird hang I have weird things that I fixate on and paint is probably one of the things I fixate on the most\""]
["05:23,860","05:28,180","\"Smelling it eating it. I wish you could eat paint\""]
["05:28,180","05:35,380","\"I think we discussed that's that's your famous quote now. I think we discussed already how I\""]
["05:35,380","05:38,540","\"Really wanted to eat the tubby custard because it was just pink goop\""]
["05:38,540","05:43,180","\"What do you think about scene and hook where they're all throwing pain at each other and eating it sounds good to me?\""]
["05:43,180","05:50,580","\"Have you seen it? No. What? No. Julian. Wait, yes, I have. Yes. I remember that scene. Okay. I was like\""]

["05:56,260","06:00,240","\"You said Hock and I thought I thought you meant like a huckleberry fin\""]
["06:00,240","06:07,800","\"We say hook in this country and where we speak English. Huckleberry fin. I wrote a good hook\""]
["06:09,780","06:15,340","\"What are you sitting like that? Yeah, we're gonna just watch him sit here for fucking ever. You can skip it can't you? No\""]
["06:15,340","06:17,740","\"Can't skip it\""]
["06:17,740","06:19,740","\"Hi, yeah, hi\""]
["06:19,740","06:24,280","\"Chris what this was a big deal. No one ever spoke good much\""]
