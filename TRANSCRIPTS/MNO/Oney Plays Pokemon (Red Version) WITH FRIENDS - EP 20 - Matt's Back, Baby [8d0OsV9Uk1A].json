["00:10,200","00:16,720","\"I remember even tournament rules that would say you cannot use any freeze moves that's banned from tournament.\""]
["00:16,720","00:19,040","\"Really? Yes. You just couldn't have like ice beam.\""]
["00:19,040","00:22,320","\"Yeah, Nintendo even had an official tournament instead you can't have freezing.\""]
["00:22,320","00:25,680","\"So they just weren't thinking when they set it up.\""]
["00:25,680","00:29,280","\"A lot of the shit in this game just doesn't work. There's a really good\""]
["00:29,280","00:36,440","\"infographic on it just listing everything that doesn't work in this game because a lot of moves are supposed to do things and\""]
["00:36,440","00:40,820","\"Then because of the programming they don't do what they're supposed to do. Can we look at the infographic?\""]
["00:40,820","00:47,160","\"Yeah, let me look this up first. Okay, but one of the things is there's a move that's supposed to increase your accuracy\""]
["00:47,160","00:53,800","\"But when you yeah decreases it divides it by 255 so you're never going to hit attack ever again\""]
["00:53,800","00:56,580","\"What the fuck?\""]
["00:56,580","01:01,140","\"So there's love just fucked up. Yeah, they fucked up that they just didn't\""]
["01:01,140","01:06,340","\"Put it in right. So something that's supposed to help you completely flex you. Yes. Wow and\""]
["01:06,340","01:13,620","\"You wouldn't be aware of it in any way unless you do like that's how it was coated. That's pretty epic\""]
["01:13,620","01:21,100","\"Oh my god, you're getting killed by vault orb by leveling up here. We go. He was little yes his leech seat level seven\""]
["01:21,940","01:28,820","\"Yeah, it just means that it skipped over it has have you leveled them up again since yeah, that's because he learned\""]
["01:28,820","01:31,060","\"vine web\""]
["01:31,060","01:37,380","\"Why would it fucking skip it does so we seriously can't get that move anymore because I guess look up if it's um\""]
["01:37,380","01:41,220","\"If it's a TM, but I don't think it is better be and if it's a TM\""]
["01:41,220","01:44,620","\"We could probably just teach it to something that's more interesting like wild plume anyway\""]
["01:44,620","01:47,100","\"That's true, too. We could just do it through someone else. Oh\""]
["01:47,820","01:52,520","\"That yeah, actually that's a good point. There's plenty of other Pokemon that have leech seed like your mom\""]
["01:52,520","01:55,700","\"She leeches on my seed\""]
["01:55,700","01:59,320","\"That was good Chris. That was a real joke\""]
["01:59,320","02:01,460","\"she\""]
["02:01,460","02:02,860","\"She's dead\""]
["02:02,860","02:08,380","\"Here it is if the effective leech seed is also under the effect of toxic leech seed damage will increase\""]
["02:08,380","02:14,660","\"Every turn as the end value of toxic increases because leech seed and toxic both use the same damage algorithm\""]
["02:15,660","02:17,660","\"Oh, I like a rhythm you mister\""]
["02:17,660","02:19,480","\"Milster\""]
["02:19,480","02:20,980","\"Mr. Mr\""]
["02:20,980","02:24,460","\"You know that that's from Julian. What's that from a little happy go more?\""]
["02:24,460","02:27,340","\"Never saw it. What if you're so happy?\""]
["02:27,340","02:32,100","\"Mr. Mr. Really annoyed just went yes\""]
["02:32,100","02:35,340","\"You know it's been a real piece. Yeah, we're gonna have to get it through a\""]
["02:35,340","02:38,420","\"Vile plume. I mean does Valplume learn leech see\""]
["02:38,420","02:40,400","\"Probably I'm pretty well\""]
["02:40,400","02:46,660","\"I'm not sure if it does you better I think if if he doesn't then probably we can get it through victory Bell\""]
["02:46,660","02:51,140","\"Who's vial plume again?\""]
["02:51,140","02:56,680","\"He's the the the raffa-lesia someone else for sure he gets toxic\""]
["02:56,680","02:59,340","\"Fuck is a raffa-lesia. It's the corpse flower\""]
["02:59,340","03:03,880","\"It smells like it smells like rotting meat or that you look down and you see his little tummy. Yeah\""]
["03:03,880","03:07,560","\"No, leech seed. Oh\""]
["03:07,560","03:12,800","\"Who do you get leech seed through just look at look up leech seed and it'll have a list of Pokemon that do it\""]
["03:12,800","03:17,320","\"That really fucking I didn't know that happens. I make me neither\""]
["03:17,320","03:21,380","\"It doesn't make sense. Yes, it does because of how program this game is program\""]
["03:21,380","03:24,260","\"Well, yeah, please sense to me that they didn't even think about that\""]
["03:24,260","03:25,920","\"I\""]
["03:25,920","03:27,720","\"Want you would hope is like okay\""]
["03:27,720","03:33,280","\"Well, if I level up again the game will recognize that I did and I'll give me the move I miss but I don't think it does\""]
["03:34,360","03:37,800","\"Has you done that haven't you yeah, he's leveled up a bunch of times\""]
["03:37,800","03:40,360","\"Fucking crazy\""]

["04:16,800","04:20,320","\"We're not gonna get him for a while, but then the other thing is that's it\""]
["04:20,320","04:26,640","\"Two Pokemon this generation it'll still work and execute execute's good cuz he's no psychic\""]
["04:26,640","04:31,360","\"Executor is actually really execute part psychic. Yeah. Yeah, but he's a stupid tree\""]

["05:08,080","05:10,000","\"I was talking about what kind of porn is there it is?\""]
["05:10,000","05:11,000","\"There it is.\""]

["06:25,540","06:26,700","\"- I meant to say Jungle Book,\""]

["06:32,740","06:34,300","\"- It makes sense because I sell books\""]
["06:34,300","06:35,140","\"at Barnes & Noble,\""]
["06:35,140","06:37,140","\"and Jungle Book would have to be a Barnes & Noble.\""]

["06:51,200","06:54,140","\"Yeah, thanks for inviting us. Did you get some?\""]
["06:54,140","07:01,840","\"Kappa maki come sit come for some Tom ago. Oh shit. I yeah, I fucking love the music\""]

["07:05,580","07:09,980","\"Jen what did I miss what a bunch of dirty Jen wonders?\""]
["07:11,220","07:18,320","\"Leech seed and toxic went off the same damage calculator when they were stacked making leech seed drain double the damage\""]
["07:18,320","07:22,540","\"Toxic doubt and toxic deal double the damage leech seed drain each time\""]
["07:22,540","07:27,780","\"So it just keeps multiplying and multiplying until they just fucking die. Yep Wow\""]
["07:27,780","07:30,420","\"That's why I wanted to do it\""]
["07:30,420","07:36,080","\"Toxic turned into normal poison if you switched out while under the effects of it. What really that sucks\""]
["07:36,080","07:41,020","\"Critical hits were based off speed making fast sweepers doing same amounts of crit\""]
["07:41,020","07:42,420","\"Yup, no way.\""]
["07:42,420","07:46,580","\"Instacill moves were also based off speed, making most of them totally useless because\""]
["07:46,580","07:49,460","\"they were on slower dudes.\""]
["07:49,460","07:53,980","\"Due to a glitch, focus energy cuts your critical hit rate by 75% instead of doubling it like\""]
["07:53,980","07:55,740","\"what it's supposed to do.\""]
["07:55,740","07:59,380","\"Criticals would ignore stat-ups from both parties rather than just a target.\""]
["07:59,380","08:04,260","\"Three sword dances would do more damage than a critical, resulting in hilarious, look-stacking\""]

["08:05,260","08:07,260","\"My fucking can't say that word\""]
["08:07,260","08:09,500","\"scenario\""]
["08:09,500","08:16,800","\"Using agility would completely negate the speed of speed loss from paralysis as in paralysis cuts your speed in half\""]
["08:16,800","08:20,280","\"An agility just gives you back regular speed stat and then doubles it\""]
["08:20,280","08:23,380","\"We're in Jesus the same thing goes for sword dance burn\""]
["08:23,380","08:28,080","\"If you were frozen, you'd never thought unless someone used a fire attack on you\""]
["08:28,080","08:32,040","\"Haze with thought the enemy in addition to its intended effect\""]
["08:32,840","08:38,280","\"So you can use haze to get out of that nice, but not really what do you think of the right you sprite?\""]
["08:38,280","08:43,480","\"He's a cutie. He looks like he's running really really fast. So it's making him stretch out\""]
["08:43,480","08:46,440","\"I remember I thought he was obese when I saw him when I was younger\""]
["08:46,440","08:51,720","\"Yes, I said that he's giant because if the sprites take up the entire area and made them come on. Oh, yeah\""]
["08:51,720","08:53,720","\"Oh, you thought he was like\""]
["08:53,720","08:58,220","\"Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be enormous. What did I miss guys? What did I miss? I'm back. We fucked up our game\""]
["08:58,220","09:02,600","\"Did you really yeah one of the things I wanted to do we can't do because the game fucked up in a way\""]

["09:23,440","09:28,280","\"Okay, so you're assuming that a woman is only a slut if she is a man whore\""]
["09:29,440","09:36,960","\"That's true you mean you can't be a man or warp bind spinfire and clamp prevented the opponent from doing anything for two to five moves\""]
["09:36,960","09:42,840","\"Also, if you switched out while you were holding the enemy they'd still be considered trapped during the switching turn\""]
["09:42,840","09:45,280","\"What does that mean?\""]
["09:45,280","09:47,800","\"It means when they sent out the next one their trip to\""]
