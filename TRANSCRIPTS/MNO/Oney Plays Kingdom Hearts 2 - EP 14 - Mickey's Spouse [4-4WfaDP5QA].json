["08:50,040","08:50,880","\"- Me too.\""]

["09:08,000","09:12,800","\"It was just kind of there. It wasn't like anything as a movie necessarily.\""]
["09:12,800","09:17,600","\"Like, yeah, thinking about it, I don't like a single movie they made, but I just love looking at them.\""]
["09:17,600","09:21,200","\"Like, even the Minions movie was horrible, but it looked nice.\""]

["12:06,620","12:09,380","\"kiss on lip\""]
["12:09,380","12:13,580","\"The fuck happened to her house\""]
["12:13,580","12:16,620","\"It's been blowing in the wind\""]
["12:17,180","12:19,780","\"Someone just held a fucking hairdryer over everything\""]
["12:19,780","12:25,640","\"Oh my god, you have to protect her you have to erect her\""]
["12:25,640","12:30,220","\"Oh my god, you're protecting Mickey Mouse's spouse\""]
["12:30,220","12:35,500","\"Mickey's spouse as they say Mickey Mouse and a blouse. It's Mickey Mouse's spouse\""]
["12:35,500","12:46,380","\"Mickey's spouse is wearing a stinky blouse. Why is that any stinky cuz it runs with Minkey?\""]
["12:46,380","12:49,380","\"He had Satan in Kymau.\""]
["12:49,380","12:52,380","\"Has there ever been a Minky Mouse?\""]
["12:52,380","12:54,380","\"I bet there has to be one.\""]
["12:54,380","12:56,380","\"Didn't you say Minky Mouse?\""]
["12:56,380","12:57,380","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["12:57,380","12:59,380","\"Bugs burning.\""]
["12:59,380","13:03,380","\"Bugs burning.\""]
["13:03,380","13:05,380","\"I forgot about that.\""]
["13:05,380","13:06,380","\"One moment.\""]
["13:06,380","13:08,380","\"Allow me to kill myself.\""]
["13:08,380","13:09,380","\"How horrible.\""]
["13:09,380","13:11,380","\"She walks into it.\""]
["13:11,380","13:12,380","\"She's...\""]
["13:12,380","13:15,380","\"The laser door slices her up.\""]
["13:15,380","13:17,380","\"Like Resident Evil 1.\""]
["13:17,380","13:20,380","\"She says just one second when she kills herself.\""]
["13:20,380","13:25,380","\"I thought that was actually pretty cool in Resident Evil the movie.\""]
["13:25,380","13:29,380","\"Or in Resident Evil 4 the way they kind of do that scene from the first movie.\""]
["13:29,380","13:32,380","\"When Minnie says you're all going to die here.\""]
["13:32,380","13:35,380","\"No, the lasers scene. Stop making fun of them.\""]
["13:35,380","13:37,380","\"They did say that in the movie they made a point of it.\""]
["13:37,380","13:38,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["13:38,380","13:43,380","\"Have they announced whether or not they're going to continue it by the way?\""]
["13:43,380","13:47,980","\"Or is that really the last one the movie? Yeah, I think that's the last one\""]
["13:47,980","13:52,300","\"I kind of wish they'd they do a Resident Evil movie series that was actually good\""]
["13:52,300","13:57,660","\"Maybe someday like like why do people make bad things just make good things?\""]
["13:57,660","14:01,660","\"No, but you know what I mean? Like I wish they made an eerie like not actiony\""]
["14:01,660","14:05,580","\"Resident Evil movie that was I shouldn't have done that that followed the plot of the game\""]
["14:05,580","14:07,480","\"But not I feel like you know\""]
["14:07,480","14:12,940","\"I take a lot of discipline from a game studio to properly sit down and try to work with\""]
["14:12,940","14:15,880","\"people on a project like this.\""]
["14:15,880","14:23,160","\"And even then, video game writing within video games, people can swallow it pretty easily.\""]
["14:23,160","14:25,760","\"Most of that's not going to handle well as an actual movie script.\""]
["14:25,760","14:28,360","\"No, I was thinking about it for a Resident Evil movie to work this.\""]
["14:28,360","14:33,600","\"Sure, they would need to give Jill or Barry or Chris some kind of overall problem.\""]
["14:33,600","14:37,160","\"Do you remember the original script that you're going to have for the movie?\""]
["14:37,160","14:41,660","\"George Romero. Yeah, it was terrible. It was so bad. I didn't do it\""]
["14:41,660","14:44,800","\"I never read it and I know they were doing that with it though\""]
["14:44,800","14:50,500","\"So the Mario movie had a different script originally I kept getting all these revisions just done to it\""]
["14:50,500","14:54,160","\"Yeah, but like the Resident Evil story as it is would not work for a movie\""]
["14:54,160","14:58,040","\"No, I don't think you would need to give them more character. Yeah, but uh a lot more\""]
["14:58,040","14:59,640","\"but uh\""]
["14:59,640","15:04,820","\"Another problem with George Romero's script was that he was like I want this person to be cast and like they were just like\""]
["15:05,400","15:10,060","\"It's not suited at all for the characters. It would just piss people off really badly fucking Christ\""]
["15:10,060","15:14,000","\"Just make a movie about a Barry with Jill\""]
["15:14,000","15:16,640","\"That's a bad stain bears\""]
["15:16,640","15:23,940","\"They should do the whole movie from Jill's perspective left let Crisco missing and the way to do the movie is just do it like the opening\""]
["15:23,940","15:25,940","\"Yeah, I\""]
["15:25,940","15:31,180","\"Would I'd be really happy if they just went with that either do it and over the top cheesy stupid film\""]
["15:31,180","15:34,680","\"Which would be fucking hilarious or they could do a serious cool thing. Yeah\""]
["15:34,680","15:37,480","\"But they're not gonna do it.\""]
["15:37,480","15:39,560","\"Instead you've got a mix of both.\""]
["15:39,560","15:43,200","\"You got a stupid action movie with a stupid character no one likes.\""]
["15:43,200","15:44,880","\"Excuse me, she's the coolest.\""]
["15:44,880","15:48,440","\"Remember when she crashed the motorcycle through the window to pin down the dogs?\""]
["15:48,440","15:50,560","\"Remember when she kicks a dog in the head and kills it?\""]
["15:50,560","15:51,080","\"Yes.\""]
["15:51,080","15:52,960","\"Fuck that movie.\""]
["15:52,960","15:55,720","\"Remember fucking boring, fast and furious girl?\""]
["15:55,720","15:57,720","\"Remember that Jill is not allowed to be cool.\""]
["15:57,720","16:01,520","\"She lights a cigarette and throws it behind her to blow up the thing, but it goes out.\""]
["16:01,520","16:08,880","\"So then I didn't remember her name new character has to read light Jill cigarette midair to prove that she's the cool character\""]
["16:08,880","16:15,360","\"Her name's Alice Alice. That's right Alice like Alice in Wonderland except it's Blunderland cuz they fucked up the city\""]
["16:15,360","16:17,560","\"That's a pretty good review Chris\""]
["16:17,560","16:20,200","\"Maggie\""]
["16:20,200","16:27,640","\"It's like Alice in Wonderland except it's Alice in Blunderland\""]
["16:29,480","16:32,800","\"Well, that's a really confusing review. I need to read the rest of it\""]
["16:32,800","16:36,120","\"Why don't we start a website?\""]
["16:36,120","16:42,120","\"That's how it works you belch into a microphone that makes post for you you\""]
["16:42,120","16:45,880","\"microphone and then it uses text to speech and\""]
["16:45,880","16:55,280","\"Then it writes your views. Yeah, it's a gaming blog and it just picks a random image of a game character and puts that text next to it\""]
["16:58,320","16:59,320","\"I'm trying!\""]
["16:59,320","17:00,320","\"I'm trying!\""]
["17:00,320","17:01,320","\"I'm trying!\""]
["17:01,320","17:03,760","\"They're animation takes too long.\""]
["17:03,760","17:04,960","\"Yeah, you're right.\""]
["17:04,960","17:05,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["17:05,960","17:08,120","\"And you can't hit it when it starts.\""]
["17:08,120","17:09,560","\"She's kind of annoying.\""]
["17:09,560","17:10,560","\"Yeah.\""]
["17:10,560","17:11,560","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["17:11,560","17:12,560","\"You did it!\""]
["17:12,560","17:16,960","\"Okay, now let's get the shit over with.\""]
["17:16,960","17:23,000","\"Why did she scream like that?\""]
["17:23,000","17:24,600","\"Why literally making that sound?\""]
["17:24,600","17:28,160","\"Why is that sound in the video game?\""]
["17:28,160","17:36,880","\"She keeps doing it.\""]
["17:36,880","17:42,080","\"Why are the giant statues of Gufi and Donald a different armor?\""]
["17:42,080","17:45,440","\"Maybe that's what they were a regionally little Luke-lover.\""]
["17:45,440","17:48,080","\"But then 2000 years passed.\""]
["17:48,080","17:53,040","\"Sit your perfect little Mickey asshole on that little scene.\""]
["17:53,040","17:55,840","\"Oh, they're bad.\""]
["17:55,840","18:00,700","\"You just killed them.\""]
["18:00,700","18:02,700","\"I love this chair.\""]
