["14:16,300","14:18,460","\"I recommend seeing the original Japanese one.\""]
["14:18,460","14:20,460","\"Wait, isn't this supposed to be in the '70s?\""]

["16:05,080","16:09,360","\"This this is really advanced for when it came out. They like to push the envelope\""]
["16:09,360","16:17,760","\"I'm glad that big budget games like this existed then but now you're sad that big budget games exist now. I kind of\""]
["16:17,760","16:25,460","\"It's not the industry is not the same as it once was now is the time of the indie major\""]
["16:25,460","16:27,520","\"I've spotted two enemy soldiers\""]
["16:28,200","16:31,280","\"They're probably KGB troops sent to guard Sokolov\""]

["17:01,640","17:03,440","\"Is that kind of defeat the entire point of it?\""]
["17:03,440","17:08,240","\"Um, I mean technically it just kind of saves you from like opening up a menu and doing it\""]
["17:08,240","17:11,480","\"So I'm not super mad about it, but yeah\""]
["17:11,480","17:14,600","\"I guess it's just the cool thing to do I guess\""]
["17:14,600","17:19,400","\"It's really neat effect. Yeah, I think that that was the idea at the time\""]
["17:19,400","17:23,840","\"It was probably like a tech like oh look at this kind of thing\""]
["17:24,760","17:29,320","\"Still pretty neat by today's standards honestly. Yeah, I really haven't seen anything else do that\""]
["17:29,320","17:32,680","\"The octopus camouflage\""]
["17:32,680","17:40,320","\"Do you think all of is all of drab already your best bet? Yeah, maybe let's see camouflage. Oh my god\""]
["17:40,320","17:43,440","\"It's it's fucking circle and not X X goes back\""]
["17:43,440","17:46,120","\"That's pretty common in like\""]
["17:46,120","17:49,740","\"What's the man's gonna know that is the right?\""]
["17:49,740","17:54,080","\"Yes, they keep that oh no you can't do these dude\""]
["17:54,080","17:57,540","\"Wow, so you just get them I\""]
["17:57,540","18:05,080","\"Think the right guys. I'm a friend you could be a desert tiger works even more little frog little frog\""]
["18:05,080","18:09,020","\"You missed it don't kill and eat that little frog\""]
["18:09,020","18:18,400","\"I\""]
["18:21,040","18:26,800","\"I'm gonna go foraging in this little tree. You're gonna find me some boogers. Pour me out a boot of that\""]
["18:26,800","18:31,720","\"This is for me a boot of boogers. This guy's taking a sweet ass time\""]
["18:31,720","18:38,640","\"I know bugs. This is just fruit punch that you have its summer camp really that's what we called it when I went to summer camp\""]
["18:38,640","18:42,720","\"Called bug juice so what was difference about subsistence?\""]
["18:42,720","18:49,880","\"So maybe I can do it now so the original had a camera like this you can switch back and forth\""]
["18:49,880","18:50,720","\"- Oh.\""]
["18:50,720","18:51,960","\"- The original has like a fixed camera\""]
["18:51,960","18:55,640","\"and subsistence has like your kind of traditional like--\""]
["18:55,640","18:57,600","\"- Oh, 3D or third person.\""]
["18:57,600","18:59,440","\"- But I mean like all the metal gears\""]
["18:59,440","19:01,720","\"were like kind of like top down and you know,\""]
["19:01,720","19:04,840","\"so like if I do that, that's kind of how it looked.\""]
["19:04,840","19:07,160","\"- Why did people not like that?\""]
["19:07,160","19:10,200","\"- It's just the camera is like a little weird at some places\""]
["19:10,200","19:12,040","\"and it gives you like one singular angle.\""]
["19:12,040","19:14,640","\"So if I was coming from the other direction,\""]
["19:14,640","19:16,600","\"this angle would actually like really suck.\""]
["19:16,600","19:17,600","\"- Ah.\""]
["19:17,600","19:20,760","\"But that's how two was.\""]
["19:20,760","19:21,760","\"But yeah, I can.\""]
["19:21,760","19:24,920","\"I guess it makes more sense in two because the areas are more constricted.\""]
["19:24,920","19:29,000","\"I mean, it does make sense to because you can kind of see like, oh, there's a guy right\""]
["19:29,000","19:30,000","\"there.\""]
["19:30,000","19:32,440","\"Oh, well, oh God.\""]
["19:32,440","19:33,440","\"That was close.\""]
["19:33,440","19:35,720","\"Yeah, my camouflage is like 95%.\""]
["19:35,720","19:40,600","\"So he's going to have trouble seeing me, but I he fucking blended in.\""]
["19:40,600","19:43,040","\"She fucking tricked me.\""]
["19:43,040","19:44,880","\"Ironically enough.\""]
["19:44,880","19:48,640","\"I think I'm even more invisible on the ground because I'm wearing this fucking like\""]
["19:48,640","19:56,480","\"Desert tiger thing than I am in the bushes get into the bushes. Oh, you're saying you think you're more invisible than if you go look\""]
["19:56,480","19:59,160","\"It goes down to eighty four weird. Yeah\""]
["19:59,160","20:02,160","\"More you know to them are\""]
["20:02,160","20:09,840","\"I'm virtually invisible. This is very virtuous. It is. Yeah, I'm definitely doing the right thing here\""]
["20:14,400","20:19,500","\"Not at all in fact I'm almost positive he's going to but to risk him who is what\""]
["20:19,500","20:29,220","\"What do you mean? What's that fuck? Oh, it's bad. Ah white. Why won't he okay? You've just jeopardized\""]
["20:29,220","20:33,380","\"The fuck I am cold war hot. Oh god. I need a go-lile\""]
["20:33,380","20:37,680","\"They're about to launch nukes at every US city\""]
["20:37,680","20:42,960","\"Because these guys saw you out of your these these desert tiger fuck\""]
["20:42,960","20:47,960","\"I think you might want to just kill him now.\""]
["20:47,960","20:48,960","\"I don't know if I can.\""]
["20:48,960","20:49,960","\"I'm not supposed to do that.\""]
["20:49,960","20:50,960","\"He told me not to do that.\""]
["20:50,960","20:52,960","\"Well then you better run.\""]
["20:52,960","20:54,960","\"Jesus.\""]
["20:54,960","20:56,960","\"Oh, there's ammo in there.\""]
["20:56,960","20:58,960","\"He's conked out at least.\""]
["20:58,960","20:59,960","\"Yep.\""]
["20:59,960","21:01,960","\"How do you lose them?\""]
["21:01,960","21:05,960","\"Uh, you got a run to another screen.\""]
["21:05,960","21:07,960","\"Navy SEALs.\""]
["21:07,960","21:08,960","\"Okay.\""]
