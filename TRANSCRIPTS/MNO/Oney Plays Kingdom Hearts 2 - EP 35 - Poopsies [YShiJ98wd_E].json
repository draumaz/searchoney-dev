["00:15,900","00:17,400","\"I wanna see Ariel.\""]
["00:17,400","00:20,200","\"I mean, we could. I think there's another...\""]
["00:20,200","00:21,400","\"Another mission to do there.\""]
["00:21,400","00:22,900","\"I wanna see Ariel.\""]
["00:22,900","00:25,700","\"She's the most beautiful...\""]
["00:25,700","00:27,700","\"Damn fucking fish.\""]
["00:27,700","00:28,700","\"I've ever seen.\""]
["00:28,700","00:31,860","\"She's the best creature under the sea.\""]
["00:31,860","00:35,660","\"Chris, if you were, let's imagine a hypothetical\""]
["00:35,660","00:38,580","\"where you were a single mermaid and you know Ariel.\""]
["00:38,580","00:39,420","\"- Yeah.\""]
["00:39,420","00:42,820","\"- But to date her, you would have to like\""]
["00:42,820","00:44,780","\"participate in all these musicals with her.\""]
["00:44,780","00:45,900","\"Would you do it?\""]
["00:45,900","00:47,780","\"- Yeah, 'cause there's nothing better to do.\""]
["00:47,780","00:49,180","\"- Okay.\""]
["00:49,180","00:51,500","\"- And I get good at singing doing it.\""]
["00:51,500","00:52,660","\"- That's true, you're a musician,\""]
["00:52,660","00:55,340","\"so you'd probably be naturally inclined.\""]
["00:55,340","00:57,540","\"- There's literally nothing else to do down here.\""]
["00:57,540","00:58,380","\"- This is great.\""]
["00:58,380","00:59,660","\"That's why she's going crazy.\""]
["00:59,660","01:03,260","\"What do you think Mermaid Society is like?\""]
["01:03,260","01:04,540","\"What do they do around town?\""]
["01:04,540","01:06,180","\"Have sex and play music.\""]
["01:06,180","01:07,860","\"They call it garbage and sit there.\""]
["01:07,860","01:11,020","\"I, that feels accurate to me.\""]
["01:11,020","01:12,500","\"What else are they going to do?\""]
["01:12,500","01:13,700","\"That feels accurate to me.\""]
["01:13,700","01:15,660","\"They lay eggs on each other and then fuck.\""]
["01:15,660","01:18,060","\"And that's what I'm going to do.\""]
["01:18,060","01:21,460","\"Who knows how the eggs got there.\""]
["01:21,460","01:25,020","\"I'm going to prove it to you.\""]
["01:25,020","01:26,940","\"So help me Ariel.\""]
["01:26,980","01:28,580","\"I am going to get through.\""]
["01:28,580","01:30,380","\"I am going to abandon now.\""]
["01:30,380","01:32,780","\"I'm going to get through you with the strident.\""]
["01:32,780","01:33,880","\"He's going to fight.\""]
["01:33,880","01:34,580","\"Oh my god.\""]
["01:34,580","01:35,980","\"No!\""]
["01:35,980","01:37,480","\"No!\""]
["01:37,480","01:38,480","\"Jesus.\""]
["01:38,480","01:39,280","\"He was kind of dangerous.\""]
["01:39,280","01:40,280","\"Oh no.\""]
["01:40,280","01:46,380","\"To be fair, she was in the wrong.\""]
["01:46,380","01:48,380","\"She stole a statue.\""]
["01:48,380","01:50,380","\"She didn't steal as she found.\""]
["01:50,380","01:52,980","\"She stole it from the human's.\""]
["01:52,980","01:55,780","\"What's gone now?\""]
["01:55,780","01:57,480","\"Why is there no dream on G-World?\""]
["01:57,480","02:01,840","\"- Is that picking up my jacket?\""]
["02:01,840","02:04,140","\"Is she gonna sing a sad song?\""]
["02:04,140","02:06,300","\"- Ursula, is this Ursula?\""]
["02:06,300","02:07,140","\"- It is.\""]
["02:07,140","02:08,500","\"- Oh, I'm sorry, I need to press a button.\""]
["02:08,500","02:09,580","\"- Yay!\""]
["02:09,580","02:10,420","\"- Wow.\""]
["02:10,420","02:11,540","\"- She's back for no reason.\""]
["02:11,540","02:12,740","\"- And she looks terrible.\""]
["02:12,740","02:13,580","\"(laughs)\""]
["02:13,580","02:15,500","\"- It's true, she looked better in the first game, didn't she?\""]
["02:15,500","02:16,380","\"- Yeah.\""]
["02:16,380","02:18,380","\"She looked really good in the first game.\""]
["02:18,380","02:23,220","\"- It's gotta be the same model, why would they change it?\""]
["02:23,220","02:24,260","\"- No, it probably is.\""]
["02:24,260","02:28,820","\"She had it. I remember the head that you fight. Yeah, that's probably yeah, that would make sense\""]
["02:28,820","02:32,500","\"Um, how is she alive?\""]
["02:32,500","02:34,500","\"Does it explain? No, okay\""]
["02:34,500","02:40,220","\"Chris don't expect that kind of thing. She's a time traveler. You know what everybody is so smart\""]
["02:40,220","02:46,600","\"They got an answer for every little every little nitpick about the kingdom heart story. What's the explanation for Ursula being here?\""]
["02:46,600","02:49,260","\"She's a time traveler. Mm-hmm\""]
["02:49,980","02:51,980","\"That's probably that is probably not a little bit later.\""]
["02:51,980","02:53,980","\"Let the son came back and saved her so exactly.\""]
["02:53,980","02:55,980","\"I don't know. They would say that.\""]
["02:55,980","03:01,980","\"Also, the background is too happy for what we're seeing right now.\""]
["03:01,980","03:05,980","\"Perhaps you traveled before the events of Kingdom Hearts 1.\""]
["03:05,980","03:07,980","\"Those eels look really good.\""]
["03:07,980","03:09,980","\"Are we in? Are you smooth?\""]
["03:09,980","03:13,980","\"What did he say?\""]
["03:13,980","03:15,980","\"What did he say?\""]
["03:15,980","03:17,980","\"- You pretty much-- - Hey, smash!\""]
["03:17,980","03:19,480","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:19,480","03:21,280","\"- Do not shout out. - Shut up!\""]
["03:21,280","03:22,480","\"- That's the one I remember.\""]
["03:22,480","03:23,980","\"- I'm gonna get a spider catch.\""]
["03:23,980","03:24,820","\"- Ooh.\""]
["03:24,820","03:27,480","\"- That looks pretty good.\""]
["03:27,480","03:29,280","\"I like this model.\""]
["03:29,280","03:31,080","\"When she's actually expressive, it works.\""]
["03:31,080","03:32,280","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:32,280","03:35,680","\"I mean, I would say that's all the bottles in this game.\""]
["03:35,680","03:36,520","\"- I can't read that.\""]
["03:36,520","03:37,360","\"- It's a JPEG.\""]
["03:37,360","03:38,560","\"This doesn't say anything.\""]
["03:38,560","03:41,240","\"- I like her little eels.\""]
["03:41,240","03:42,560","\"- Oh, whatever, I'll sign it.\""]
["03:42,560","03:45,120","\"- I like the idea of using a fish skeleton as a pen\""]
["03:45,120","03:53,960","\"cool I like the idea of fucking her that's not part of the film though a little\""]
["03:53,960","04:02,120","\"late there buddy Mon she already signed it what would you do if you found out\""]

["06:01,240","06:05,640","\"How would you feel that one of his stats you blew up?\""]
["06:05,640","06:07,740","\"It cuts back to him and his upper body blew up.\""]
["06:07,740","06:10,440","\"Like it was a voodoo thing.\""]
["06:10,440","06:11,640","\"It's killing her.\""]
["06:11,640","06:14,140","\"I thought he was grabbing her head and shaking it.\""]
["06:14,140","06:17,340","\"Want to get the voice back?\""]
["06:17,340","06:18,140","\"Yeah.\""]

["06:20,040","06:22,540","\"I didn't know that there was so much story in this.\""]
["06:22,540","06:24,540","\"I thought this world was literally just the mini game.\""]
["06:24,540","06:28,440","\"I like the way Donald stares at that crap.\""]
["06:28,440","06:33,780","\"Najulian is this a prequel world? Is this before the world in the first game? Is that how this works?\""]
["06:33,780","06:36,860","\"That wouldn't make any sense\""]
["06:36,860","06:43,460","\"The previous events already took place. Well, then I have no idea you got to explain this to me. You're the kingdom heartmaster\""]
["06:43,460","06:45,460","\"There is no reason\""]
["06:45,460","06:48,860","\"You can make Ursula fix all this\""]
["06:48,860","06:52,500","\"They're just gonna yeah, this is weird\""]
["06:52,500","06:58,100","\"Wait, so what was the story in the first game then just that Ursula is bad and you kill Ursula?\""]
["06:58,100","07:00,700","\"Yeah, well she wanted to get at the keyhole.\""]
["07:00,700","07:04,400","\"I think you are the most beautiful little vixen.\""]
["07:04,400","07:06,800","\"They could have just brought her crazy sister in.\""]
["07:06,800","07:10,600","\"I think we should get married on top of Iraq.\""]
["07:10,600","07:12,700","\"What is your crazy sister's name? I don't know.\""]
["07:12,700","07:14,600","\"I've never seen her crazy sister.\""]

["07:29,000","07:32,600","\"He didn't want to lend his voice to the game anymore.\""]
["07:32,600","07:35,800","\"Don't think about it too much.\""]

["07:58,960","08:01,960","\"Oh no. No they don't want them to eat.\""]
["08:01,960","08:03,960","\"The evil eels are gonna make them fuck.\""]
["08:03,960","08:04,960","\"They're gonna not make them fuck.\""]
["08:04,960","08:06,960","\"No, be embraced.\""]
["08:06,960","08:08,960","\"Oh, it's staged Chris.\""]
["08:08,960","08:10,960","\"What is going on?\""]
["08:10,960","08:13,960","\"Ursula wants to watch them do the dirty deed.\""]
["08:13,960","08:16,960","\"Do the do. I get it.\""]
["08:16,960","08:17,960","\"No sign of Ursula.\""]

["08:24,960","08:27,960","\"What's wrong with her?\""]
["08:27,960","08:29,960","\"She heard a really funny joke.\""]
["08:29,960","08:35,960","\"What would I give you to live where you are?\""]
["08:35,960","08:36,960","\"What?\""]
["08:36,960","08:40,960","\"What would I pay to stay here beside you?\""]
["08:40,960","08:42,960","\"Is this like the movie?\""]
["08:42,960","08:43,960","\"This happens?\""]
["08:43,960","08:45,960","\"Yeah, you don't remember this?\""]

["08:51,960","08:52,960","\"What's up with the price?\""]
["08:52,960","08:59,960","\"I think that'd be a more interesting way to take it, but it's they they portrayed us like he's being mind-controlled\""]
["08:59,960","09:04,160","\"Did that necklace look familiar?\""]
["09:04,160","09:09,040","\"Hey who killed my girlfriend oh?\""]
