["00:26,500","00:32,120","\"I was waiting for my plane, so I was just sitting at the plane waiting chairs.\""]
["00:32,120","00:37,460","\"This guy has these kids that are acting up and yelling and just being shitty.\""]

["00:40,620","00:43,420","\"I don't know what he was saying because he was speaking some other language.\""]
["00:43,420","00:51,340","\"But he takes them over to me and then he puts one on one side of me and one on the other side of me to separate them,\""]
["00:51,340","00:53,340","\"but using me as a divider.\""]
["00:54,860","01:00,740","\"And I was like I was so fucking taken aback like I couldn't believe that a human being would like do that\""]
["01:00,740","01:04,140","\"Intentionally to another human being just stood up and walked away right?\""]
["01:04,140","01:09,680","\"Yeah, I wish I would have fucking said something to him though like I wish in that story\""]
["01:09,680","01:15,040","\"I would have been like dude you cannot do that to people what the fuck that's really bad\""]

["01:40,100","01:43,580","\"And she was like you really need to do something about all this\""]

["02:17,700","02:19,700","\"Maybe she's just jealous you have a house\""]
["02:19,700","02:26,720","\"Wanted wanted to tear you down somehow. Yeah, she was also like there's also a bunch of boxes out here\""]
["02:26,720","02:28,720","\"I'm like yeah, they've been there for a while\""]
["02:28,720","02:31,660","\"Fucking pissed off looking\""]
["02:31,660","02:35,000","\"What an angry little creature that shit\""]
["02:35,000","02:40,540","\"They're just fucking leaning against the wall. They're fine, but they've been there for like a month\""]
["02:40,540","02:45,840","\"But there's no place for them inside you're supposed to throw it out. No, that cost money\""]
["02:46,620","02:50,400","\"Does it yeah, no, they're full of uh, they're full of stuff\""]
["02:50,400","02:54,420","\"So you just have an open them no and it\""]

["02:58,020","03:02,000","\"You're swaying me to this girl's side listen to\""]
["03:02,000","03:04,000","\"Are you the more you just get me about this?\""]
["03:04,000","03:07,460","\"You're just like Harvey Weinstein praying on this woman\""]
["03:07,460","03:15,080","\"The no you're right. I should be a star, but you listen. I agree. I should pick up my shit\""]
["03:15,080","03:19,240","\"It's a little messy just a little tiny bit. It's not like it's covered in goop or fucking\""]
["03:19,240","03:24,840","\"You know trash like smelly juices, but it's just cardboard. It's a cardboard box on my porch\""]
["03:24,840","03:27,680","\"It's hidden from view it like no one on the street can see it\""]
["03:27,680","03:32,680","\"I I still think it's fucked up for a delivery lady to give you shit about it\""]
["03:32,680","03:39,040","\"But and you know what Tomar I'm happy to give you the smartest most intelligentest people of all time of all been messy\""]
["03:39,040","03:41,760","\"So that's my excuse. I'm pretty messy, too\""]
["03:41,760","03:48,280","\"I really have no place Einstein was a big fucking moron and fucking rolling around in his own film\""]
["03:48,280","03:52,460","\"Cripling his feet into his smell yellow socks, and he was the smartest guy of all time\""]
["03:52,460","03:56,080","\"Like was a diaper fur\""]
["03:56,080","04:02,840","\"Me and a couple friends were fucking around on like a diaper furry\""]
["04:02,840","04:08,160","\"Forum and we there was a section called fuck. What was it called?\""]
["04:08,160","04:11,960","\"It was called like real talk or like serious discussions.\""]
["04:11,960","04:12,460","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:12,460","04:13,960","\"And it was just so weird.\""]
["04:13,960","04:20,360","\"It was almost funnier than the weird diaper for shit to just see them talk about like the ethics of reparations.\""]
["04:20,360","04:22,760","\"What is the diaper for community?\""]
["04:22,760","04:23,960","\"You have to say about this.\""]
["04:23,960","04:28,560","\"Well, turns out the diaper for community spread really crosses the aisle.\""]
["04:28,560","04:35,160","\"To be fair, it was like a super nuanced take on reparations from some diaper fur.\""]
["04:35,160","04:38,760","\"Starting to realize that a community of any kind is usually a bad thing.\""]
["04:38,760","04:39,260","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:39,260","04:40,500","\"Everyone should just be...\""]
["04:40,500","04:44,760","\"- A community based on fandom is usually a bad thing for sure.\""]
["04:44,760","04:45,800","\"But what we...\""]
["04:45,800","04:52,220","\"But not necessarily just what we traditional see as fandom, like, shows and games and stuff, but it's like...\""]
["04:52,220","04:55,680","\"Anything. Politics and sports totally count.\""]
["04:55,680","05:00,260","\"Dude, I really fucking missed when video games used to be like a nerdy thing that was considered like...\""]
["05:00,260","05:03,920","\"Like, you know, a lame thing and most people didn't really care.\""]
["05:03,920","05:07,120","\"But now everyone's fucking obsessed and everything sucks.\""]
["05:07,120","05:16,340","\"Uh, I mean, I don't like a lot of things about modern video games, but that's one of the few things I actually, I'll disagree with that.\""]
["05:16,340","05:17,560","\"You like the fandoms?\""]
["05:17,560","05:21,760","\"No, not the fandoms, but I like that it's not weird to play video games no more.\""]
["05:21,760","05:23,280","\"Uh, I just miss it.\""]
["05:23,280","05:33,040","\"Like, I had a friend in, uh, like middle school that would literally like hide his Xbox whenever his girlfriend came over because she like hated video games, and if she saw it, she'd fucking break up with him.\""]
["05:33,040","05:35,040","\"I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about like-\""]
["05:35,040","05:41,580","\"That is a good point though. I feel like that was a real thing that was going on at some point in history\""]
["05:41,580","05:43,580","\"and I don't think it would ever happen now.\""]
["05:43,580","05:52,200","\"Yeah, that's not- that's just actually like fucked, but I'm talking about more so when like, you know, they were just like less common.\""]
["05:52,200","05:57,000","\"Like, like, nearly everyone I grew up around didn't really like games.\""]
["05:57,000","06:00,300","\"But now, fuck that's a good thing for you.\""]
["06:00,300","06:05,500","\"Kind of because the people that did like games, you know, had a little connection with them and\""]
["06:05,500","06:09,120","\"Games were better back then because I was definitely not gamers\""]
["06:09,120","06:11,660","\"That was not what games appeal to everybody so they're getting shit\""]
["06:11,660","06:15,180","\"I think they're just getting shit because they've found more ways to monetize them\""]
["06:15,180","06:20,980","\"Well that but also they're trying to like dumb them down to appeal to just fucking morons. Yeah, okay\""]
["06:20,980","06:22,980","\"I guess I see what you mean with that too\""]
["06:22,980","06:29,140","\"If by that you mean people who would not traditionally have been video game players then yes, I agree\""]
["06:29,140","06:34,260","\"No, I just mean like there's games like like dude played Grand Theft Auto 5 for like an hour\""]
["06:34,260","06:39,500","\"And you can see how fucking dumb down it is at the beginning where it's like you go into that fucking mission\""]
["06:39,500","06:43,020","\"Where you have to kill Mark Zuckerberg with a bomb, but you don't actually get to do anything\""]
["06:43,020","06:46,980","\"You just you follow the shitty instructions and it's not fun\""]
["06:46,980","06:51,860","\"And it's not clever and you're literally just holding up and it's it's dumb down for people that don't play games\""]
["06:51,860","06:56,940","\"I mean, but then there's also stuff that's like intentionally made hard like Dark Souls and shit like that. Yeah\""]
["06:56,940","07:04,340","\"Yeah, in fact, I think the there's yeah, there's been a resurgence in like difficulty for difficulty sake because of\""]
["07:04,340","07:11,160","\"How much like mainstream games try to like coddle you and go and go for that like lowest common denominator\""]
["07:11,160","07:15,480","\"Which if all you're trying to do is make money makes perfect sense, but here's the thing\""]
["07:15,480","07:19,240","\"Dark Souls one wasn't hard just to be hard. It was hard because it was part of the game\""]
["07:19,240","07:23,280","\"It was like an actual like it was the world that was like scary and hard\""]
["07:23,280","07:27,240","\"But Dark Souls 2 they knew like oh players like this game because it was hard\""]
["07:27,240","07:31,240","\"So now we're gonna make the game about being hard, but anyway, that's my little my little\""]
["07:31,240","07:38,000","\"Yeah, I agree black cat\""]
["07:38,000","07:44,520","\"No, there was something about Dark Souls that really brought me back in time like the fact that I didn't know where to go\""]
["07:44,520","07:47,960","\"And like I spent the whole like first few hours of me playing Dark Souls\""]
["07:47,960","07:50,240","\"Trying to go through the graveyard\""]
["07:50,240","07:53,960","\"I'm getting my ass just handed to me over and over again and then realizing oh\""]
["07:53,960","07:56,220","\"I should go that way\""]
["07:56,220","07:59,760","\"Dark Souls one feels like a like a realized world with like\""]
["07:59,760","08:04,000","\"Actual like the whole world just feels like it's really well put together\""]
["08:04,000","08:07,220","\"It's one of those games where you'd struggle and then you go to school and be like yeah\""]
["08:07,220","08:10,000","\"I can't fucking figure out what to do here and someone's like oh wait\""]
["08:10,000","08:13,200","\"You didn't go left and go up the stairs and I'm like wait a minute\""]
["08:13,200","08:19,900","\"Wait, you you can go the wrong place and this is way later in the game and I don't know\""]
["08:19,900","08:26,460","\"It just I also think the internet ruined some of the mystique of video games like going to talk to your friends and being like\""]
["08:26,460","08:30,900","\"I couldn't do this and then they'll show it to you and you like bond over it. I think Dark Souls\""]
["08:30,900","08:38,980","\"Yeah, it didn't really account for game facts existing. Yeah, but it had the the thing where you draw on the ground\""]
["08:38,980","08:41,220","\"online stone so to\""]
["08:41,220","08:47,460","\"Presumably the reason I was putting the game was to tell other people about hidden walls and secret things\""]
["08:47,460","08:51,820","\"But what everybody just does is fucking put a thing on the cliff that says jump here\""]
["08:51,820","08:59,060","\"It's like are you gonna use this for good and to help your friends or are you gonna use this to troll people\""]
["08:59,060","09:04,300","\"Dude when I first played Demon's Souls people weren't abusing that they were literally like trap here look out here\""]
["09:04,300","09:06,740","\"There's a like they were really specific with a little mess\""]
["09:06,740","09:14,020","\"I remember getting a lot of both no definitely the later games trolling got worse the first Dark Souls even\""]
["09:14,020","09:16,980","\"I remember mostly being helpful. Yeah clues\""]
["09:16,980","09:23,600","\"Because the up voting down voting system was in effect in all those games and usually people were honest about their\""]
["09:23,600","09:26,760","\"Their votes, but I think later on everyone was just like\""]
["09:26,760","09:29,740","\"Let's all troll the noobs together\""]
["09:29,740","09:34,660","\"I kind of do wish I could experience games with people like that a game without the internet\""]
["09:34,660","09:42,080","\"It's never gonna happen though. We'll just put out like a like a horrible EMP bomb and destroy all telecom\""]
["09:42,260","09:49,640","\"So that you can enjoy video games again. Yeah, isn't it possible that the Sun could set off a solar flare and like a good plot for a sci-fi thing\""]
["09:49,640","09:52,880","\"Where a guy launches a terrorist attack on all worlds?\""]
["09:52,880","09:59,140","\"communication systems just so he can play video games like he used to in the 90s\""]
["09:59,140","10:00,740","\"Yeah, it's a black mirror episode\""]
["10:00,740","10:06,340","\"Isn't that a thing that can happen though with the Sun like a solar flare can EMP the entire world and fuck everything over?\""]
["10:06,340","10:09,040","\"I've definitely heard this. I think so\""]
["10:09,860","10:14,540","\"I've heard it too, but I don't know if it's true or not. I heard that is that a solar flare\""]
["10:14,540","10:21,260","\"I heard that happened in like 19 10 or something. Yes a solar flare does create I think a huge EMP\""]
["10:21,260","10:27,080","\"That's so fucking scary what it only hit the side of the world. It's facing the Sun or what I mean\""]
["10:27,080","10:32,740","\"So I think solar flares happen all the time, but yeah, I think I guess if it was like pointed at the earth or whatever\""]
["10:32,740","10:36,660","\"I don't totally get how solar flares. What do you mean the side you mean the top?\""]
["10:36,940","10:43,120","\"Well like the solar flares or when those like big things like kind of like like jump off the surf\""]
["10:43,120","10:49,360","\"Like the face of the Sun those little like warm-eat. I think so. Yeah, I could be totally wrong here\""]
["10:49,360","10:56,580","\"But I thought it's like so if one really big one and it was like facing in the direction of Earth happened\""]
["10:56,580","11:02,580","\"It could do some weird shit. Mmm. I sure hope that doesn't happen Tomar\""]
["11:04,020","11:09,820","\"That would break so much of my stuff. Yeah, I'm so hard. I'd be fucking ruined\""]
["11:09,820","11:12,540","\"That would ruin my life\""]
["11:12,540","11:13,420","\"and\""]
["11:13,420","11:16,100","\"I mean you can definitely shield stuff against\""]
["11:16,100","11:22,260","\"electromagnetic radiation, but I don't like like the solar kind\""]
["11:22,260","11:28,100","\"I I think you'd need a lot of a lot of like thick concrete or steel to shield against it\""]
["11:28,100","11:34,420","\"I mean, I just realized like banks and shit like how much of your money is like in actual cash\""]
["11:34,420","11:43,900","\"I don't know although I'd like to think that most banking data is in like data centers that actually would be shielded from a giant\""]
["11:43,900","11:49,220","\"Oh, yeah, you think so tell more you think so mr. I'm not buying gold today\""]
["11:49,220","11:56,140","\"Not me if I had gold would I tell anybody all my money's in the emeralds\""]
["11:56,820","12:01,500","\"You motherfucker. What uh? What was gonna say I forget nevermind\""]
["12:01,500","12:04,180","\"Hey shooting at you fuck\""]
["12:04,180","12:09,480","\"It's like they view me as hostile. I don't know what I've ever done to them\""]
["12:09,480","12:13,240","\"Yeah, no, you're just a friendly little creature being wacky and zany\""]
["12:13,240","12:19,220","\"Don't they see I'm just a member of this community. What would it be without me?\""]
["12:19,220","12:22,780","\"Nothing I say I\""]
["12:22,780","12:24,780","\"like this music\""]
["12:24,740","12:27,420","\"Yeah sure beats out that other one. Yeah\""]
["12:27,420","12:37,660","\"Is this the level with the bears oh there they go there are bears. Yeah, just kill them\""]
["12:37,660","12:41,620","\"That guy's lifting two bikes\""]
["12:41,620","12:44,820","\"This is really like clever art style\""]
["12:44,820","12:47,860","\"It must have been like really easy to make all the shit, but it all looks really nice\""]
["12:47,860","12:52,980","\"Yeah, think about just how many like yeah, you're a 3d artist and it's like yeah\""]
["12:52,980","12:56,200","\"You gotta make like two thousand things in like a year\""]
["12:56,200","12:59,420","\"Yeah, I figure you choose a style like this\""]
["12:59,420","13:05,700","\"Like a very I think they needed it to be low-poly anyway because they had to do all this on the ps2\""]
["13:05,700","13:07,700","\"You know what I just realized it really reminds me of\""]
["13:07,700","13:12,500","\"Can you guess Tomar it's like wheel travel\""]
["13:12,500","13:19,980","\"Is it really like wheel travel all the little humans yeah, I guess a little bit\""]
["13:20,620","13:24,860","\"Do you think wheel travel is secretly made by like a veteran from this game?\""]
["13:24,860","13:30,680","\"I fucking wish we know it's the Japanese guy where that's that's one tiny piece of\""]
["13:30,680","13:33,180","\"Oh my god\""]
["13:33,180","13:39,660","\"Yeah, so we're fucking destroying this game. You're breaking the code. Yeah, you're too good. I\""]
["13:39,660","13:44,700","\"Have only five minutes to grow by a lot. You can do it. I promise\""]

["14:14,540","14:18,260","\"You don't got to worry about a thing\""]
["14:18,260","14:21,100","\"You are larger now\""]
["14:21,100","14:26,540","\"Okay, I think we're getting to a point where we can start rapid growth because we need it. Oh\""]
["14:26,540","14:28,740","\"My god\""]
["14:28,740","14:31,540","\"Look at him go. Oh, why do we need it? Oh?\""]

["15:45,980","15:46,500","\"but--\""]
["15:46,500","15:48,900","\"This is satisfying to watch it get so big.\""]
["15:48,900","15:49,460","\"Yeah.\""]
