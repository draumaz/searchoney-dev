["08:04,280","08:06,280","\"No, I am incapable of this!\""]
["08:06,280","08:09,280","\"I know it's a video game, so you can do a fun little mission.\""]
["08:09,280","08:13,280","\"My point is just, uh, let's break apart a video game.\""]
["08:13,280","08:14,280","\"Oh my god, pour at me.\""]

["08:30,280","08:32,980","\"I can't believe you wanted to quit just now.\""]
["08:32,980","08:35,440","\"This is the shittiest game.\""]
["08:35,440","08:40,040","\"I think all of my enjoyment for the game has run out.\""]
["08:40,040","08:43,480","\"I think the whole fun of this game was just flipping around.\""]
["08:43,480","08:45,680","\"Yeah, the whole fun is literally the control.\""]
["08:45,680","08:47,080","\"Everything else kind of bites.\""]
["08:47,080","08:48,880","\"The missions are all shitty.\""]
["08:48,880","08:51,080","\"How can you say that that was shitty?\""]
["08:51,080","08:53,400","\"Because it's frustrating.\""]
["08:53,400","08:58,080","\"We can't say that I'm surprising.\""]
["08:58,080","09:01,120","\"and they almost got killed. Oh boy, Jacques.\""]
["09:01,120","09:04,560","\"Or Ant-May. Spider-Man!\""]
["09:04,560","09:05,360","\"AHHH!\""]
["09:05,360","09:10,640","\"Spider-Man, um, I think you were not a bad guy, but I will keep my distance.\""]
["09:10,640","09:18,640","\"I think Mr. Zaz. Mr. Zaz is the sparkliest boy that I've ever seen.\""]
["09:18,640","09:24,000","\"It was this fucking shitty newgrounds video that took still images from Batman Begins,\""]
["09:24,000","09:27,380","\"And they just like put lip sync on them with black squares.\""]
["09:27,380","09:29,720","\"I used to think it was the funniest shit in the world.\""]
["09:29,720","09:32,280","\"What do you really like? Like it was like little cell pokebells almost?\""]
["09:32,280","09:34,680","\"Yeah, and they just took still images. They didn't even animate them.\""]
["09:34,680","09:37,520","\"And they just put lip sync on them and they just made them say stupid shit.\""]
["09:37,520","09:43,600","\"There's a part in it where he goes, \"\"I think Mr. Zaz puts the Zaz in Maraz Mataz.\"\"\""]
["09:43,600","09:45,440","\"And I thought it was the funniest thing in the world.\""]
["09:45,440","09:48,880","\"But there's also a part where Liam Neeson, you know the part where...\""]
["09:48,880","09:51,800","\"You probably delivered it better just then too.\""]
["09:52,040","09:57,000","\"No, honestly, I think the voices were kind of funny, but there's a part where it's the balloon\""]
["09:57,000","10:01,220","\"Lee Mneason is staring sadly like looking at the ground. You know in the movie\""]
["10:01,220","10:04,400","\"He's like sitting with Batman in the snow on the mountain at the beginning. Yeah\""]
["10:04,400","10:07,360","\"Yeah, he's just staring like sadly at the ground he goes\""]
["10:07,360","10:11,800","\"I had a wife once but she was eaten by a mighty ape\""]
["10:11,800","10:14,320","\"The funniest thing in the world\""]
["10:14,320","10:20,920","\"Underneath the yeah, I'm actually surprised it has physics like that. Yeah\""]
["10:20,920","10:21,920","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:21,920","10:24,200","\"Webbing the balloon will cut.\""]
["10:24,200","10:25,200","\"What?\""]
["10:25,200","10:26,200","\"I popped it.\""]
["10:26,200","10:27,200","\"Sorry girl.\""]
["10:27,200","10:33,480","\"I just watched Spider-Man destroy that which I had loved.\""]
["10:33,480","10:35,480","\"Spider-Man takes everything from me one day kids.\""]
["10:35,480","10:37,840","\"So is his little string sharp?\""]
["10:37,840","10:38,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:38,840","10:41,360","\"I guess that was the implication.\""]
["10:41,360","10:42,360","\"It's like...\""]
["10:42,360","10:44,480","\"I always thought it was more delicate because we could just wrap around things.\""]
["10:44,480","10:45,480","\"No, it's like those...\""]
["10:45,480","10:47,000","\"It's like stronger than steel, isn't it?\""]
["10:47,000","10:49,920","\"It's like those ski rail things that pick up ski chairs.\""]
["10:49,920","10:54,840","\"And they cut up your hand when you grab them steel cable. Yeah, they cut your hand real badly. Is that confirmed?\""]
["10:54,840","10:57,080","\"Yeah, no, that's a lie\""]
["10:57,080","11:03,220","\"But it was a good lie it was I believe that almost what you said believe that they was spider-man for you\""]
["11:03,220","11:06,380","\"Spider-may spider-may for for one day for\""]
["11:06,380","11:09,360","\"Only a good see me now\""]
["11:09,360","11:17,120","\"I feel like a really what if she just like she gets spider-man powers and immediately just like starts becoming a cougar\""]
["11:17,120","11:23,120","\"I have the energy to get out of the house again. It's time to remarry.\""]
["11:23,120","11:24,120","\"She waste her powers.\""]
["11:24,120","11:29,120","\"Yeah. She doesn't use them to swing around. She just uses them to fucking go out to bars and date.\""]
["11:29,120","11:34,120","\"Hey, SOTY, it's 2018. Let's do a progressive movie. Let's relay Spider-Man.\""]
["11:34,120","11:35,120","\"Spider-Man.\""]
["11:35,120","11:40,120","\"Spider-Man, do it. There's genuinely not enough fucking movies about old ladies that beat the shit out of people.\""]
["11:40,120","11:43,120","\"I don't think there's any movies that do that, really.\""]
["11:43,120","11:45,120","\"I think it's never happened once.\""]
["11:45,120","11:51,240","\"The title truth very rare that old ladies. I don't begin 90 old ones ever swallow around in a movie ever\""]
["11:51,240","11:54,040","\"well\""]
["11:54,040","11:57,400","\"There should be a movie Sergio show cinematic universal\""]
["11:57,400","12:02,120","\"You know they should do they should take that a 3d model on a actually that was young princess Lee\""]
["12:02,120","12:06,000","\"I don't know why I remember that as old princess late. Oh no they do have an old princess lay a 3d model\""]
["12:06,000","12:09,440","\"I have to see you that one of you. Yeah, yeah when she was flying through space\""]
["12:09,440","12:12,760","\"They should take that model and make a movie where she plays an old lady that just like\""]
["12:13,960","12:16,560","\"- Just flips around and jumps around and beats the shit out of these.\""]
["12:16,560","12:20,320","\"- I've had this theory for a while that there's gonna be one actor\""]
["12:20,320","12:23,400","\"that's gonna either die at a really inappropriate time\""]
["12:23,400","12:26,800","\"or just be worth so much money that it's worth doing this for.\""]
["12:26,800","12:28,560","\"That there's eventually gonna be an actor\""]
["12:28,560","12:30,280","\"that they just CG and everything.\""]
["12:30,280","12:31,560","\"- Yeah, maybe.\""]
["12:31,560","12:34,640","\"- My money was like on, if Mark Hamill died,\""]
["12:34,640","12:36,280","\"my money was gonna be on him.\""]
["12:36,280","12:39,400","\"Now I think it's either gonna be if Robert Downey Jr. leaves\""]
["12:39,400","12:42,600","\"or they're gonna do it with Hugh Jackman,\""]
["12:42,600","13:06,860","\"They're gonna bring Wolverine into the, uh, into the Marvel Cinematic\""]
["13:06,860","13:12,620","\"And Logan is literally a CGI Hugh Jackman. That's like 20 years younger the technology is definitely there\""]
["13:12,620","13:15,540","\"It just depends on the the people rigging it and doing it\""]
