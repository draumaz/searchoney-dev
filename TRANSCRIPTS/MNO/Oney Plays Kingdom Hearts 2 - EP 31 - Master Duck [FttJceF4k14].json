["00:08,200","00:09,600","\"Wait a second...\""]
["00:09,600","00:11,200","\"This is cool!\""]
["00:11,200","00:14,400","\"*laughs*\""]
["00:14,400","00:15,800","\"I'm just working!\""]
["00:15,800","00:18,200","\"I just realized this is amazing!\""]
["00:18,200","00:19,800","\"*laughs*\""]
["00:19,800","00:21,400","\"Whoa, you did something cool.\""]
["00:21,400","00:22,200","\"Do that again.\""]
["00:22,200","00:23,200","\"Okay.\""]
["00:23,200","00:25,200","\"Wow.\""]
["00:25,200","00:28,200","\"For sure, a lot of them dancing over in the distance.\""]
["00:28,200","00:32,200","\"It's a neat effect. It works pretty well.\""]
["00:32,200","00:36,200","\"I honestly couldn't tell unless you pointed it at that.\""]
["00:36,200","00:40,200","\"They just have all looping animations in the bag.\""]
["00:40,200","00:44,200","\"It's convincing. When I was a dumb child playing it on a tiny CRT,\""]
["00:44,200","00:48,200","\"I couldn't tell. Yeah, it's pretty good. That's true.\""]
["00:48,200","00:52,200","\"I had one too back then. I remember the first game where I was like,\""]
["00:52,200","00:56,200","\"\"\"Okay, I need to get a bigger TV.\"\" I remember.\""]
["00:56,200","01:00,540","\"- Same TV as this when I played Rayman Origins.\""]
["01:00,540","01:02,820","\"And all the text was so tiny because they expect you\""]
["01:02,820","01:04,840","\"to have a big TV now.\""]
["01:04,840","01:08,840","\"- For the first two years or three years I hated HDTV.\""]
["01:08,840","01:11,760","\"I thought the older TVs made everything look better.\""]
["01:11,760","01:14,080","\"- How do you feel now?\""]
["01:14,080","01:15,920","\"- I like it now.\""]
["01:15,920","01:17,560","\"- You got used to it.\""]
["01:17,560","01:19,940","\"How did you go to see the Lord of the Rings\""]
["01:19,940","01:21,840","\"in the 48 frames per second thing?\""]
["01:21,840","01:23,520","\"- No.\""]
["01:23,520","01:24,440","\"I don't like that.\""]
["01:24,440","01:25,920","\"I don't like movies over 30 frames.\""]
["01:25,920","01:28,200","\"- I don't think it ended up working.\""]
["01:28,200","01:31,320","\"Like it ended up, from what I understand,\""]
["01:31,320","01:34,440","\"just being too expensive to be worth it, right?\""]
["01:34,440","01:37,240","\"- I mean, as far as I know, it makes 3D better,\""]
["01:37,240","01:39,360","\"but I don't care about 3D.\""]
["01:39,360","01:41,560","\"- Have you seen anything that you thought\""]
["01:41,560","01:43,800","\"made particularly good use of 3D?\""]
["01:43,800","01:45,960","\"- I mean, because personally, I don't know\""]
["01:45,960","01:49,520","\"if I've seen anything that was as good for it as Coraline,\""]
["01:49,520","01:52,440","\"and that was like way at the beginning of the 3D stuff.\""]
["01:52,440","01:55,820","\"I mean, Avatar was pretty much made for 3D.\""]
["01:55,820","01:57,300","\"That's true, I've never seen Avatar.\""]
["01:57,300","01:58,660","\"I don't know if that would look better.\""]
["01:58,660","02:01,060","\"You just forget about it after like five minutes.\""]
["02:01,060","02:02,580","\"You honestly don't even notice it.\""]
["02:02,580","02:05,540","\"It doesn't pop out at you.\""]
["02:05,540","02:07,740","\"What is it do then?\""]
["02:07,740","02:10,740","\"It just looks like it's like in the distance.\""]
["02:10,740","02:12,620","\"Like it looks 3D but far away from you.\""]
["02:12,620","02:14,180","\"So like I don't see the point of it.\""]
["02:14,180","02:18,300","\"Were you not immersed in the magical world of Avatar?\""]
["02:18,300","02:20,420","\"Did you not feel like one of the Navi?\""]
["02:20,420","02:20,920","\"No.\""]
["02:20,920","02:24,120","\"We're not as naive as the Navi you want to know something funny\""]
["02:24,120","02:30,680","\"The last time I remember something popping out and feeling like it was right in front of my face was spy kids 3d\""]
["02:30,680","02:34,480","\"I've never had that same like\""]
["02:34,480","02:40,800","\"Robert Rabez came into the theater and grabbed her face and started shaking your face\""]
["02:40,800","02:46,840","\"I think it's cuz back then that's maybe was the red and blue 3d effect. I think that oh yeah\""]
["02:46,840","02:49,600","\"It pops out better, but you lose all the color with it\""]
["02:49,600","02:55,360","\"First do you want to watch spy kids 3d no more is the last time you've seen me\""]
["02:55,360","02:58,320","\"Yeah, I don't really want to see that again. I've seen it. I saw a year ago\""]
["02:58,320","03:04,880","\"It's one of those movies where it's so bad that it makes you like not retroactively not like the before one\""]
["03:04,880","03:12,900","\"It's funny though. I think they're all funny. He's the guy you're the guy and Elijah. What is in it?\""]
["03:12,900","03:16,480","\"It's true. He comes in for a little cameo in the guys right away\""]
["03:16,480","03:21,760","\"Yeah, what is a movie that you feel like you could never ever ever watch it again period?\""]
["03:21,760","03:23,760","\"What's your number?\""]
["03:23,760","03:28,740","\"What is that? It's the thing I told you about yeah, I remember that horrible horrible chick flick\""]
["03:28,740","03:32,620","\"I wonder I think spike it 3d is getting close to that\""]
["03:32,620","03:36,780","\"I don't know what I could probably sit through what's your number again over\""]
["03:36,780","03:43,880","\"Have you ever seen that movie with Johnny Depp and it's John Delder? No public\""]
["03:45,080","03:49,640","\"Public what was that called anyway that movie was fucking so boring me and my dad walked out of it\""]
["03:49,640","03:50,960","\"Oh, I\""]
["03:50,960","03:53,640","\"Don't think I ever walked out of like a theater for anything\""]
["03:53,640","03:58,020","\"I think that's one of the only times I ever did that I've probably done that twice in my life\""]
["03:58,020","04:03,040","\"And that was one of them. I've fallen asleep plenty of theaters, but I've never actually walked out\""]
["04:03,040","04:07,760","\"We might that was sitting there bored out of her fucking minds. I\""]
["04:07,760","04:11,080","\"Remember being in the theater for\""]
["04:13,160","04:19,560","\"I'm cabin in the woods and I was close to passing out because I got sick that day like unexpectedly\""]
["04:19,560","04:26,240","\"And so I was sitting there in the chair feeling really fucking miserable. That's a pretty entertaining first watch, but\""]
["04:26,240","04:31,040","\"I would say yes first watch and then after that it's like okay\""]
["04:31,040","04:36,000","\"We've seen the twists and the surprises. Yeah, you can't really enjoy it. Yeah, I got like yeah\""]
["04:36,000","04:41,440","\"That's a one-time after the after you've seen that movie once the only good part about it\""]
["04:41,440","04:44,240","\"You can go back and re-watch as the whole monster sequence.\""]
["04:44,240","04:44,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:44,740","04:49,440","\"That's like one of the shitty things about twist movies.\""]
["04:49,440","04:52,340","\"I still contend that there's...\""]
["04:52,340","04:57,440","\"You can enjoy a movie of gonna feel you know what the twist is if it's really like written well.\""]
["04:57,440","05:03,340","\"I put that to the test when I saw Psycho for the first time a couple years ago.\""]
["05:03,340","05:10,040","\"Everybody knows what happens in Psycho, but it was like I still was compelled\""]
["05:10,040","05:13,480","\"and you know, that was invested in the story\""]
["05:13,480","05:14,800","\"even though I knew I knew I was gonna happen.\""]
["05:14,800","05:17,080","\"- It's actually full of like interesting moments\""]
["05:17,080","05:19,160","\"rather than just twist shit over and over.\""]
["05:19,160","05:20,160","\"- Right.\""]
["05:20,160","05:24,120","\"- Well can we all agree if you had a 1,000 Heartless battle\""]
["05:24,120","05:26,000","\"in any of those movies,\""]
["05:26,000","05:28,000","\"they would suddenly become the best movies of all time.\""]
["05:28,000","05:29,160","\"- They would suddenly be very cool\""]
["05:29,160","05:32,160","\"if there was a thousand of the same Heartless.\""]
["05:32,160","05:34,920","\"- That you have to dispatch with the same--\""]
["05:34,920","05:37,360","\"- The kind that doesn't threaten you in any way.\""]
["05:37,360","05:39,000","\"- Did they actually code it so that when you kill\""]
["05:39,000","05:44,000","\"<coyote howl> yeah, that's cool.\""]
["05:44,000","05:49,880","\"spawns new ones in their place. Oh. But now like the whole screen is empty so\""]
["05:49,880","05:53,680","\"they must have been removing them. Yeah that's what I'm saying. It trades them\""]
["05:53,680","06:02,000","\"out. I like that a lot. Chris what's your favorite pre-rendered video game?\""]

["06:08,680","06:14,980","\"Okay, I like that I like the art style of Donkey Kong Country more than Yoshi's story\""]
["06:14,980","06:17,620","\"um, I would probably say\""]
["06:17,620","06:20,720","\"Donkey Kong Country 2\""]
