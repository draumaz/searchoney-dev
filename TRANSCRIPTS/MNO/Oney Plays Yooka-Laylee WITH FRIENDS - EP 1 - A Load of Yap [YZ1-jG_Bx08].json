["02:30,400","02:33,080","\"So that's the vice-presers of them\""]
["02:33,080","02:41,080","\"They really make a fucking game with unskippable cutscenes in 2017. It's just like Kingdom Hearts good fucking Christ\""]

["02:50,480","02:54,520","\"Never mind. They don't have the old one. How come all these guys are allowed to have small pupils?\""]
["02:54,520","02:56,800","\"But the main characters have to have big ugly ones\""]
["02:56,800","03:02,040","\"Because it's kitty because they're supposed to be scary Julian\""]
["03:02,040","03:09,760","\"Bajo Kazooie if you had lr and B you could skip you can make their pupils bigger. That's free Julian\""]
["03:09,760","03:12,960","\"It's the only\""]
["03:12,960","03:17,000","\"Fucking hate this so far I\""]
["03:17,400","03:22,320","\"You're not even playing a game. Yeah, I would like to it will fucking let me well listen\""]
["03:22,320","03:29,760","\"I mean since all we can do is look right now. I have to I have to clarify that I hated the art style for this game\""]
["03:29,760","03:33,600","\"Since the very fucking beginning. Yeah, I think it looks fine the same way\""]
["03:33,600","03:38,100","\"These these villain characters are the closest to being appealing\""]
["03:38,100","03:41,160","\"Everything else looks fucking appalling to me\""]
["03:41,160","03:43,680","\"Holy fuck\""]
["03:43,680","03:45,680","\"Julian's getting trouble\""]
["03:45,680","03:50,680","\"I'm gonna leave a comment and let Julian just let him know how wrong he is.\""]
["03:50,680","03:52,880","\"So evil man is evil is what I got from now.\""]
["03:52,880","03:54,680","\"Granted I wasn't reading.\""]
["03:54,680","03:57,080","\"Maybe he dropped something really important.\""]
["03:57,080","04:00,680","\"We'll see that's what the plot's about because he took the books.\""]
["04:00,680","04:02,680","\"Because now they can't read.\""]
["04:02,680","04:03,680","\"They like books.\""]
["04:03,680","04:04,680","\"I guess.\""]
["04:04,680","04:05,680","\"Okay.\""]
["04:05,680","04:06,680","\"Here he is Julian.\""]
["04:06,680","04:07,680","\"You don't think that looks good.\""]
["04:07,680","04:10,680","\"So they're gonna be, they're gonna jump around through books is what I'm guessing.\""]
["04:10,680","04:12,680","\"Make a joke about old video game.\""]
["04:12,680","04:14,680","\"I like how he sounds disgusted.\""]
["04:14,680","04:16,680","\"He's got a\""]
["04:16,680","04:20,160","\"That\""]
["04:20,160","04:22,160","\"Will punch the bat in the face I\""]
["04:22,160","04:27,680","\"Just there was a there was a character in banjo - who is a homo a flaming homo\""]
["04:27,680","04:32,040","\"That's exactly what their voice sounded like in it. You went yes, that's funny\""]
["04:32,040","04:36,800","\"I wonder if that's supposed to be the same thing. It's Dee Dee same chairs\""]
["04:36,800","04:42,560","\"It'll do great everybody will draw everybody will draw porn our people drawing. I have a check\""]
["04:42,560","04:45,600","\"I don't know. It's a gross looking character.\""]
["04:45,600","04:46,560","\"What, who which one?\""]
["04:46,560","04:47,620","\"Ball.\""]
["04:47,620","04:50,000","\"I don't think the green one looks good.\""]
["04:50,000","04:53,680","\"The green one's better. The eye's still ruined it, but it's better.\""]
["04:53,680","04:55,120","\"Tell me how you improve it.\""]
["04:55,120","04:57,760","\"Smaller pupils.\""]
["04:57,760","04:59,840","\"That's all. I wouldn't have thought to...\""]
["04:59,840","05:01,120","\"It's also a whole test.\""]
["05:01,120","05:03,760","\"I'm also just going to say it's not that interesting of a character.\""]
["05:03,760","05:08,640","\"I've seen a lot of fan art where they were they're slightly redesigned and they look a lot better.\""]
["05:08,640","05:09,440","\"Yes, I have to.\""]
["05:09,440","05:11,600","\"How would you make him more interesting?\""]
["05:11,600","05:16,140","\"I didn't think about that must fan earth. They made it look more interesting because they shaped the face more and everything\""]
["05:16,140","05:18,140","\"Yeah, they do more with it\""]
["05:18,140","05:23,320","\"Yes, dude, I get to play now that I feel Chris\""]
["05:23,320","05:30,360","\"That'd be really scary\""]
["05:30,360","05:40,520","\"I'm just gonna do this for the rest of the video. That's okay\""]
["05:40,520","05:42,520","\"*laughs*\""]
["05:42,520","05:43,120","\"Okay.\""]
["05:43,120","05:44,920","\"You know what actually seeing it in motion?\""]
["05:44,920","05:47,560","\"It doesn't look as terrible as I- as I-\""]
["05:47,560","05:48,560","\"It looks good!\""]
["05:48,560","05:49,560","\"As I thought from all the traits.\""]
["05:49,560","05:50,560","\"I think it's pretty.\""]
["05:50,560","05:52,280","\"I- I like the way he-\""]
["05:52,280","05:54,040","\"It's just the designs are really boring.\""]
["05:54,040","05:56,280","\"I like the way he leans and shit. It feels good.\""]
["05:56,280","06:00,120","\"The environment- I remember the environments looking really like aggressively like,\""]
["06:00,120","06:02,120","\"\"\"Oh look, we built this in unity.\"\"\""]
["06:02,120","06:03,800","\"No, it looks good to me.\""]
["06:03,800","06:08,920","\"And it looks a little- it's still not great, I think, but it's not bad.\""]
["06:08,920","06:10,440","\"I- I'm gonna say not bad.\""]
["06:10,440","06:11,720","\"What the fuck is this guy?\""]
["06:11,720","06:16,320","\"As if people fucking give a shit like what we think about games.\""]
["06:16,320","06:18,160","\"Yeah, that's true.\""]
["06:18,160","06:20,360","\"I mean, some of them do, but they shouldn't is my point.\""]
["06:20,360","06:21,920","\"Do you want to play our opinion?\""]
["06:21,920","06:24,520","\"I never played Banjo, so I don't have a fucking clue what to do.\""]
["06:24,520","06:26,960","\"They have played a bit.\""]
["06:26,960","06:29,520","\"You we did a big stream of banjo Kazooie.\""]
["06:29,520","06:30,760","\"Did you play this yet?\""]
["06:30,760","06:32,120","\"We didn't play this one.\""]
["06:32,120","06:34,320","\"I intentionally stayed away because I wanted to see.\""]
["06:34,320","06:36,680","\"I was like that they can spin around.\""]
["06:36,680","06:39,020","\"(screaming)\""]
["06:39,020","06:42,200","\"- Had you opened big chest?\""]
["06:42,200","06:43,200","\"- Am I kissing it?\""]
["06:43,200","06:45,920","\"- Ew.\""]
["06:45,920","06:46,920","\"- You're sucking on it.\""]
["06:46,920","06:47,760","\"- Oh.\""]
["06:47,760","06:48,600","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:48,600","06:50,000","\"- He is at home, oh, isn't he?\""]
["06:50,000","06:50,840","\"Probably.\""]
["06:50,840","06:54,360","\"- Home away like this.\""]
["06:54,360","06:55,200","\"- I like this.\""]
["06:55,200","06:56,560","\"- You're gonna do that.\""]
["06:56,560","06:59,040","\"- Yeah, what's the point?\""]
["06:59,040","07:02,040","\"Can you fly around with your little bat head?\""]
["07:05,240","07:11,040","\"So it doesn't control the same as you're supposed to be able to I'm gonna guess that you have to unlock that later\""]
["07:11,040","07:13,720","\"Which is weird you start with them banjo kazooie\""]
["07:13,720","07:17,600","\"Is there fall damage? Oh\""]
["07:17,600","07:24,540","\"We're there with their bottomless pits in banjo kazooie. I don't remember there being\""]
["07:24,540","07:27,640","\"You were in shorts\""]
["07:27,640","07:31,040","\"Get it like a trouser snake\""]
["07:34,040","07:40,640","\"I think he's not wait. He's got tiny pupils too. I was gonna say he's the only design. I think I kind of like\""]
["07:40,640","07:46,000","\"How could we just got tiny pupils? There's nothing else in this game like him from what I've seen\""]
["07:46,000","07:51,880","\"Yeah, what is it gonna? Yeah, he's fun. Yeah, the game should just be about him\""]
["07:51,880","07:55,840","\"How would he move?\""]
["07:55,840","07:57,680","\"very carefully\""]
["07:57,680","08:03,040","\"Hey Julian hey Chris if you could change one thing about you Kalele\""]
["08:03,440","08:05,440","\"What would it be?\""]
["08:05,440","08:14,300","\"The main characters. What would you do with them Julian? Make them look different. I might even just change the species\""]
["08:14,300","08:18,460","\"I don't know. I don't mind days of chameleon is just but they didn't do much with it\""]
["08:18,460","08:21,100","\"Yeah, it's probably\""]
["08:21,100","08:24,040","\"More interesting way to do it. What would you have done with it? Oh?\""]
["08:24,040","08:27,220","\"Banjo had clothes\""]
["08:27,220","08:30,300","\"You had a backpack that had the bird in it. You know what? That's a good point\""]
["08:30,300","08:34,580","\"I didn't even a lot of the things that I don't like about this are very like I\""]
["08:34,580","08:40,900","\"Don't know what the word would be there like they're like subtle things that you can't name right away, but if he I\""]
["08:40,900","08:46,120","\"Think if he had like clothes or a hat or like something no, he doesn't stand out\""]
["08:46,120","08:50,220","\"Like he seems like he would be a background character in a Pixar movie\""]
["08:50,220","08:56,260","\"You know what he looks like he looks like the stupid fucking chameleon from tangled. Yeah from tangled\""]
["08:56,260","09:03,260","\"I think even that has more too because at least that had facial expressions and everything.\""]
["09:03,260","09:05,620","\"That's a good point.\""]
["09:05,620","09:06,820","\"That's a very rigid face.\""]
["09:06,820","09:10,420","\"I can't see them animating anything interesting with it.\""]
["09:10,420","09:16,340","\"Okay well Julian, I don't want to rain on your parade but I think this is the best\""]
["09:16,340","09:17,340","\"game I've ever played.\""]
["09:17,340","09:19,580","\"You're not even playing it.\""]
["09:19,580","09:21,260","\"I don't know how to.\""]
["09:21,260","09:24,740","\"I like platformers like Crash because it's linear and you just get to a goal real quick.\""]
["09:24,740","09:29,940","\"I like Banjo-Kazooie a lot, and I'll say this too, because we just played it a few days\""]
["09:29,940","09:30,940","\"back.\""]
["09:30,940","09:31,940","\"It absolutely holds up.\""]
["09:31,940","09:35,420","\"It's still a lot of fun, still very enjoyable.\""]
["09:35,420","09:39,100","\"Even though it was really hard for me because it's just not good at video games.\""]
["09:39,100","09:43,500","\"I mean, it's probably weird adjusting to an N64 platformer like that anyways, because\""]
["09:43,500","09:44,860","\"you never played one before.\""]
["09:44,860","09:48,100","\"Yeah, I've never touched it before that.\""]
["09:48,100","09:51,260","\"And you threw me in on the fucking fifth level or something.\""]
["09:51,260","09:53,960","\"- What does this say?\""]
["09:53,960","09:56,260","\"- So this is their ship, are they pirates?\""]
["09:56,260","09:57,260","\"- I guess.\""]
["09:57,260","09:59,260","\"- They're batship crazy.\""]
["09:59,260","10:01,260","\"- People are gonna get mad that we didn't,\""]
["10:01,260","10:02,260","\"we skipped over the story.\""]
["10:02,260","10:03,260","\"I'm sorry everybody.\""]
["10:03,260","10:04,260","\"- We didn't skip it.\""]
["10:04,260","10:05,260","\"- Who gives a fuck?\""]
["10:05,260","10:06,260","\"- Well you didn't read it.\""]
["10:06,260","10:07,260","\"- They didn't let us skip it.\""]
["10:07,260","10:08,260","\"- You didn't read it.\""]
["10:08,260","10:10,260","\"They said it's a crashed ship and maybe there were some back\""]
["10:10,260","10:12,260","\"stories and we weren't paying attention to.\""]
["10:12,260","10:14,260","\"- That's what you try, that's what you get for trying to\""]
["10:14,260","10:15,260","\"deliver story through text.\""]
["10:15,260","10:18,260","\"- It's almost like this is just a bunch of people\""]
["10:18,260","10:20,260","\"casually sitting on a couch talking and playing a\""]
["10:20,260","10:25,260","\"and playing a video game, and it's not a big serious thing in any way.\""]
["10:25,260","10:29,260","\"Let me tell you people for the uninitiated,\""]
["10:29,260","10:34,260","\"there's a test that you can do for proper storytelling\""]
