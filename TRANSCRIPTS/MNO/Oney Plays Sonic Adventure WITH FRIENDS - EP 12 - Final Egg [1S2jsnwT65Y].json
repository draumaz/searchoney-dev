["01:25,000","01:29,040","\"That's so nice. I kind of keep it that way. They fucked up the same way with Wally to me.\""]
["01:29,040","01:35,200","\"I like the Wally the whole way. I think a lot of people I hear say, \"\"Yeah, it sucks once he gets on the show.\"\"\""]
["01:35,200","01:37,640","\"I don't think it sucks. I just, I liked it better when it was quiet.\""]
["01:37,640","01:41,280","\"Yeah, I'm the same way, but I don't mind it when it goes on the ship.\""]
["01:41,280","01:42,240","\"Yeah, no, it's fine.\""]
["01:42,240","01:47,800","\"But the opening is much stronger and it's sad to see happily in. It just drops it completely.\""]
["01:47,800","01:52,400","\"Also, I liked the way it was showing real humans and then it shows the dumb cartoon ones.\""]
["01:52,400","01:54,320","\"Oh, that bugs you?\""]
["01:54,320","01:56,880","\"Yeah, cuz it shows both and it's like what just weird\""]

["02:09,680","02:11,680","\"Well the humming was overly realistic\""]
["02:11,680","02:15,320","\"He looked like a robot, but it's real life\""]
["02:15,320","02:21,320","\"You know like those real I want to see somebody try to make Wally look creepy\""]
["02:22,520","02:24,520","\"Sonic look really realistic\""]

["02:28,960","02:33,060","\"Who's very creepy like the real tall hedgehogs you see on the street?\""]
["02:33,060","02:35,560","\"What's wrong with them to do it?\""]
["02:35,560","02:37,680","\"blue\""]
["02:37,680","02:43,160","\"What does that refer to in creepy past is when they say that kind of thing and it's like a fictional character that doesn't exist in\""]
["02:43,160","02:46,400","\"Any way in real life. What's that a comparison to by saying it looks realistic?\""]
["02:46,400","02:50,360","\"- They want you to think of like when that guy did all those\""]
["02:50,360","02:53,240","\"photoshops of like cartoon characters and they-\""]
["02:53,240","02:55,080","\"- That just looks funny.\""]

["03:01,120","03:01,960","\"- I like-\""]
["03:01,960","03:03,400","\"- There was a realistic Homer in front of me\""]

["03:12,160","03:15,080","\"was trying to scare you if it was a spooky possess Simpsons?\""]
["03:15,080","03:17,880","\"Do you know they're gonna do a treehouse of horror in Dead Bar and it's gonna be you.\""]
["03:17,880","03:19,960","\"I don't think they're gonna do it at some point.\""]
["03:19,960","03:20,960","\"They might.\""]
["03:20,960","03:21,960","\"They might.\""]
["03:21,960","03:26,800","\"I'd be happy because at least they know that it exists but at the same time it would be\""]
["03:26,800","03:28,240","\"fucking 10 years too late.\""]
["03:28,240","03:30,120","\"Did you see the Pokemon Go song they did?\""]
["03:30,120","03:31,120","\"I sure did.\""]
["03:31,120","03:32,800","\"I think that was the worst thing they've ever done.\""]
["03:32,800","03:33,800","\"By the way he looks great here.\""]
["03:33,800","03:34,800","\"He was really embarrassing.\""]
["03:34,800","03:35,800","\"Yes.\""]
["03:35,800","03:36,800","\"Yes it was.\""]
["03:36,800","03:37,800","\"It was really bad.\""]
["03:37,800","03:39,200","\"You were telling us it got better.\""]
["03:39,200","03:40,200","\"What?\""]
["03:40,200","03:41,760","\"You're telling us the show got better.\""]
["03:41,760","03:45,040","\"No it keeps going through weird spouts where it goes from really bad and it'll have\""]
["03:45,040","03:48,600","\"have like one or two really good episodes and then just back to being shit again. It\""]
["03:48,600","03:50,040","\"just depends on the writer.\""]
["03:50,040","03:55,880","\"Well, they were on point with that biting satire of Pokémon Go.\""]
["03:55,880","04:00,600","\"I mean, you know how violent Pokémon Go is.\""]
["04:00,600","04:01,600","\"It's true.\""]
["04:01,600","04:05,600","\"That was seriously just uninformed and awful.\""]
["04:05,600","04:10,840","\"It's a bad thing, I guess, except no one's playing it anymore anyways because a show like\""]
["04:10,840","04:14,520","\"that can't really comment on anything current because it takes too long.\""]
["04:14,520","04:18,600","\"The Simpsons does this weird thing where they upload previews to their YouTube channel\""]
["04:18,600","04:19,600","\"with no sound.\""]
["04:19,600","04:20,600","\"Yeah, with that, with no sound.\""]
["04:20,600","04:21,600","\"With scratch audio.\""]
["04:21,600","04:25,360","\"So there's no mixing, no sound, and it's really creepy and weird.\""]
["04:25,360","04:27,400","\"It's because they, I think they just rush it up there.\""]
["04:27,400","04:29,960","\"Like they're still doing the sound design for the episode at the time.\""]
["04:29,960","04:31,240","\"No, yeah, that's it.\""]
["04:31,240","04:33,200","\"But they shouldn't do that.\""]
["04:33,200","04:35,240","\"It's weird to see that happen sometimes on TV.\""]
["04:35,240","04:40,000","\"I remember Rick and Morty aired and the colors were messed up and the audio mixing was weird\""]
["04:40,000","04:45,580","\"Because they got like an earlier version of the episode that they put on air\""]
["04:45,580","04:51,040","\"So they corrected it with the later earrings as well, but that kind of thing can happen sometimes\""]
["04:51,040","04:57,500","\"Yeah, it's a it's weird. Holy shit. What I made me nervous. I thought you were gonna fall. It's automatic\""]
["04:57,500","05:00,280","\"It's automatic\""]
["05:00,280","05:05,840","\"It's just so like I saw an episode where Bart goes to the future or something or to the past and\""]
["05:06,640","05:12,340","\"It's a shitty games that suck ass. It's a you it's a clip on YouTube and there's no sound and it's really awkward and creepy\""]
["05:12,340","05:18,440","\"It's like him going through a time portal. There's no sound the whole video pretty much. That's it. I'm not kidding\""]
["05:18,440","05:22,400","\"I supposed to be screaming, but it's dead silent. That's like whoa dude\""]
["05:22,400","05:28,000","\"This is crazy. He'll like walk silently up to a portal step inside of it. He's at it. Why is this an episode?\""]
["05:28,000","05:31,760","\"Is this tree house of horror? Oh mom and dad are dead\""]
["05:32,120","05:36,480","\"My dad are dead and I am dead Bart. I am a bad boy\""]
["05:36,480","05:41,920","\"I was thought it was kind of funny that Nancy Cartwright calls people off his Bart. Just like doing Scientology\""]
["05:41,920","05:44,440","\"And then they get really mad at her\""]
["05:44,440","05:47,440","\"Can't do that don't have a cow\""]
["05:47,440","05:57,640","\"I would join the bar called me I would join at the boss baby called whoa, you know, I saw the boss baby\""]
["05:57,640","06:00,360","\"I thought it was okay. I heard I heard. Oh, I thought was pretty good\""]
["06:00,360","06:02,360","\"What did I like about the boss, baby?\""]
["06:02,360","06:05,800","\"There's a lot of\""]
["06:05,800","06:07,800","\"Funny jokes\""]
["06:07,800","06:15,800","\"That's a very cold it's a very casual reaction. I don't know I thought the humor was consistently funny all the way through the baby\""]
["06:15,800","06:22,720","\"It speaks I can adult, but it's not I could believe oh fuck. Oh my no\""]
["06:22,720","06:27,360","\"I could believe that the movie is funnier than it looks it is no\""]
["06:27,360","06:29,820","\"Probably just a shitty premise it it well\""]
["06:29,820","06:35,300","\"Yeah, but they make it creative. I don't know. I mean you were trying to sell me on kangaroo Jack\""]
["06:35,300","06:40,120","\"No, I wasn't trying to sell you on it. I said Matt and Ryan showed me and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be\""]
["06:40,120","06:44,820","\"It was good. It was okay. I don't think I don't think Sam right Jack\""]
["06:44,820","06:48,620","\"Kingaroo Jack should be in Sam right Jack\""]
["06:48,620","06:52,500","\"He should be in the finale. I think the reason people so many people hate Sam\""]
["06:53,740","06:55,740","\"-Canger root Jack! -Jesus Julian!\""]
["06:55,740","06:57,540","\"-The reason so many people hate... -Severing Jack!\""]

["07:11,980","07:16,140","\"-Yeah, but I don't know. -So it's probably fine as a movie.\""]
