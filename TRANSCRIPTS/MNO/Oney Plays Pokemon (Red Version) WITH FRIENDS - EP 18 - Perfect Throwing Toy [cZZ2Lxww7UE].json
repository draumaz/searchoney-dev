["00:48,800","00:56,260","\"stupid it's because they programmed it like a piece of shit so no oh my god\""]

["01:08,280","01:13,440","\"It's cuz I keep expecting it to cancel the other day. We started on the beebut\""]

["01:44,860","01:48,080","\"What you're obsessed with booger, man\""]
["01:51,640","01:53,640","\"You're gonna write your teeth\""]
["01:53,640","01:58,740","\"No, they did a study if you pour coca cola into\""]
["01:58,740","02:06,640","\"frying into your urethra and you fry up the coca cola. Yeah, it gets dry and hard\""]
["02:06,640","02:12,420","\"Did you know that you'll have to scrape it off? That's what it does inside your body. Did you know it's?\""]
["02:12,420","02:19,640","\"Hundreds of degrees in your stomach. You know if you pour a coca cola diet version on a beating human heart I\""]
["02:21,160","02:24,120","\"Don't know how you're gonna do that it makes the present\""]
["02:24,120","02:35,280","\"That would probably feel really weird having a tickling sensation on your heart someone just does open heart surgery and poor\""]
["02:35,280","02:41,360","\"They did that okay. That was a sign filled up a so they spilled it by exit\""]
["02:41,360","02:45,160","\"What oh whoopsie is that a really sign filled up? Yeah, they drop a pack of\""]
["02:45,160","02:48,440","\"Thin mints into some guy during surgery by accident\""]
["02:50,040","02:55,640","\"That's pretty good. I would prefer the die-coke plot. Don't wait. Did you deposit the HM? Yeah, we don't need it\""]
["02:55,640","02:58,460","\"Yes, we do we don't have cut you used it already. No, I didn't\""]

["03:14,940","03:17,040","\"or\""]
["03:17,040","03:25,160","\"- I guess Gary's little stink would probably be the best idea right now since he's part ground.\""]
["03:25,160","03:26,160","\"- Seems little.\""]
["03:26,160","03:28,200","\"- I'm coming to call him little stink.\""]
["03:28,200","03:30,200","\"- Do you like a...\""]
["03:30,200","03:32,640","\"- Should I be leveling up somebody or what?\""]
["03:32,640","03:35,040","\"- Oh yeah, you should be leveling up a scrimbin.\""]
["03:35,040","03:37,120","\"- Okay, we want to get them already.\""]
["03:37,120","03:38,520","\"- Our way.\""]
["03:38,520","03:39,520","\"How do you evolve them?\""]
["03:39,520","03:40,520","\"Is it by trading?\""]
["03:40,520","03:41,520","\"- We're...\""]
["03:41,520","03:42,520","\"- How do you get Alex?\""]
["03:42,520","03:45,840","\"- I think we probably need to get, yeah, trade Alex Sam is trading.\""]
["03:45,840","03:47,840","\"Really? What? Why?\""]
["03:47,840","03:48,840","\"Why?\""]
["03:48,840","03:49,840","\"Why, um...\""]
["03:49,840","03:50,840","\"Uh, well, okay.\""]
["03:50,840","03:51,840","\"You want your notes, right?\""]
["03:51,840","03:54,840","\"Yes, and I left him at the, uh...\""]
["03:54,840","03:55,840","\"Ow.\""]
["03:55,840","03:56,840","\"The trainer.\""]
["03:56,840","03:58,840","\"Why does Nkadabra evolve into Alakazam?\""]
["03:58,840","03:59,840","\"Yeah, trade.\""]
["03:59,840","04:00,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:00,840","04:01,840","\"You have to trade.\""]
["04:01,840","04:02,840","\"Yes.\""]
["04:02,840","04:03,840","\"Why?\""]
["04:03,840","04:05,840","\"It's a stupid gimmick they introduced to...\""]
["04:05,840","04:06,840","\"It's not like they introduced it.\""]
["04:06,840","04:07,840","\"Well, how come Abra...\""]
["04:07,840","04:09,840","\"It evolves into Nkadabra?\""]
["04:09,840","04:10,840","\"It was a starting thing.\""]
["04:10,840","04:12,840","\"When I say introduce, I mean, they...\""]
["04:12,840","04:17,840","\"I think they were even mentioning in an interview that originally that wasn't in there\""]
["04:17,840","04:22,840","\"They put that in later on just because it's like oh, I gotta give justification to training\""]
["04:22,840","04:26,840","\"I thought that was there's no actual way to evolve to that\""]
["04:26,840","04:27,840","\"No, what?\""]
["04:27,840","04:31,840","\"I thought that was the whole idea of Pokemon to start out with was the whole training thing\""]
["04:31,840","04:32,840","\"No\""]
["04:32,840","04:39,840","\"I mean it was a big emphasis like why they wanted this to be a thing but wasn't supposed to be enforced originally like that\""]
["04:40,840","04:43,240","\"But they really confusing they put that in\""]
["04:43,240","04:48,120","\"So the only way to get alicazam in this game is to find an NPC with it\""]
["04:48,120","04:50,040","\"No\""]
["04:50,040","04:54,440","\"What you trade with other people like players. Well, how do they get alicazam?\""]
["04:54,440","05:00,920","\"No, as in like when you trade it he evolves. Yeah, I know they trade it back. So how are you gonna do that?\""]
["05:00,920","05:06,760","\"Uh, we have a gameboy with us with red version. So we could trade to that\""]
["05:06,760","05:09,480","\"That's weird. Wait, what level is it?\""]
["05:09,880","05:11,880","\"Let's see\""]
["05:11,880","05:18,540","\"Well, bright Watson. How's he doing? He's dead. He's level 11. He's halfway there put him back\""]
["05:18,540","05:25,980","\"Put him back. Where do you want me to go? I put him back and let's let's get our Bulbasaur going\""]
["05:25,980","05:28,580","\"You want me to just grind?\""]
["05:28,580","05:32,600","\"No\""]
["05:32,600","05:34,600","\"For a little bit I guess okay\""]
["05:36,440","05:39,780","\"Let me see is there any area that we can actually go to right now\""]
["05:39,780","05:44,740","\"Gary's mod just go fight the gym leader\""]
["05:44,740","05:47,460","\"Yeah, sure\""]
["05:47,460","05:52,380","\"Well, I will I mean the thing about that is yeah, it's that we want to take as many steps as possible\""]
["05:52,380","05:56,020","\"Because that's how that's how the daycare\""]
["05:56,020","06:00,780","\"Trainers at the gym. Well, why don't you just like progressively far into the game and come back later?\""]
["06:00,780","06:05,740","\"Because by then I won't matter like we're not gonna need them anymore. Why do you need them?\""]
["06:05,740","06:11,500","\"Okay, you know what it's because Gyarados is a powerful Pokemon to have early on go to the gym and keep doing a switch between\""]
["06:11,500","06:15,660","\"Gary's mod and a little\""]
["06:15,660","06:20,940","\"We got magic herp is brat Watson. I love the graphics on the houses in the hoops\""]
["06:20,940","06:27,180","\"Boop as ugly as a lot of like the pok√©mon sprites are and everything there's a turn to yeah\""]
["06:27,180","06:31,820","\"I mean like I like how simple it is it's it's super rudimentary, but like\""]
["06:31,820","06:34,620","\"the it's appealing yeah\""]
["06:35,500","06:40,860","\"Probably do a great deal to nostalgia, but I like it.\""]
["06:40,860","06:43,100","\"I liked what's his name?\""]
["06:43,100","06:45,100","\"Ken Sugimori.\""]
["06:45,100","06:49,100","\"I always say that watercolor stuff was so much fun.\""]
["06:49,100","06:51,100","\"Yeah, I love a lot of the original stuff.\""]
["06:51,100","06:53,900","\"I hate that he switches the digital stuff.\""]
["06:53,900","06:55,500","\"I don't think it looks as fun.\""]
["06:55,500","06:57,740","\"It's also the way he draws characters now,\""]
["06:57,740","07:00,300","\"they all have the same face and body.\""]
["07:00,300","07:02,300","\"Everyone is super skinny now.\""]
["07:02,300","07:04,300","\"They all have the same face.\""]
["07:04,300","07:09,060","\"Oh, the care like human characters. I mean when I was a really small kid. I used to love the watercolor art\""]
["07:09,060","07:16,300","\"It's just so cool. I look the coolest thing too was the original toy line that they had the little plastic toys\""]
["07:16,300","07:18,300","\"You could get used to reflect it\""]
["07:18,300","07:24,020","\"Yeah, they they paint them in a way to make them look similar to the water. Yeah, so Pikachu was exactly like that\""]
["07:24,020","07:28,940","\"Yeah, yeah, it was cool. I had it, you know, I\""]
["07:29,820","07:34,980","\"I really liked all of those they didn't bring all of them over here either. I remember Gengar was also see through\""]
["07:34,980","07:37,880","\"Yeah, I had that one I had a lot of those little figures\""]
["07:37,880","07:41,980","\"I only had a handful because only the stores near me didn't sell all of them\""]
["07:41,980","07:46,500","\"My mom used to sell them in her store except they were China versions that were\""]
["07:46,500","07:49,340","\"pirate I there was\""]
["07:49,340","07:56,100","\"There's a little place that was like an hour off from her house and they had Japanese import toys\""]
["07:56,100","07:58,660","\"and we had like Dragon Ball Z stuff we got there and\""]
["07:58,660","08:04,800","\"And they had a poor egon. I also had a poor egon. Yeah, my favorites from this generation\""]
["08:04,800","08:07,800","\"I had the knockoff version of poor egon, but he looked like fucking garbage\""]
["08:07,800","08:12,340","\"I remember the worst figure I had was chairmander and he had I know it's weird on screen\""]
["08:12,340","08:19,060","\"Yeah, he had this um I had the official chairmander to I got after but the the pirate or the fucking knockoff version\""]
["08:19,060","08:21,600","\"I had his fire on his tail was just a cone\""]
["08:21,600","08:23,720","\"It was terrible\""]
["08:23,720","08:30,080","\"He was completely dark red. I remember we had a Charmander toy, but I think I got it from something weird like a cereal box\""]
["08:30,080","08:34,000","\"Hmm so he I remember he was pure red like he was a yeah\""]
["08:34,000","08:40,600","\"Oh, maybe maybe that's what it was. I had guard dose as a figure. He had a little green thing at the bottom that balanced him\""]
["08:40,600","08:44,400","\"I remember that I remember my favorite ones\""]
["08:44,400","08:49,300","\"I had a match up my little matchamp and he looked like fuck did you ever have the bouncy balls that were see-through?\""]
["08:49,300","08:52,840","\"And there's a little I did I had one hand. Did you cut it open? No?\""]
["08:52,840","08:57,660","\"- I, I'd not on purpose. It had like, it was the,\""]
["08:57,660","09:00,700","\"I bounced it around a lot, so I got a lot of wear and tear.\""]
["09:00,700","09:02,100","\"And you know, they'd have like the,\""]
["09:02,100","09:03,500","\"they'd get little notches in them\""]
["09:03,500","09:06,980","\"and I'd just start picking at it because I was a nervous kid\""]
["09:06,980","09:08,620","\"and I always needed to do something with my hands.\""]
["09:08,620","09:10,860","\"- I immediately bought it because they had one\""]
["09:10,860","09:12,980","\"with Mewtwo in the middle of it.\""]
["09:12,980","09:15,900","\"And I, because it makes it look bigger\""]
["09:15,900","09:17,660","\"because of what they made it with.\""]
["09:17,660","09:19,420","\"I saw, I was like, \"\"Holy shit,\""]
["09:19,420","09:21,620","\"there's a giant Mewtwo figure in there.\"\"\""]
["09:21,620","09:24,060","\"And then you cut it open. It's just really, really tiny.\""]
["09:24,060","09:28,580","\"But everyone I knew did that. Everyone who had those bouncy balls cut them up in two.\""]
["09:28,580","09:31,780","\"I had a knockoff mute. That looked pretty good.\""]
["09:31,780","09:33,140","\"It was white, though.\""]
["09:33,140","09:36,340","\"They made an official mutoid. I remember because I had one later on.\""]
["09:36,340","09:39,620","\"I don't think I had mutoo. I had squirtle.\""]
["09:39,620","09:42,300","\"I had IV sore.\""]
["09:42,300","09:44,940","\"Geez, I had a...\""]
["09:44,940","09:48,740","\"I remember I got one the Japanese. They came in like boxes.\""]
["09:48,740","09:49,620","\"I drag and I...\""]
["09:50,140","09:54,420","\"The box one I got had Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, and Venusaur in it.\""]
["09:54,420","09:59,140","\"I had fucking... I had Ash, but he was stiff, and he held his hand up with the Pokemon.\""]
["09:59,140","10:01,140","\"Oh yeah, I remember that was a set too.\""]
["10:01,140","10:05,420","\"I hated playing with it, because he was just a stiff ass statue that you couldn't bend.\""]
["10:05,420","10:07,140","\"I remember I was just...\""]
["10:07,140","10:10,540","\"That's what you describe as a perfect throwing toy.\""]
["10:10,540","10:13,140","\"You throw it at people because you can't do anything.\""]
["10:13,140","10:15,140","\"It's nice and big and it hurts.\""]
["10:15,140","10:18,140","\"I had knockoff Jessie and James, they were really badly painted.\""]
["10:18,140","10:19,860","\"Her hair was too dark.\""]
["10:19,860","10:24,020","\"But I remember with how they painted the one of Ash,\""]
["10:24,020","10:26,260","\"the paint would very easily come off.\""]
["10:26,260","10:27,540","\"His blue vest, yeah.\""]
["10:27,540","10:30,020","\"Yeah, so it started looking like he was just coming undressed.\""]
["10:30,020","10:30,540","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:30,540","10:32,860","\"Yeah, so weird.\""]
["10:32,860","10:36,780","\"I'm trying to remember all the ones I had because they got a lot of plate time.\""]
["10:36,780","10:37,540","\"You know what I'm saying?\""]
["10:37,540","10:38,340","\"Plate time.\""]
["10:38,340","10:40,340","\"But a few in my ass, you know what I'm saying, Joey?\""]
["10:40,340","10:41,660","\"I was just going to make that joke.\""]
["10:41,660","10:43,540","\"I was going to be the funny man.\""]
["10:43,540","10:46,300","\"What would be the best Pokemon toy to shove in your ass, Julian?\""]
