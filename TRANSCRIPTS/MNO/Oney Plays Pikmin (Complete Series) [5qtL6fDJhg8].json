["01:48:03,640","01:48:09,940","\"And then it gets to the ending and I was anticipating it and everything and when it came I just remember thinking like holy shit\""]
["01:48:09,940","01:48:14,960","\"Okay as as much as I've been warned about this. It's still awful\""]
["01:48:14,960","01:48:20,960","\"Seeds it I didn't know it was that bad. That's terrible. It's oh my god, and it keeps going too\""]

["01:48:30,480","01:48:34,880","\"Wouldn't mind that either because Julian I remember you were saying like your roommate was complaining\""]

["01:49:24,400","01:49:29,440","\"Yeah, he's a little over emotional\""]
["01:49:29,440","01:49:32,720","\"and he lashes out and goes kubunanos a lot of the time\""]
["01:49:32,720","01:49:35,620","\"but at the same time too, it's justified.\""]
["01:49:36,680","01:49:38,680","\"given what he thinks the situation is.\""]

["01:50:35,500","01:50:42,340","\"Think this is what I've just been realizing because I don't really care much for superhero movies is the less it feels like a superhero movie\""]

["01:50:44,340","01:50:44,980","\"and\""]
["01:50:44,980","01:50:50,360","\"I think that's why Iron Man kind of worked because the first half doesn't necessarily feel like a superhero movie\""]
["01:50:50,360","01:50:51,260","\"Yeah\""]
["01:50:51,260","01:50:56,620","\"And that's another thing is in a lot of like superhero movies the movie usually gets boring once they get their powers\""]

["01:51:07,740","01:51:10,460","\"So maybe that was very straight and direct but\""]
["01:51:10,460","01:51:13,820","\"That was one of the few times I really enjoyed\""]

["01:51:22,100","01:51:27,620","\"Yeah, it's super goofy, but it's super good. I love that movie how I feel about it is\""]
["01:51:28,300","01:51:33,660","\"When the Avengers first came out it was a really funny movie and it was like wow superheroes are funny\""]

["01:51:45,140","01:51:49,180","\"And now I don't really care anymore because it doesn't seem like a big situation\""]
["01:51:49,180","01:51:54,500","\"But like I don't know if they don't do that then usually they come off really drool and boring\""]
