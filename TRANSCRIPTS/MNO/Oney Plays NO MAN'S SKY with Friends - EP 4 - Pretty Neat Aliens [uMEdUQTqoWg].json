["01:38,260","01:40,260","\"We're really far from the ship.\""]
["01:40,260","01:41,560","\"And our shield is down.\""]
["01:41,560","01:42,760","\"Can we name some stuff?\""]
["01:42,760","01:43,760","\"Yeah.\""]

["02:17,860","02:19,860","\"Oh, god, nevermind.\""]
["02:19,860","02:23,860","\"That sucks.\""]
["02:23,860","02:25,860","\"It's so hard to hit.\""]
["02:25,860","02:27,860","\"It sucks that you gotta kill things to get things.\""]
["02:27,860","02:28,860","\"Where'd it go?\""]
["02:28,860","02:30,860","\"Oh my god, the FOV.\""]
["02:30,860","02:37,860","\"You think if they zoom the FOV out would like just make the game glitchy and unplayable?\""]
["02:37,860","02:39,860","\"Get out of there and Sentinel, dude!\""]
["02:39,860","02:40,860","\"Why is it hating me so much?\""]
["02:40,860","02:42,860","\"I don't think it likes when you kill things.\""]
["02:42,860","02:44,860","\"There's sentinels everywhere.\""]
["02:44,860","02:46,860","\"Every time you land on the planet, they're just everywhere.\""]
["02:46,860","02:50,560","\"That's the one thing I don't like about this game is you can kill them though.\""]
["02:50,560","02:52,780","\"You never land on a planet that seems different.\""]
["02:52,780","02:57,460","\"It's always just like it looks different but it still has sentinels, it still has like\""]
["02:57,460","03:00,800","\"outposts, it still has all the same shit as every other planet.\""]
["03:00,800","03:03,300","\"So nothing ever feels new.\""]
["03:03,300","03:06,740","\"See I got it.\""]

["03:14,940","03:16,540","\"Born in Raish and Ireland.\""]
["03:16,540","03:20,540","\"We, look at go.\""]
["03:20,540","03:25,260","\"This is the most fun part of the game so far.\""]
["03:25,260","03:26,580","\"It got a journey milestone.\""]
["03:26,580","03:27,420","\"Wow.\""]
["03:27,420","03:30,900","\"What do you think of the Fez music?\""]
["03:30,900","03:32,060","\"So beautiful.\""]

["03:48,380","03:55,700","\"My gosh shut I know I know I know many milestone. It doesn't let you do shit when the stupid screen comes up\""]
["03:55,700","04:04,780","\"There's a whole you know fuck it who gives a shit who cares Julian\""]
["04:04,780","04:09,380","\"Don't need to be nasty\""]
["04:09,940","04:17,660","\"Look more ships. You're alone in this huge universe yet every planet has ships and sentinels. Don't kill Bulby\""]
["04:17,660","04:27,580","\"He spun out\""]
["04:27,580","04:29,580","\"(mimics a \"\"GURRRRRRRR\"\" sound)\""]
["04:29,580","04:31,580","\"(laughs)\""]
["04:31,580","04:33,580","\"Technology, recharge.\""]
["04:33,580","04:37,580","\"Mmm, I need to change.\""]
["04:37,580","04:41,580","\"You did it?\""]

["04:42,580","04:43,580","\"You want to play?\""]
["04:43,580","04:44,580","\"Okay.\""]
["04:44,580","04:46,580","\"Let's go to the next planet, yo.\""]
["04:46,580","04:50,580","\"Look, I got a journey milestone.\""]
["04:50,580","04:54,580","\"Like, I really just want to fly down right over it.\""]
["04:54,580","04:55,780","\"I don't want to do them.\""]
["04:55,780","04:56,780","\"I know.\""]
["04:56,780","05:00,380","\"I just want to like I want to just barely dodge it.\""]
["05:00,380","05:01,380","\"Can you show that by the way?\""]
["05:01,380","05:03,180","\"Can you show that you can't actually get near anything?\""]
["05:03,180","05:05,940","\"Like this is as close to shit as I can get.\""]
["05:05,940","05:06,940","\"It fights against you.\""]
["05:06,940","05:08,340","\"It doesn't want you to get close to anything.\""]
["05:08,340","05:09,740","\"It's just like push you back up.\""]
["05:09,740","05:10,740","\"Yeah.\""]

["05:11,740","05:12,740","\"It's kind of dumb.\""]
["05:12,740","05:13,740","\"Like this is fun to dodge shit like that.\""]
["05:13,740","05:14,740","\"That would have been so fun.\""]
["05:14,740","05:17,020","\"Is there like a way to boost or anything right now?\""]
["05:17,020","05:18,020","\"Well then circle.\""]
["05:18,020","05:22,060","\"So try boosting and then get really close to something like hug the ground as close\""]
["05:22,060","05:23,620","\"as you can and then try to hit it all.\""]
["05:23,620","05:25,620","\"I'm gonna try and fly into the ground, okay?\""]
["05:25,620","05:29,760","\"There we go\""]
["05:29,760","05:32,740","\"Nope, it's pushes you back up\""]
["05:32,740","05:38,460","\"You don't want to have too much fun. I want to try and hit this structure right here. Oh\""]
["05:38,460","05:47,400","\"Okay, these came. Why does the why does the grand texture keep changing colors? I don't know. That's how it deals\""]
["05:47,400","05:50,220","\"It's that\""]
["05:50,220","05:52,220","\"Where's my my feet?\""]
