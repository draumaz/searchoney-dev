["00:04,500","00:05,500","\"[DING]\""]
["00:05,500","00:07,500","\"Flying around is a lot of fun, huh?\""]
["00:07,500","00:08,000","\"It is.\""]
["00:08,000","00:09,500","\"It's too bad you don't have a football game.\""]
["00:09,500","00:11,500","\"Let me save before we do this.\""]
["00:11,500","00:12,500","\"Make sure I have items.\""]
["00:12,500","00:14,500","\"All the movement you get at the end is really fun.\""]
["00:14,500","00:15,500","\"[DING]\""]
["00:15,500","00:16,500","\"[DING]\""]
["00:16,500","00:18,500","\"That's something I don't understand about sequels,\""]
["00:18,500","00:21,000","\"when they take away all the moves you learned in the first game.\""]
["00:21,000","00:23,500","\"I don't get it like how they did it here.\""]
["00:23,500","00:27,500","\"Why is Glide a thing that you have to get through your final form being leveled up all the way?\""]
["00:27,500","00:29,500","\"That's-- you don't need it at that point.\""]
["00:29,500","00:30,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:30,500","00:37,100","\"If I ever make a video game and then make a sequel to the video game, I'll make sure\""]
["00:37,100","00:40,620","\"the start of the second game has everything from the first game.\""]
["00:40,620","00:43,380","\"It's good because then you can utilize that into the design.\""]
["00:43,380","00:44,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:44,380","00:45,380","\"You could actually design areas around it.\""]
["00:45,380","00:49,020","\"And people who pick up the sequel and don't know how to play go buy the first when you\""]
["00:49,020","00:50,380","\"piece of shit.\""]
["00:50,380","00:53,180","\"I can understand it for Kingdom Hearts though that they start you over.\""]
["00:53,180","00:57,700","\"Alright, I don't know how much of it got left in to the stuff that went up.\""]
["00:57,700","01:01,700","\"We did try Marloosha a couple times.\""]
["01:01,700","01:05,300","\"Let's see if I can actually beat him this time.\""]
["01:05,300","01:09,900","\"I just think from the standpoint where it means you can add more new shit to the sequel\""]
["01:09,900","01:11,700","\"as well as the stuff you have from the first game.\""]
["01:11,700","01:12,700","\"No, that's true.\""]
["01:12,700","01:13,700","\"Because you're just unlocking the same shit.\""]
["01:13,700","01:14,700","\"Yeah, it's true.\""]
["01:14,700","01:16,860","\"Would you worry about power creep then at that point though if you're going to be adding\""]
["01:16,860","01:17,860","\"new stuff?\""]
["01:17,860","01:20,700","\"I mean yeah, you'll have to seriously balance everything.\""]
["01:20,700","01:26,420","\"I say it's just an issue with RPGs though because you have no talent to bake retarded\""]
["01:26,420","01:46,420","\"I don't mean for Kingdom Hearts.\""]
["01:46,420","01:49,420","\"I mean for Glide, I think they should have given you two way earlier.\""]
["01:49,420","01:50,420","\"Glide, why should it have been worth anything?\""]
["01:50,420","01:51,420","\"For other games, they can-\""]
["01:51,420","01:54,420","\"At the very least, like maybe halfway through the game or something like that.\""]
["01:54,420","01:56,940","\"They can have new challenges or levels that are different.\""]
["01:56,940","02:01,420","\"They weren't in the first game as well, so they can do that as well.\""]
["02:01,420","02:03,260","\"No, no, this.\""]
["02:03,260","02:05,060","\"Oh, remember, reflect.\""]
["02:05,060","02:06,220","\"Yeah, there you go.\""]
["02:06,220","02:08,060","\"Reflected the good.\""]
["02:08,060","02:10,260","\"They killed both of your team.\""]
["02:10,260","02:12,900","\"Oh, yeah, they are dead.\""]
["02:12,900","02:13,400","\"Oh, whoops.\""]
["02:13,400","02:15,100","\"That's not the one I meant to do.\""]
["02:15,100","02:16,460","\"I meant to do Qor.\""]
["02:16,460","02:18,100","\"Oh, I always think that's so scary.\""]
["02:18,100","02:19,180","\"Oh, why would you glide around these?\""]
["02:19,180","02:21,940","\"When they lock to you like that.\""]
["02:21,940","02:24,220","\"Oh, shit.\""]
["02:24,220","02:26,220","\"Do the thing already, so this thing.\""]
["02:26,220","02:27,680","\"Yeah, get him.\""]
["02:27,680","02:29,220","\"Oh, I wasn't close enough.\""]
["02:29,220","02:30,500","\"Oh, shit.\""]
["02:30,500","02:31,660","\"Hey, guys.\""]
["02:31,660","02:32,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:32,400","02:33,780","\"I love you.\""]
["02:33,780","02:38,260","\"Thank you, Chris, for playing video games with us all this time.\""]
["02:38,260","02:38,600","\"Thank you.\""]
["02:38,600","02:39,420","\"It's been a lot of fun.\""]
["02:39,420","02:41,860","\"Thank you as the proper response to \"\"I love you.\"\"\""]
["02:41,860","02:44,980","\"I know.\""]
["02:44,980","02:47,420","\"I love you, babe.\""]
["02:47,420","02:48,220","\"Thank you.\""]
["02:48,220","02:48,920","\"Thanks.\""]
["02:48,920","02:54,200","\"Needs some oblivious idiot who accidentally got married and didn't realize.\""]
["02:54,200","02:56,200","\"I'm not sure if you can get some of the cards.\""]
["02:56,200","02:57,200","\"Shut up.\""]
["02:57,200","02:58,200","\"Shut up.\""]
["02:58,200","02:59,200","\"Shut up.\""]
["02:59,200","03:04,600","\"This game and Advent Children like secured cloud is one of the worst characters ever,\""]
["03:04,600","03:07,960","\"even though he's really likable in the original game.\""]
["03:07,960","03:11,720","\"I wonder why they opted for, I guess, because Advent Children was popular.\""]
["03:11,720","03:13,800","\"They knew you knew you were.\""]
["03:13,800","03:17,000","\"He really likes his angsty shit.\""]
["03:17,000","03:18,200","\"To be fair, so do I.\""]
["03:18,200","03:20,720","\"That's probably what drew me into this as a teenager.\""]
["03:20,720","03:23,320","\"He didn't make Final Fantasy 7, did he?\""]
["03:23,320","03:25,280","\"He just designed the characters, right?\""]
["03:25,280","03:28,080","\"- He, uh, he made cloud in real life.\""]
["03:28,080","03:29,560","\"He impregnated the woman and made the cloud.\""]
["03:29,560","03:30,820","\"- Shut up, shut up!\""]
["03:30,820","03:31,820","\"- It's real trivia!\""]

["03:32,660","03:33,500","\"It's real trivia!\""]
["03:33,500","03:34,660","\"- As far as I know, it's real trivia!\""]
["03:34,660","03:35,500","\"- It's real trivia!\""]
["03:35,500","03:38,200","\"- Some other guy directed the game,\""]
["03:38,200","03:40,360","\"who actually knew what the character he was writing\""]
["03:40,360","03:43,360","\"and to see her new Mioriyeia designed the characters.\""]
["03:43,360","03:44,280","\"- See, now you shut up!\""]
["03:44,280","03:45,280","\"That's all his name!\""]

["03:46,520","03:47,360","\"- Hey!\""]
["03:47,360","03:48,200","\"- Hey!\""]
["03:48,200","03:49,720","\"- I didn't even notice, I was so close.\""]
["03:49,720","03:55,600","\"That's why the director made cloud fun and numero was like no he is angsty I drew him with a cool belt\""]
["03:55,600","04:11,560","\"Sing the Thomas the tank changes go. Oh, I don't fucking I you guys I think got a different\""]

["04:38,740","04:41,700","\"I'm just not gonna go back and do all the powered up ones\""]
["04:41,700","04:44,420","\"Did you ever play enough time for that unfortunately?\""]
["04:44,420","04:47,260","\"Did you ever play the Thomas the Tank Engine fighting game?\""]
["04:47,260","04:49,660","\"Were you ram to trade?\""]

["04:52,820","04:59,260","\"Did you ever play fighting games with your friends and by that I mean throwing Thomas the Tank Engine toys at them and beating them up?\""]
["04:59,260","05:02,140","\"Where were they play worlds where they are not a fighting game?\""]
["05:02,140","05:10,300","\"My mom bought me a Thomas the Tank Engine puzzle and I said I love this thing\""]
["05:10,300","05:12,980","\"- Does anybody alone do this crazy thing?\""]
["05:12,980","05:14,600","\"So that I'm not wasting time here.\""]
["05:14,600","05:17,020","\"Does anybody remember what worlds are in?\""]
["05:17,020","05:18,020","\"- Oh shoot.\""]
["05:18,020","05:18,860","\"- Don't ask me.\""]
["05:18,860","05:21,420","\"- There was one on the pirate ship.\""]
["05:21,420","05:22,780","\"- I already, that was lark scene.\""]

["05:33,700","05:34,540","\"- Oh, you're right there.\""]
["05:34,540","05:37,060","\"- Yes, 'cause it was right next to the, to the same point.\""]
["05:37,060","05:38,180","\"- And I think it's when you didn't do it.\""]
["05:38,180","05:42,020","\"I can do that because we got close the first time and that was before I was even leveled up\""]
["05:42,020","05:49,580","\"Hey guys, yeah, just show you know if if you threw Sora off the top of the tallest tower\""]
["05:49,580","05:51,940","\"He would press circle and regain his balance. Oh\""]
["05:51,940","05:57,260","\"So we can actually jump pretty big triangle Sora has no fall damage\""]
["05:57,260","06:02,620","\"You know his hair would spike into the ground and it would catch you yeah, he would uh it would be like a dart\""]
["06:02,620","06:04,620","\"He would go\""]
["06:04,620","06:06,620","\"Oh, I remember this one I\""]
["06:07,460","06:11,780","\"Hate that guy. I like him in the art, but in game. He does not look so good\""]
["06:11,780","06:16,320","\"And the earth they made him look crazier really yeah, he's got like weird\""]
["06:16,320","06:22,300","\"He's got like weird evil eyes. I think he's a funny guy like dark rings around them\""]
["06:22,300","06:27,060","\"Okay, ding dong. Yes. You're walking down the street. Mm-hmm. You are\""]
["06:27,060","06:34,580","\"Stamping on the sidewalk. Yes killing small insects along the way. Yeah, uh-huh you come across a dirty syringe\""]
["06:34,580","06:44,140","\"Yes full of insects you pick it up you you push on the syringes thing uh-huh to push out what's inside yes what comes out\""]
["06:44,140","06:47,220","\"Suffies imagination\""]
["06:47,220","06:52,380","\"No, it is too horrible to describe it you cannot comprehend what comes out\""]
["06:52,380","06:55,420","\"Okay, would you inject it into you to see what happens?\""]
["06:55,420","07:01,500","\"No, I would not because I can't comprehend what it is and I would not trust that within what if it's so amazing that it makes\""]
["07:01,500","07:06,000","\"Your body filled with you for it just looking at it's in something like a syringe makes me\""]
["07:06,000","07:09,920","\"Expect that there's a 99% chance. It's not scary\""]
["07:09,920","07:15,940","\"If the if a thing that you cannot is like so horribly hideous that you can't comprehend it\""]
["07:15,940","07:22,760","\"No, like causes you to feel ecstasy. That seems very just looking at it. That seems like a bad idea. Yeah, yeah\""]
["07:22,760","07:29,280","\"Okay, well what if what I would do is probably break the syringe open and put it in like a bowl or something\""]
["07:29,280","07:35,840","\"Can you go to get it tested? Yeah, what if you want to go to get it tested and the doctor said no one monkeys\""]
["07:35,840","07:39,020","\"Jumping on the bed you will become addicted to this, but this is the only one of its kind\""]
["07:39,020","07:43,500","\"That would then don't do it. Yeah, don't do it. What it. It makes you really buff\""]
["07:43,500","07:47,600","\"Also good\""]
["07:47,600","07:52,020","\"More which is already the case so it probably kill you because if you're\""]
["07:52,020","07:54,720","\"It you're putting stress on your body\""]
["07:54,720","07:59,040","\"But wouldn't you go cold turkey after that and then you'd be fine, but then you would lose the muscle\""]
["07:59,040","08:00,040","\"It would atrophy.\""]
["08:00,040","08:03,360","\"You know, it takes a long time to lose muscle just so you know.\""]
["08:03,360","08:04,360","\"You think so?\""]
["08:04,360","08:05,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:05,360","08:09,200","\"Whenever people get buff, like really buff, like then they sit on their asses for like\""]
["08:09,200","08:10,200","\"two years.\""]
["08:10,200","08:11,200","\"Isn't it all?\""]
["08:11,200","08:13,840","\"Isn't it all it takes is like to miss a one season of workout for you.\""]
["08:13,840","08:17,520","\"Chris, is this just a request for the audience to create this magical substance for you to\""]
["08:17,520","08:18,520","\"take?\""]
["08:18,520","08:19,520","\"I'll make it.\""]
["08:19,520","08:22,200","\"It'll be my muscle serum.\""]
["08:22,200","08:24,560","\"No Julian, yeah, to fuck up your leg to work out.\""]
["08:24,560","08:26,200","\"I mean to work out this is probably, yeah.\""]
["08:26,200","08:28,640","\"That's probably the best thing to talk to me with.\""]
["08:28,640","08:32,840","\"It makes you really muscly like Tiny the Tiger.\""]
["08:32,840","08:34,040","\"- Wow.\""]
["08:34,040","08:35,520","\"- And it even gives you sneakers.\""]
["08:35,520","08:37,120","\"- But I'm not a cartoon like he is though,\""]
["08:37,120","08:39,280","\"so I'd fall over 'cause my feet would be tiny.\""]
["08:39,280","08:42,120","\"- No, okay, it gives you big muscly feet too.\""]
["08:42,120","08:43,880","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:43,880","08:46,720","\"- I wonder what over muscular feet would look like.\""]
["08:46,720","08:48,280","\"- You could not bother them to look at the--\""]
["08:48,280","08:49,120","\"- You could crush someone between your toes\""]
["08:49,120","08:50,760","\"and they'd have a little veins bulging out of them.\""]
["08:50,760","08:53,560","\"- Okay, Lexious, where is he?\""]
["08:53,560","08:54,560","\"I think that's his name.\""]
["08:54,560","08:55,400","\"- Muscular feet.\""]
["08:55,400","08:58,240","\"- What would you do if you ran really fast\""]
["08:58,240","09:00,440","\"and you look down, you had little six packs on your feet.\""]
["09:00,440","09:01,800","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:01,800","09:02,640","\"- I'm not even googlers.\""]
["09:02,640","09:03,920","\"- Like the bottom side of them?\""]
["09:03,920","09:04,760","\"- No, on top.\""]
["09:04,760","09:05,600","\"- On top?\""]
["09:05,600","09:06,440","\"- On top?\""]
["09:06,440","09:07,280","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:07,280","09:08,640","\"- How about between each of the knuckles\""]
["09:08,640","09:10,200","\"on your hand or little six packs?\""]
["09:10,200","09:12,360","\"- Just little collarbones in each of your toes.\""]
["09:12,360","09:14,160","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:14,160","09:16,380","\"- What if you had a 96 pack?\""]
["09:16,380","09:19,640","\"- That would just look like a bunch of zits, probably.\""]
["09:19,640","09:21,040","\"- Yeah, it probably would.\""]
["09:21,040","09:21,880","\"(laughing)\""]

["09:25,520","09:26,920","\"- You know the girl walks over and pops one.\""]
["09:26,920","09:28,520","\"You go, \"\"AHHHHHHH!\"\"\""]

["17:44,060","17:47,300","\"It's true, they are. Big things come into smaller pieces.\""]
["17:47,300","17:50,900","\"This is sweet, actually. I like this. I like it. I like it a lot. That's cool.\""]
["17:50,900","17:56,320","\"Skyscraper. This is what you did before you had your bianetta.\""]
["17:56,320","17:58,900","\"That's in reference to the Disney cartoon, skyscrapers.\""]
["17:58,900","18:00,620","\"Scrupited scoop.\""]
["18:00,620","18:02,340","\"Remember Sky High?\""]
["18:02,340","18:02,860","\"I do.\""]
["18:02,860","18:04,500","\"Is there going to be a Sky High world?\""]
["18:04,500","18:05,380","\"Is that Disney?\""]
["18:05,380","18:08,260","\"I don't think anybody remembers that film.\""]
["18:08,260","18:10,060","\"I thought that was a very popular film.\""]
["18:10,060","18:10,660","\"Was it?\""]
["18:10,660","18:11,380","\"I thought so.\""]
["18:11,380","18:12,860","\"Everyone I knew talked about it.\""]
["18:12,860","18:13,460","\"Did they really?\""]

["18:16,460","18:18,380","\"Literally every single human being in Ireland knows\""]

["18:20,220","18:22,700","\"Was the entire population of Ireland like in it?\""]
["18:22,700","18:23,700","\"No.\""]
["18:23,700","18:25,740","\"We were just amazed by it like in general\""]
["18:25,740","18:28,020","\"because we don't understand that films are films\""]
["18:28,020","18:28,700","\"and not real.\""]
["18:28,700","18:33,040","\"I played a gigantic monitor in the streets. Everyone looked up at it. They couldn't believe it.\""]
["18:33,040","18:39,340","\"I wonder, like, how many people living in the U.S. you can walk up to with a film and show to them\""]
["18:39,340","18:42,220","\"and they'll think it's real because they've never witnessed a film before?\""]
["18:42,220","18:43,900","\"I have no idea.\""]
["18:43,900","18:46,300","\"People with very closed-off lifestyles.\""]
["18:46,300","18:48,380","\"That would be cool.\""]
["18:48,380","18:49,340","\"That's an environmental thing.\""]
["18:49,340","18:51,420","\"What movie would you show someone like that?\""]
["18:51,420","18:52,700","\"Lord of the Rings.\""]
["18:52,700","18:53,740","\"That would be really cool.\""]
["18:54,620","19:04,240","\"I remember when it came out, I could not stop thinking about how fun it would be to show the Lord of the Rings movies to J.R.R.R.\""]
["19:04,240","19:05,440","\"Tolkien and see what he thought.\""]
["19:05,440","19:07,040","\"Yeah, I love thinking about that stuff.\""]
["19:07,040","19:09,960","\"Even if he had a negative reaction, it would probably be really entertaining.\""]
["19:09,960","19:10,960","\"Did you show Kingdom Hearts?\""]
["19:10,960","19:14,800","\"That would be a YouTube viral video by the Fine Brothers. J.R.R.\""]
["19:14,800","19:16,520","\"Tolkien watches his own movie.\""]
["19:16,520","19:19,600","\"Girl, this makes me mad.\""]
["19:19,600","19:22,760","\"I feel like showing this game to Walt Disney would be even.\""]
["19:22,760","19:23,960","\"That's what I was asking.\""]
["19:23,960","19:27,000","\"What do you think Walt would think of this he'd be so fucking annoyed\""]
["19:27,000","19:33,140","\"You would legit be furious. I think I think so. Yeah, cuz he would say this is against like the message\""]
["19:33,140","19:38,180","\"You'd even want to send I don't know the thing is is it like yes because Mickey has a story\""]
["19:38,180","19:42,560","\"He's fighting in spirit. No, but it's about what happens in the game\""]
["19:42,560","19:47,340","\"Hoping all that I just think he'd be more mad at this stupid story in the stupid\""]
["19:47,340","19:53,620","\"You have to consider he wouldn't know the story they would show him this and he would be like what is he probably could not\""]
["19:53,620","19:56,920","\"comprehend half the stuff on screen why did you give him a weapon he was already\""]
["19:56,920","20:02,760","\"like you know an ignorant country bumpkin you think uh the game plays I know\""]
["20:02,760","20:07,460","\"that he'd be happy the gameplay segments would be what piss him off yeah it would\""]
["20:07,460","20:09,980","\"just be like this is a waste of time where's the story because when you show\""]
["20:09,980","20:12,380","\"somebody something like this that's what you're doing you're presenting them\""]
["20:12,380","20:15,180","\"what it is you're not gonna tell them the storyline you're going to show them\""]
["20:15,180","20:19,580","\"how it plays and like how it works yeah so you'd be seeing this right now I\""]
["20:19,580","20:24,400","\"I guess it would be maybe he'd be amazed that he's like wow I'm controlling a cartoon\""]
["20:24,400","20:28,860","\"I think he would really be into the visual effects and everything. He was very into life\""]
["20:28,860","20:32,000","\"He would be blown away by that making things look pretty and everything\""]
["20:32,000","20:36,540","\"And then he'd see those symbols in the back and goes that's satanic in the dream they go no wall\""]
["20:36,540","20:40,400","\"He didn't see him all that concern about satanic. I'm making a joke\""]
["20:40,400","20:45,900","\"I'm saying the point is this man would not understand what he's seeing here. This would be so alien to him\""]
["20:46,540","20:50,900","\"This would be like the first thing with this kind of influence anyhow that he would see like think about that\""]
["20:50,900","20:53,940","\"Yeah, like if you showed him Dragon Ball Z or something\""]
["20:53,940","20:57,200","\"Oh\""]
["20:57,200","20:59,940","\"Rekoo you need to wake up. This is the final battle\""]
["20:59,940","21:06,360","\"You can't fall asleep now this guy looks cool. He's too tortured and apathetic. He can't care\""]
["21:06,360","21:10,680","\"Oh, I know these amazing things happening in front of his eyes. It's King miss who is he?\""]
["21:10,680","21:15,240","\"Zumness it's supposed to be he's got a new he's got a new\""]
["21:16,220","21:23,500","\"Is this really the last fight? That's it.\""]
["21:23,500","21:27,260","\"Julian, you are fuking with me.\""]
["21:27,260","21:28,220","\"It's over.\""]
["21:28,220","21:28,720","\"No.\""]
["21:28,720","21:30,220","\"He's unchained now.\""]
["21:30,220","21:34,220","\"No, near lying, because even though the first game had like a 60 minute boss fight.\""]
["21:34,220","21:36,220","\"Hi, Mickey.\""]
["21:36,220","21:38,220","\"Oh, were you guys?\""]
