["08:03,700","08:06,600","\"Maybe if you cross him it it changes the context of the game.\""]
["08:06,600","08:07,600","\"Was that like a boss crash Bandicoot?\""]
["08:07,600","08:12,200","\"Yeah, he's from Wrath of Cortex the worst one ever made. Let's be robot crunch. Hell yeah.\""]

["08:31,780","08:38,100","\"cool any of these models look, just remember they're hollow on the inside and have no guts.\""]
["08:38,100","08:43,060","\"It is kind of fucked up how they don't put guts in video game characters. Imagine if\""]
["08:43,060","08:46,740","\"you were told you had guts, but then you looked inside and you had no guts. How would that\""]
["08:46,740","08:52,140","\"make you fail? I don't know. That would be it. That would put you into a legitimate existential\""]
["08:52,140","08:56,700","\"crisis yeah I'd be like where's my guts everybody else has guts where my guts\""]
["08:56,700","09:02,100","\"yeah it's like what if what if you got really really drunk one night and then\""]
["09:02,100","09:06,300","\"you woke up kind of in a days and then you didn't really think anything about\""]
["09:06,300","09:10,500","\"it but then like a month later you got a knock on your door and it was just you\""]
["09:10,500","09:14,980","\"and you're like yeah I'm the real chris O'Neill you need to like get out now\""]
["09:14,980","09:20,100","\"and and you're like what are you talking about and he's like check your guts\""]
["09:20,100","09:24,400","\"Yeah, you got no guts. So would you let the guy have your house? Oh\""]
["09:24,400","09:27,140","\"Hell no, what the fuck?\""]
["09:27,140","09:29,060","\"Even if you had no guts\""]
["09:29,060","09:31,220","\"Yeah, even if he's like listen man\""]
["09:31,220","09:37,180","\"I can empirically prove with my tomar engineer brain that yours is a complete copy of it\""]
["09:37,180","09:42,940","\"So does that mean that he his life is more valid than mine once I discover that he was there first?\""]
["09:42,940","09:48,860","\"Well, I mean keep in mind in this scenario assuming you have guts right now. You're you\""]
["09:49,780","09:56,220","\"Sure, right? The you that's on this couch right now. That's the you that shows up in the door\""]

["10:02,740","10:03,740","\"debate yourself\""]
["10:03,740","10:08,500","\"I have to be ready to just murder the copy of me because if I were the copy of me\""]
["10:08,500","10:10,500","\"I'd try to kill the original to survive\""]
["10:10,500","10:12,780","\"look\""]
["10:12,780","10:17,060","\"There we go, even if you had no guts you wouldn't just be like oh shucks. What was me?\""]
["10:17,060","10:21,340","\"I guess I'll be a butler or whatever. I mean, maybe maybe murder's a little strong\""]
["10:21,340","10:29,260","\"It's like is he just gonna throw me out? I don't know what would I do I would I should know what I would do to clone me\""]
["10:29,260","10:35,220","\"Would you fuck it? I definitely wouldn't let it keep my house. Are we still talking about the clone with no guts?\""]
["10:35,220","10:40,780","\"Yeah, what's inside of it just all be inside of it if you wanted to be fill it up with fucking\""]
["10:41,500","10:45,300","\"Okay, let's say you have you can like take double shifts at your job now\""]
["10:45,300","10:49,980","\"So you have two jobs double the income double the you and you're you're your best pal\""]
["10:49,980","10:52,620","\"But what if someone smashes it and like boiling milk comes out?\""]
["10:52,620","10:56,680","\"Yeah, well that then then it's all over then the rides then the ride stopped\""]
["10:56,680","11:03,140","\"But you scald your employees and get fired if only for the fact that I could get away with working\""]
["11:03,140","11:05,580","\"every other day\""]
["11:05,660","11:09,500","\"Because it's like you could work two separate jobs and make a whole bunch of money\""]
["11:09,500","11:14,980","\"Or you could just work half as much and make the same amount of money. I'd start a band with myself\""]
["11:14,980","11:21,700","\"That's a cool one for the musically talented. All right. Here's here's a conundrum\""]
["11:21,700","11:26,260","\"You have a perfect copy of you you guys are living together. You guys are roommates\""]
["11:26,260","11:29,660","\"Would you be comfortable jerking off in the same room? No\""]
["11:29,660","11:35,040","\"No, if there was probably are you comfortable jerking off in the same room with a mirror Chris\""]
["11:35,040","11:40,280","\"Yeah, but that's not a different person. I always want privacy jerking off even like hats there\""]
["11:40,280","11:46,880","\"I feel weird like I wouldn't mind the other me seeing me naked or whatever, but yeah, I'd probably still jerk off on my own\""]
["11:46,880","11:53,760","\"Well, you do if just by by the regular nature of you guys hanging out and doing different things\""]
["11:53,760","11:59,040","\"Oh, come on the other you just kind of have like a slightly different diet, you know different exercise or whatever\""]
["11:59,040","12:03,240","\"And the other you was just getting like I don't know slightly more in shape\""]
["12:03,360","12:08,140","\"You noticed like one day walking around naked like other used penis was looking a little bit bigger like\""]
["12:08,140","12:13,460","\"Would I get jealous of other man like you're not even a real me this is bullshit\""]
["12:13,460","12:19,260","\"Sorry this this levels a little intense\""]
["12:19,260","12:25,040","\"It's like a cortex castle is that what this is called yeah cortex\""]
["12:25,040","12:31,020","\"Castle that was literally a guess but I guess it wasn't it wasn't a very hard one to make maybe it was like\""]
["12:31,360","12:37,980","\"Consciously stuck in your mind from seeing it maybe it's also a castle and the character prominently featured his cortex\""]
["12:37,980","12:41,100","\"That's a really good point. It's got a great alliteration to it. Yeah\""]
["12:41,100","12:49,500","\"I thought I could do it with the boost that really pees me off good thing. You still had a massive leave\""]
["12:49,500","12:51,540","\"Yeah, that's true\""]
["12:51,540","12:53,640","\"If I get a little boost the boost\""]
["12:53,640","12:59,560","\"This guy's named crunch. Yeah, isn't that cool is he like crashed from the future like what's this whole deal?\""]
["12:59,560","13:05,400","\"No, so when crash one two and three and crash team racing were finally done naughty dog sold the\""]
["13:05,400","13:10,080","\"Franchise to someone and they created this fucking stupid ass character\""]
["13:10,080","13:14,320","\"I don't know if he crashed from the future\""]
["13:14,320","13:19,600","\"No, he's just some he's just cortex like I made a better bandicoot. It's just stupid\""]
["13:19,600","13:24,960","\"And he just hangs out with it. No. Yeah at the end of the game. He's like wow. Thank you for fighting me\""]
["13:24,960","13:28,560","\"And you're like, okay, that doesn't make any sense, but okay, but uh\""]
["13:29,080","13:35,600","\"No travelers tails the guy who made it is like really cool, but I gotta say as a kid I fucking hated nearly every game\""]
["13:35,600","13:42,760","\"They put out oh you you saw that weird creature with the with the like bandana nap sack\""]
["13:42,760","13:49,760","\"I'm in for a fucking time when you know something as shit as a kid that's when it's really shit\""]

["13:59,320","14:03,400","\"But like the thing is that the guy who makes those games\""]
["14:03,400","14:09,920","\"He knows how to like do amazing stuff with code so that the games have like cool like a few likes\""]
["14:09,920","14:16,560","\"Like ahead of time of other games, but like none of them aged very well. Were you were you talking about him last time?\""]
["14:16,560","14:21,000","\"I don't know maybe I was probably saying check out his channel because his YouTube channel is really cool\""]

["15:01,560","15:05,480","\"Yeah, we should we should patent that immediately. Oh\""]
["15:05,480","15:12,100","\"Oh, you an egg was laid upon you this day. I really thought I avoided it\""]
["15:12,100","15:17,200","\"Well, we might get something cool now. What the fuck? I don't know what made me go that high\""]

["16:01,800","16:05,880","\"Don't even need to accelerate. They just start off at top speed when they like stop bouncing around\""]
["16:05,880","16:13,800","\"Is this somebody's level right now? This is engines. Okay, so I guess my theory is not correct that like whoever's level\""]
["16:13,800","16:19,520","\"It is just starts winning because engine isn't even I don't even think he's in this race doesn't look like he's racing\""]
["16:19,520","16:27,880","\"Recording session and judging by what I've read on the internet this version of crash team racing is much harder than the original\""]
["16:27,880","16:31,680","\"Oh, yeah, yeah, everyone's complaining about how unfair it is\""]
["16:31,680","16:35,040","\"I always wonder about that like is it harder or as a kid\""]
["16:35,040","16:40,880","\"Did you just have an unlimited amount of patience for shit like this because you you were just happy to be there?\""]
["16:40,880","16:44,480","\"There has been moments where I've gone back and played nostalgia games like Tasmania\""]
["16:44,480","16:47,200","\"And I was just astounded that I got as far as I did as a kid\""]
["16:47,200","16:51,320","\"Oh, I know what you mean. It's like wow. I really was a fucking asshole back then\""]
["16:51,320","16:56,600","\"Yeah, I feel like I was so much better at games as a as a wheat child when I would like\""]
["16:56,600","17:05,080","\"Play the shit out of anything that I got even if it was not very good. Yeah, I mean that's definitely part of being a kid is like\""]
["17:05,080","17:10,320","\"You get what you get you're you're very limited if any income\""]
["17:10,320","17:15,260","\"And so when you get a game you're gonna make the most of it fucking hate crunch dude\""]
["17:15,260","17:20,860","\"You're not gonna complain that it's bad. You're gonna convince yourself that you just need to get better at it\""]
["17:20,860","17:26,900","\"Yeah, yeah, I lost that one by a long a long shot. Holy shit. Look you beat me by like a full ten seconds\""]
["17:26,900","17:28,900","\"Yeah, but you were still second. Yeah\""]
["17:28,900","17:34,740","\"So tiny was just completely unchallenged there. I'm gonna change from crunch. I don't feel like he's very good\""]
["17:34,740","17:38,300","\"All right, I think he's kind of stinky and crunch\""]
["17:38,300","17:41,100","\"I love Crash by Nicole. He is cool.\""]
["17:41,100","17:44,100","\"If you hate the character so much, why were you playing as him?\""]
["17:44,100","17:46,500","\"I wanted to try be someone I've never been before.\""]
["17:46,500","17:48,300","\"Okay. You know?\""]
["17:48,300","17:50,300","\"We spit, we played as trash.\""]
["17:50,300","17:53,300","\"Ah, Crash, most of the last time, right?\""]
["17:53,300","17:56,300","\"Let's, let's change to someone cool.\""]
["17:56,300","17:57,300","\"Be the goblin.\""]

["18:02,300","18:05,300","\"You might, you might want to choose him just to take him off the board, you know?\""]
["18:05,300","18:10,120","\"You know, I'm in crunch of the exact same stats look I'm gonna be fucking stinky oxide\""]
["18:10,120","18:14,020","\"Yeah, that's really cool\""]
["18:14,020","18:18,500","\"I like the idea that like if you play through the whole game is him and you get to like the final level\""]
["18:18,500","18:23,140","\"Or you have to race him and save the earth or whatever you just show up in your ham and you're like\""]
["18:23,140","18:27,100","\"Yeah, I don't understand what's gonna happen. It's really weird\""]
["18:27,100","18:32,860","\"I think we should make a point to find out what'll happen\""]
["18:33,380","18:37,320","\"Okay, let's do it you show up and you point out to him that he has no guts\""]
["18:37,320","18:40,860","\"I am for you with no guts\""]
["18:40,860","18:43,380","\"That's kind of a fucked up thing to say\""]
["18:43,380","18:46,660","\"Kind of is yeah, I am the you with no guts\""]
["18:46,660","18:49,300","\"step back\""]
