["00:55,900","01:00,540","\"- The same TV as this when I played Rayman Origins.\""]
["01:00,540","01:02,860","\"And all the text was so tiny because I expect you\""]
["01:02,860","01:04,860","\"to have a big TV now.\""]
["01:04,860","01:06,660","\"- For the first two years or three years,\""]
["01:06,660","01:08,860","\"I hated HDTV.\""]
["01:08,860","01:11,500","\"I thought the older TVs made everything look better.\""]
["01:11,500","01:14,100","\"- How do you feel now?\""]
["01:14,100","01:15,940","\"- I like it now.\""]

["01:21,860","01:23,540","\"- No.\""]
["01:23,540","01:24,380","\"I don't like that.\""]
["01:24,380","01:25,860","\"I don't like movies over 30 seconds.\""]
["01:25,860","01:28,260","\"I don't think it ended up working.\""]
["01:28,260","01:31,380","\"Like it ended up, from what I understand,\""]
["01:31,380","01:34,500","\"just being too expensive to be worth it, right?\""]
["01:34,500","01:37,340","\"- I mean, as far as I know, it makes 3D better,\""]
["01:37,340","01:39,420","\"but I don't care about 3D.\""]
["01:39,420","01:41,620","\"- Have you seen anything that you thought\""]
["01:41,620","01:43,900","\"made particularly good use of 3D?\""]
["01:43,900","01:46,020","\"- I mean, because personally, I don't know\""]
["01:46,020","01:49,620","\"if I've seen anything that was as good for it as Coraline,\""]
["01:49,620","01:52,500","\"and that was like way at the beginning of the 3D stuff.\""]
["01:52,500","01:55,880","\"I mean, Avatar was pretty much made for 3D.\""]
["01:55,880","01:57,340","\"That's true, I've never seen Avatar.\""]
["01:57,340","01:58,700","\"I don't know if that would look better.\""]
["01:58,700","02:01,120","\"You just forget about it after like five minutes.\""]
["02:01,120","02:02,720","\"You honestly don't even notice it.\""]
["02:02,720","02:06,520","\"It doesn't pop out at you.\""]
["02:06,520","02:07,800","\"What is it do, Van?\""]
["02:07,800","02:10,760","\"It just looks like it's like in the distance.\""]
["02:10,760","02:12,640","\"Like it looks 3D, but far away from you.\""]
["02:12,640","02:14,360","\"So like, I don't see the point of it.\""]
["02:14,360","02:18,360","\"Were you not immersed in the magical world of Avatar?\""]
["02:18,360","02:20,480","\"Did you not feel like one of the Navi?\""]
["02:20,480","02:21,320","\"No.\""]
["02:21,320","02:26,200","\"as naive as the Navi. You want to know something funny? The last time I remember\""]
["02:26,200","02:30,020","\"something popping out and feeling like it was right in front of my face was Spy\""]
["02:30,020","02:37,120","\"Kids 3D. I don't think I've ever had that same like... Robert Rodriguez came into\""]
["02:37,120","02:42,320","\"the theater and grabbed your face as sort of shaking your face. I think it's\""]
["02:42,320","02:46,880","\"cuz back then the... it was the red and blue 3D effect and I think that... Oh yeah!\""]
["02:46,880","02:49,600","\"It pops out better, but you lose all the color with it\""]
["02:49,600","02:55,560","\"First you want to watch spike in 3d no more was the last time you've seen yeah\""]
["02:55,560","02:58,360","\"I don't really want to see that again. I saw it a year ago\""]
["02:58,360","03:02,240","\"It's one of those movies where it's so bad that it makes you like not\""]
["03:02,240","03:04,960","\"retroactively not like the before one\""]
["03:04,960","03:12,920","\"It's funny though. I think they're all funny. He's the guy you're the guy and Elijah. What is in it?\""]
["03:13,600","03:16,500","\"It's true he comes in for a little cameo and then he dies right away\""]
["03:16,500","03:21,760","\"Yeah, what is a movie that you feel like you could never ever ever watch it again period?\""]
["03:21,760","03:23,760","\"What's your number?\""]
["03:23,760","03:28,980","\"What is that? It's that thing I told you about yeah, I remember that horrible horrible chick flick. I\""]
["03:28,980","03:32,640","\"Wonder I think spike it 3d is getting close to that\""]
["03:32,640","03:36,800","\"I don't know why I could probably sit through what's your number again over?\""]
["03:36,800","03:42,000","\"Have you seen that movie with Johnny Depp and it's John Delder?\""]
["03:42,680","03:44,680","\"No public\""]
["03:44,680","03:49,680","\"Public what was that called anyway that movie was fucking so boring me and my dad walked out of it\""]
["03:49,680","03:53,760","\"Oh, I don't think I ever walked out of like a theater for anything\""]
["03:53,760","03:58,080","\"I think that's one of the only times I ever did that I've probably done that twice in my life\""]
["03:58,080","04:03,080","\"And that was one of them I've fallen asleep plenty in theaters, but I've never actually walked out\""]
["04:03,080","04:07,800","\"We might that was sitting there bored out of our fucking minds I\""]
["04:07,800","04:11,120","\"Remember being in the theater for\""]
["04:11,120","04:16,120","\"for cabin in the woods and I was close to passing out\""]
["04:16,120","04:20,000","\"because I got sick that day, like unexpectedly.\""]
["04:20,000","04:20,840","\"- Aww.\""]
["04:20,840","04:22,560","\"- And so I was sitting there in the chair\""]
["04:22,560","04:24,320","\"feeling really fucking miserable.\""]
["04:24,320","04:26,120","\"- It's a pretty entertaining first watch.\""]
["04:26,120","04:29,600","\"- But I would say yes, first watch.\""]
["04:29,600","04:31,700","\"And then after that, it's like, okay,\""]
["04:31,700","04:33,440","\"we've seen the twists and the surprises.\""]
["04:33,440","04:34,800","\"You can't really enjoy it.\""]
["04:34,800","04:38,160","\"- Yeah, like that, yeah, that's a one time movie.\""]
["04:38,160","04:40,320","\"- After you've seen that movie once,\""]
["04:40,320","04:44,320","\"The only good part about it that you can go back and re-watch is the whole monster sequence.\""]
["04:44,320","04:45,320","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:45,320","04:49,920","\"That's like one of the shitty things about Twist movies.\""]
["04:49,920","04:53,720","\"I still contend that there's...\""]
["04:53,720","04:58,200","\"You can enjoy a movie of Ginnafino with the Twisters if it's really written well.\""]
["04:58,200","05:04,320","\"I put that to the test when I saw Psycho for the first time a couple of years ago.\""]
["05:04,320","05:07,480","\"Everybody knows what happens in Psycho, but it was like...\""]
["05:07,480","05:11,940","\"I still was compelled and, you know,\""]
["05:11,940","05:13,540","\"that I was invested in the story,\""]
["05:13,540","05:14,380","\"even though I knew I knew I was gonna happen.\""]
["05:14,380","05:15,220","\"- I think it's 'cause it was actually\""]
["05:15,220","05:17,100","\"full of like interesting moments\""]
["05:17,100","05:19,180","\"rather than just twist shit over and over.\""]
["05:19,180","05:20,180","\"- Right.\""]
["05:20,180","05:22,020","\"- Well, can we all agree,\""]
["05:22,020","05:26,060","\"if you had a 1,000 Heartless battle in any of those movies,\""]
["05:26,060","05:28,060","\"they would suddenly become the best movies of all time.\""]
["05:28,060","05:30,860","\"- They would suddenly be very cool if there was a thousand\""]
["05:30,860","05:32,660","\"of the same Heartless.\""]
["05:32,660","05:34,980","\"- But you have to dispatch with the same--\""]
["05:34,980","05:37,420","\"- The kind that doesn't threaten you in any way.\""]
["05:37,420","05:41,120","\"Did they actually code it so that when you kill Aratlas, one of the sprites disappears?\""]
["05:41,120","05:45,920","\"What happens if some of the sprites disappear and then it spawns new ones in their place?\""]
["05:45,920","05:46,420","\"Oh.\""]
["05:46,420","05:51,420","\"But now, like, the whole screen is empty, so they must have been removing them.\""]
["05:51,420","05:52,820","\"Yeah, that's what I'm saying.\""]
["05:52,820","05:53,320","\"It's cool.\""]
["05:53,320","05:54,120","\"It trades them out.\""]
["05:54,120","05:57,520","\"I like that a lot!\""]
["05:57,520","06:02,420","\"Chris, what's your favorite pre-rendered video game?\""]
["06:02,420","06:03,420","\"Pre-rendered?\""]
["06:03,420","06:04,920","\"Uh, Donkey Kong Country.\""]
["06:04,920","06:05,920","\"Yeah, something like that.\""]
["06:05,920","06:06,920","\"Oh, like Art Style.\""]
["06:06,920","06:07,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:07,480","06:08,640","\"Muh, mine.\""]
["06:08,640","06:15,280","\"OK, I like the art style of Donkey Kong Country more than Yoshi's story.\""]
["06:15,280","06:17,840","\"I would probably say.\""]
["06:17,840","06:20,200","\"Donkey Kong Country to.\""]
["06:20,200","06:22,920","\"As in the second gate.\""]
["06:22,920","06:25,440","\"Hang on, so I got tired.\""]
["06:25,440","06:26,360","\"Wait, wait, wait.\""]
["06:26,360","06:29,760","\"Name some more pre-render games like Heart of Darkness with that count.\""]

["06:55,960","06:57,840","\"Don't say that again.\""]
["06:57,840","07:00,080","\"I hate it so much.\""]
["07:00,080","07:02,080","\"Oh\""]

["02:41:49,600","02:41:54,720","\"That game was fun to mess with to the mods and that were actually pretty fun. They tired out this poor 2d plane\""]

["02:42:36,320","02:42:40,640","\"Remember I think it was the week we started they came in and shut it down for a bit\""]
["02:42:40,640","02:42:46,720","\"Yeah, and then and then people were livid about it, so they undid it, but it's like hey you guys still did it\""]
["02:42:46,720","02:42:52,880","\"Yeah, that's pretty lame to do yeah, I think it's because they were nervous about their multiplayer service\""]
