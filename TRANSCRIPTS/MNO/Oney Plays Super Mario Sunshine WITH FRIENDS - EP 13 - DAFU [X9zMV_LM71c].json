["02:28,920","02:32,640","\"I did without his permission and I felt so bad I never stole a game in my life.\""]
["02:32,640","02:34,880","\"So they both literally don't have a conscience.\""]
["02:34,880","02:39,400","\"You know how schools do those things where like, oh we don't want to, we have to raise\""]
["02:39,400","02:44,960","\"money by having kids sell candy bars and I just fucking, I brought back one of the boxes\""]

["03:12,680","03:17,920","\"Of course I have so much nightmares it fucks you up. It's not good. Do you have dreams at your back at school?\""]

["03:24,580","03:27,820","\"Dream I've had dreams and I know that it's such a cliche, but I've had the dream\""]
["03:27,820","03:31,340","\"Where it's like oh you thought you were done with school\""]
["03:31,340","03:36,920","\"But turns out you didn't actually graduate and now you got to go back and you forgot everything\""]
["03:36,920","03:39,240","\"So you're gonna do really poorly. I mean that's the sort of dream\""]
["03:40,080","03:43,780","\"The thing is I don't have it like oh actually now you need to go back\""]
["03:43,780","03:49,680","\"Usually what I have is like oh yeah, you never you never finish and you're still waiting on this one thing\""]
["03:49,680","03:57,380","\"So you're like 20 26 and you're going back in like oh ha ha ha you still have one test you need to do\""]
["03:57,380","04:01,840","\"Yeah, I know I had those ones where you like I go\""]
["04:01,840","04:03,360","\"I've been going to school this whole time\""]
["04:03,360","04:07,920","\"But I forgot everything and I can't find my classes and I have these all these tests lined up\""]
["04:07,920","04:15,080","\"And I'm just like I feel like I think the worst one I had as a dream was that I was back in school again\""]
["04:15,080","04:22,640","\"And they they I had already repeated like three years already and I was like 29 in the dream\""]
["04:22,640","04:24,640","\"I was older for some reason and\""]
["04:24,640","04:30,440","\"The idea was like oh, yeah, you're going to have to keep repeating for like six more years\""]

["04:31,320","04:36,040","\"That you hadn't taken before did I ever tell you about the nightmare moment I had in real life\""]
["04:36,560","04:41,240","\"Where it was so outlandish and crazy it could have just been a nightmare that I would wake up from but it was real\""]
["04:41,240","04:43,560","\"Tell us where I was walking downtown\""]
["04:43,560","04:49,120","\"And I came across this guy that I barely knew in school and I used to just stop and say hello to everybody\""]
