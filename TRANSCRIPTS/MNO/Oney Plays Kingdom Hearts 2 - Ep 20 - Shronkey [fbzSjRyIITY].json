["00:10,960","00:12,640","\"Maybe they'll listen to the fans.\""]
["00:12,640","00:13,200","\"*Laugh*\""]
["00:13,200","00:16,640","\"Is- is it gonna be okay?\""]
["00:16,640","00:18,160","\"He made a Homer sound. He did.\""]
["00:18,160","00:22,480","\"That really put me off at the beginning of Final Fantasy XV when it said\""]
["00:22,480","00:24,560","\"\"\"This is for you, the fans!\"\"\""]
["00:24,560","00:28,160","\"\"\"This is a fan game for Final Fantasy.\"\"\""]
["00:28,160","00:30,640","\"Wasn't it a different game originally? Like a different title?\""]
["00:30,640","00:31,140","\"I don't know.\""]
["00:31,140","00:32,640","\"And then they turned it into 15.\""]
["00:32,640","00:34,480","\"The only thing I got from that was like,\""]
["00:34,480","00:37,600","\"\"\"Oh, we pandered to you hardcore fans who wanted more of the same.\"\"\""]
["00:37,600","00:40,800","\"I wanted to see more of that game because I don't really know enough about it.\""]
["00:40,800","00:43,520","\"And people kind of stopped discussing it very quickly.\""]
["00:43,520","00:44,880","\"Because it's not that good.\""]
["00:44,880","00:46,480","\"I don't know. I need to see more.\""]
["00:46,480","00:49,600","\"It has good things in it, but overall it's kind of boring.\""]
["00:49,600","00:52,240","\"It seems like it could be kind of like a laid-back kind of game,\""]
["00:52,240","00:54,160","\"like doing the road trips and everything maybe.\""]
["00:54,160","00:55,120","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:55,120","00:56,960","\"You probably have to be in the right mindset for it.\""]
["00:57,520","01:02,800","\"I forgot they did say that didn't they they it opened up by saying every time you turn on I think\""]
["01:02,800","01:08,320","\"fans are something like that is it every time I think I'm probably wrong there I thought so we\""]
["01:08,320","01:13,680","\"only played it once I've waited a few times I forgot they said but oh yeah\""]
["01:13,680","01:19,520","\"I'm now fantastic hey yeah we do yeah\""]
["01:19,520","01:23,760","\"what was Bobby's Bobby's world again I forgot what he was singing or something like that\""]
["01:24,320","01:28,920","\"Forget it's you know, it's better to forget Bobby's word. Why?\""]
["01:28,920","01:37,000","\"It was boring. It's a show, but it's funny looking you were just saying you didn't like how he looked but now I do kind of\""]
["01:37,000","01:42,520","\"No, I can't get his imperfections. I like his stupid smushin face\""]
["01:42,520","01:49,120","\"What if you found out that how we mandel did that to him deliberately that would laugh?\""]
["01:50,240","01:53,480","\"Like a little Ted no, I don't get the joke\""]
["01:53,480","01:58,000","\"So the joke is that that's a little boy voice he did and it got so popular they made a show out of it\""]
["01:58,000","02:00,300","\"Yes, that is seriously the origin of that country\""]
["02:00,300","02:02,700","\"But why is the why do people like that voice so much?\""]
["02:02,700","02:07,320","\"Because it was the because they weren't laughing with him. They were laughing at him\""]
["02:07,320","02:11,380","\"They couldn't believe this guy was actually touring around with that really no\""]
["02:11,380","02:14,520","\"Oh\""]

["03:08,960","03:13,960","\"Why did they make random ice shards appear in the air and drop onto the ground?\""]
["03:13,960","03:14,960","\"That's kind of cool.\""]
["03:14,960","03:16,960","\"It's a very weird trap to set up.\""]
