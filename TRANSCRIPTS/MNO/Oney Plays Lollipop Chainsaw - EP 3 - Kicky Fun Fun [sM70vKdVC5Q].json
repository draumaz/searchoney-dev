["01:42,520","01:48,120","\"No, he's got a really fucking stupid head. So the point is part of the movie is when a stupid head you say\""]

["05:47,960","05:50,960","\"It was trying to do something a little bit different, which is nice.\""]

["05:53,960","05:57,960","\"That was a really, really weird period of time for games when everything was brown.\""]
["05:57,960","05:58,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:58,960","06:00,960","\"It was just because it's so better for some reason.\""]
["06:00,960","06:04,720","\"I mean, there's always just phases like that. We're kind of going with that with Unreal 4 right now\""]
["06:04,720","06:07,880","\"Yeah, there's just full graphical phases and games\""]
["06:07,880","06:12,000","\"I mean what a lot of people doing on real force grade like fucking arksis what they're doing with it\""]

["06:20,420","06:25,700","\"Yeah, GDC. There's a really good panel on it that discusses the whole process. It's more intensive than just drawing it\""]
["06:25,700","06:28,680","\"But it pays off it looks amazing\""]
["06:30,320","06:34,360","\"Fighters I've been playing fighters every day since it came out\""]
