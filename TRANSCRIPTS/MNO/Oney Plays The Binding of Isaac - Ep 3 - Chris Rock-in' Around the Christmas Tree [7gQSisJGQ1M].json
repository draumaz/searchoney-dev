["03:00,180","03:03,100","\"So I was like I'll just walk home, but I made such a mistake\""]
["03:03,100","03:06,860","\"I really, I gave myself too much credit\""]
["03:06,860","03:09,820","\"about one block down from their house.\""]
["03:09,820","03:11,940","\"I was like, oh no, this isn't gonna work.\""]

["03:14,540","03:15,380","\"There's no way.\""]
["03:15,380","03:17,140","\"So then it got to the point where, you know,\""]
["03:17,140","03:18,300","\"when you need to poo so bad,\""]
["03:18,300","03:20,820","\"you start actually just clenching your butt cheeks together\""]
["03:20,820","03:22,500","\"to hold it in?\""]
["03:22,500","03:24,500","\"Like it's coming out, but you're literally\""]
["03:24,500","03:26,580","\"physically plugging it in.\""]
["03:26,580","03:29,420","\"And like every four steps, it would be like that,\""]
["03:29,420","03:32,740","\"you knees go weak and you start to kind of go dizzy\""]
["03:32,740","03:36,380","\"little bit you're sweating you're sweating so anyways I was like this is\""]
["03:36,380","03:39,940","\"not gonna work there's no way I start looking around for bushes I start but\""]
["03:39,940","03:42,900","\"this is the middle of the day that's the problem if it was at night I would have\""]
["03:42,900","03:47,020","\"had any problem at all but I start looking around there's no good bushes\""]
["03:47,020","03:51,500","\"there's no I saw a car park where they left their gate open and I was debating\""]
["03:51,500","03:55,500","\"if I just like go to the back of their fucking parking lot like in the corner\""]
["03:55,500","04:01,100","\"behind a car just as quickly as I could no go so finally I saw a dumpster by a\""]
["04:01,100","04:03,660","\"a school, luckily school was out of session,\""]
["04:03,660","04:05,740","\"or it was in session and they weren't outside.\""]
["04:05,740","04:09,580","\"And I had been behind a dumpster.\""]
["04:09,580","04:12,660","\"And I had to like push the dumpster like a foot\""]
["04:12,660","04:14,780","\"so I could actually get behind it.\""]
["04:14,780","04:16,780","\"But as that was happening, I don't know\""]
["04:16,780","04:18,540","\"if I'm going to too much detail,\""]
["04:18,540","04:20,740","\"but as that was happening, it was just coming out\""]
["04:20,740","04:23,140","\"like the whole time, it was terrible.\""]
["04:23,140","04:26,180","\"And I didn't, because my pants weren't all the way off,\""]
["04:26,180","04:28,300","\"like I didn't wanna poo on my pants.\""]
["04:28,300","04:30,980","\"So I ended up putting my arm against the wall\""]
["04:30,980","04:33,420","\"and one on the dumpster and my legs like up\""]
["04:33,420","04:36,380","\"and I put my foot up against like one of the things\""]
["04:36,380","04:37,860","\"like the little wall area.\""]
["04:37,860","04:40,180","\"And I was like holding myself up like Spider-Man\""]
["04:40,180","04:44,020","\"just like fucking diarrhea pouring out of my ass.\""]
["04:44,020","04:46,860","\"It was really bad.\""]
["04:46,860","04:50,420","\"I felt really bad and all I had, I had a plastic bag\""]
["04:50,420","04:52,940","\"and I had some receipts in there.\""]
["04:52,940","04:54,100","\"And that's all I had.\""]
["04:54,100","04:56,580","\"And these receipts, I never thought about it\""]
["04:56,580","04:57,900","\"but they just slip right off.\""]
["04:57,900","04:59,100","\"They're so slippery.\""]
["04:59,100","05:01,100","\"Like it wasn't doing any wiping at all.\""]
["05:01,100","05:04,900","\"Ah, anyways, the walk home was uncomfortable.\""]
["05:04,900","05:05,900","\"I'm sorry, Mick.\""]
["05:05,900","05:06,600","\"It's all right.\""]
["05:06,600","05:07,600","\"I'm a grown man.\""]
["05:07,600","05:09,700","\"What are the worst things?\""]
["05:09,700","05:11,600","\"Yeah, with me, it's like my body.\""]
["05:11,600","05:12,100","\"That story.\""]
["05:12,100","05:14,400","\"I thought it was really embarrassing.\""]
["05:14,400","05:16,300","\"You don't want that in the in the street.\""]
["05:16,300","05:20,700","\"Mick, I like your BC story.\""]
["05:20,700","05:21,200","\"No.\""]
["05:21,200","05:25,700","\"When I was younger, my dad thought it would be real funny to prank me.\""]
["05:25,700","05:28,200","\"He put cling film on the toilet, right?\""]
["05:28,200","05:28,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:28,700","05:32,340","\"So he thought that when I'd piss onto it all the people bounce back up on me\""]
["05:32,340","05:36,980","\"But instead I diarrhea onto it and it flowed down into my pants\""]
["05:36,980","05:43,140","\"And then I got an infection\""]
["05:43,140","05:53,820","\"Yeah, he was like I'm so sorry the only way to regain your trust now is for me to do the exact same and then he did it too\""]
["05:53,820","05:58,420","\"Right in front of him and then we were both in the hospital beds holding hands\""]
["05:58,420","06:01,420","\"That sounds made of his shit.\""]
["06:01,420","06:02,420","\"No.\""]
["06:02,420","06:04,420","\"That really happened.\""]
["06:04,420","06:06,420","\"I think...\""]
["06:06,420","06:08,420","\"Tomorrow you look really disappointed.\""]
["06:08,420","06:12,420","\"You really wanted that to be true.\""]
["06:12,420","06:14,420","\"No, what? No!\""]
["06:14,420","06:16,420","\"You didn't even look at me.\""]
["06:16,420","06:19,420","\"I could hear it in your voice, okay?\""]
["06:19,420","06:22,420","\"You sounded like a child being told Santa Claus isn't real.\""]
["06:22,420","06:24,420","\"Spoiler, Santa Claus isn't real.\""]
["06:24,420","06:29,700","\"No, because I always want to trust people, but Chris has taught me not to trust people.\""]
["06:29,700","06:35,220","\"That's a great... What a compliment.\""]
["06:35,220","06:37,060","\"Yeah. I thought we were friends.\""]
["06:37,060","06:42,500","\"I just want to say, Chris, you're one of my good friends. You taught me not to trust people.\""]
["06:42,500","06:43,460","\"Stop me not to trust people.\""]
["06:43,460","06:44,100","\"Never to trust.\""]
["06:44,100","06:44,420","\"Get that.\""]
["06:44,420","06:47,220","\"The body, I feel all.\""]
["06:47,220","06:48,740","\"I just got a lot of hearts.\""]
["06:48,740","06:52,100","\"The binding of Isaac is the first game Edward McMillan.\""]
["06:52,100","06:54,820","\"Ever made Edmond Edward Edward\""]
["06:54,820","07:00,280","\"Top ten times Edward McMillan was caught changing his name illegally\""]
["07:00,280","07:06,100","\"He's all he does Chris you like your name Chris so Christopher O'Neill\""]
["07:06,100","07:09,020","\"Yeah, do you like that name when I was younger? I did not like Christopher\""]
["07:09,020","07:15,360","\"So what did you want to change your name to nothing? I just didn't like Christopher, but then I grew up and I actually do kind of like it now\""]
["07:15,360","07:17,060","\"I\""]
["07:17,060","07:20,540","\"Still don't I like it cuz you can say you don't like the name Chris\""]
["07:20,820","07:24,320","\"You can walk up the girls and bikinis and say yo dude. I'm tofer\""]
["07:24,320","07:29,100","\"You know that is tofer grace is actual name Christopher. It's tofer yeah\""]
["07:29,100","07:32,900","\"Yeah, or Christopher. Sorry and you can also walk up and say hey\""]
["07:32,900","07:35,180","\"My name is pissed if you want me to piss near you\""]
["07:35,180","07:41,260","\"And all the girls always respond clap they just respond buddy clap\""]
["07:41,260","07:44,820","\"I won't say how they respond. They take their shirts off and clap their boobs together for you\""]
["07:45,940","07:51,860","\"One of the funniest things you can do is get a girl to clapper boobs together after you pour super glue in between them\""]
["07:51,860","07:56,460","\"You're sick\""]
["07:56,460","08:02,740","\"That brought you\""]
["08:02,740","08:06,860","\"What's that?\""]
["08:06,860","08:14,980","\"Think about it you thinking about it if you pour super glue in between girls big breasts, right?\""]
["08:14,980","08:20,100","\"What if you did it between your big breath? They're not big enough. They're not they're almost but I'm not sure\""]
["08:20,100","08:23,740","\"But if you push if you pour superglue in between breasts, right?\""]
["08:23,740","08:28,780","\"And if you push them together really hard until the nipples meet right in the center\""]
["08:28,780","08:31,540","\"It is a perfect one boob now\""]
["08:31,540","08:36,720","\"As long as it stays clamped together you gotta like hold it together for a good couple hours\""]
["08:36,720","08:39,700","\"But yeah, but that's what uh vices are for\""]
["08:43,700","08:45,960","\"You also need a holder still with duct tape\""]
["08:45,960","08:50,380","\"Dadded nails and barbed wire. I hope you have children and I hope you have daughters\""]
["08:50,380","08:56,700","\"I hope their boobs are huge the day I have the daughters and the day someone sends me this this exact footage\""]
["08:56,700","08:58,660","\"Will be the day I feel really guilty. Yeah, that's right\""]
["08:58,660","09:03,700","\"Some psychos gonna remember what you said here and they're gonna hunt hunt down your daughters\""]
["09:03,700","09:10,300","\"I think about that quite a lot where um, you know have people like Steven Spielberg and movie directors will be really really good\""]
["09:10,300","09:16,060","\"Yeah, and then it almost seems like the second they have kids is the second there's they're like creativity gets ruined\""]
["09:16,060","09:23,420","\"Cuz they're trying to make shit to impress their kids now see I think it's partially that I also think it's partially that they are so tired\""]
["09:23,420","09:30,380","\"When you got kids man your whole I mean I just imagine they're not sleeping anymore. Yeah, it's just hard to be creative\""]
["09:30,380","09:36,580","\"I don't know. Yeah, I could be wrong. I just I want to have kids someday, but I just know it will ruin my life\""]
["09:36,980","09:40,140","\"It's true. Well, at least you're honest having a kid ruins your life\""]
["09:40,140","09:43,820","\"I was gonna say like that's the reminder. I get like I\""]
["09:43,820","09:49,700","\"Mean you love it. You love it dearly with more than like you cannot possibly love anything\""]
["09:49,700","09:55,220","\"More than your own child these neighbors that I think just like secretly hate us because like we're the one couple in our apartment\""]
["09:55,220","10:00,300","\"Complex that don't have kids that don't have kids. Yeah, and they always see how happy we look\""]
["10:00,300","10:04,640","\"Honestly, I'm pretty mad at you for not having kids -\""]
["10:05,220","10:11,220","\"Man fuck you. You know they say that single or single people live longer. Why healthier lives\""]
["10:11,220","10:17,720","\"Mendingle or childless well, I think that I find I think the tears are single as most healthy\""]
["10:17,720","10:25,140","\"Married but without children is is probably second and then married with children. You're done. I\""]
["10:25,140","10:29,180","\"Just think about when I first got my dog when she was a puppy she was\""]
["10:29,180","10:32,300","\"seriously the most annoying\""]
["10:32,500","10:37,500","\"Unlikeable stupid. She's wouldn't stop crying. She wouldn't stop shitting pissing\""]
["10:37,500","10:41,060","\"Ruining my day every day breaking shit tearing shit up\""]
["10:41,060","10:45,220","\"You know and then now she's good, but dogs mature quickly, right?\""]
["10:45,220","10:49,420","\"So if you have a baby you essentially have to deal with that for like three or four years straight\""]
["10:49,420","10:52,580","\"And if you have multiple babies worse\""]
["10:52,580","10:59,140","\"But then again you do love it with all of your heart, but then again you have to Chris, huh?\""]
["10:59,140","11:01,860","\"What is wrong with my chin?\""]
["11:01,860","11:03,860","\"Fuckin' a good side.\""]
["11:03,860","11:05,700","\"- You let the kid from one punch, man.\""]
["11:05,700","11:07,620","\"(groaning)\""]
["11:07,620","11:08,460","\"Get that.\""]
["11:08,460","11:10,820","\"Okay, get the question fart.\""]
["11:10,820","11:12,220","\"- Oh no! - It's a gravity.\""]
["11:12,220","11:13,060","\"- What does that do?\""]
["11:13,060","11:14,900","\"- I fucking hate these.\""]
["11:14,900","11:15,740","\"- You know what we find?\""]
["11:15,740","11:16,740","\"- Oh, it delays?\""]
["11:16,740","11:18,180","\"- Yeah, it's fine, we'll be fine.\""]
["11:18,180","11:20,340","\"- Oh, but you can choose where they shoot.\""]
["11:20,340","11:21,180","\"- Kind of.\""]
["11:21,180","11:24,900","\"They shoot in the direction that I'm facing at the time.\""]
["11:24,900","11:28,460","\"But they can run into them too.\""]
["11:28,460","11:30,020","\"- That is very strange.\""]
