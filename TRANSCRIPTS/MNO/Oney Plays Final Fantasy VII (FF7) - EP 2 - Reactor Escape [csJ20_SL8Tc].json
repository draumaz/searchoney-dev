["08:25,160","08:27,160","\"Let's train at a sector 8 station!\""]
["08:27,160","08:29,160","\"Last stop is sector 7 train blah blah\""]
["08:29,160","08:31,160","\"The train graveyard\""]
["08:31,160","08:34,160","\"All this punk guy is everywhere at the beginning of this game\""]
["08:34,160","08:35,160","\"This girlfriend is hot though\""]
["08:35,160","08:39,160","\"God Barry, you're so fucking rude\""]
["08:39,160","08:44,600","\"This is why I hate the last train.\""]
["08:44,600","08:46,600","\"Oh boy.\""]
["08:46,600","08:56,840","\"This train hasn't switched to security mode yet.\""]
["08:56,840","08:58,840","\"I'm sure that will change by tomorrow.\""]
["08:58,840","09:02,520","\"Hey, perpetuation, you want to look at this one?\""]
["09:02,520","09:05,280","\"It's a map of the Midgar rail system.\""]
["09:05,280","09:06,280","\"Let's look at it together.\""]
["09:06,280","09:08,240","\"I'll explain it to you.\""]
["09:08,240","09:09,500","\"I like this kind of stuff.\""]
["09:09,500","09:12,180","\"Bombs and monitors, you know, flashy stuff.\""]
["09:12,180","09:14,920","\"Actually, this is more like terrorism, but okay.\""]
["09:14,920","09:16,420","\"Okay, it's about to start.\""]
["09:16,420","09:19,620","\"Wow, looks like shit.\""]
["09:19,620","09:22,280","\"This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.\""]
["09:22,280","09:25,260","\"It's about a one to 10,000 scale.\""]
["09:25,260","09:26,500","\"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\""]
["09:26,500","09:27,340","\"You can zoom in on it.\""]
["09:27,340","09:28,860","\"It's a 3D model.\""]
["09:28,860","09:32,380","\"The top plate is about 50 meters above the ground.\""]
["09:32,380","09:35,220","\"A main pillar supports the plate in the center,\""]
["09:35,220","09:37,180","\"and there are other support pillars\""]
["09:37,180","09:39,180","\"built in each section.\""]
["09:39,180","09:41,180","\"B-st-whisper-whisper.\""]
["09:41,180","09:44,180","\"The number one reactor we blew up was in the northern section.\""]
["09:44,180","09:48,180","\"Then there's number two, number three, all the way up to the number eight reactor.\""]
["09:48,180","09:51,180","\"The eight reactors provide Midgar with electricity.\""]
["09:51,180","09:55,180","\"Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.\""]
["09:55,180","09:57,180","\"Wow, world building.\""]
["09:57,180","10:00,180","\"Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors.\""]
["10:00,180","10:02,180","\"That's how things turned out.\""]
["10:02,180","10:04,180","\"Here, look what's next.\""]
["10:04,180","10:05,180","\"Look.\""]
["10:05,180","10:07,180","\"This is the route the train is on.\""]
["10:07,180","10:12,060","\"This route spirals around the main pillar. We should be coming around the center right about now.\""]
["10:12,060","10:15,380","\"Each checkpoint has an ID sensor device.\""]
["10:15,380","10:21,580","\"It checks and then data files the backgrounds of each passenger on the train and is linked up with the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.\""]
["10:21,580","10:24,380","\"We definitely look suspicious so are you.\""]
["10:24,380","10:29,740","\"Ready.\""]
["10:30,740","10:35,140","\"Because of demo that light means that we're in the ID security check area\""]
["10:35,140","10:39,400","\"Well, you let's go off. You never know what kind of creeps come out\""]
["10:39,400","10:41,940","\"We're almost back now water relief\""]
["10:41,940","10:45,140","\"Hi, ah\""]
["10:45,140","10:49,600","\"Fuck you dude fucking asshole\""]
["10:49,600","10:55,240","\"Snore hip-beep-beep-be snore don't actually damn big by lack man\""]
["10:57,540","11:03,380","\"Look you can see the surface now. The city don't have no day or night. If that plate weren't in the sky\""]
["11:03,380","11:05,380","\"I mean we're there you can see the sky\""]
["11:05,380","11:15,500","\"The clouds fucking tightly last floating city pretty unsettling scenery\""]
["11:15,500","11:24,500","\"Huh never expect that to come out of someone like you use it's full of surprises\""]
["11:24,500","11:29,500","\"The upper world is sitting on a plate.\""]
["11:29,500","11:34,500","\"It's 'cause of that fucking pizza that people underneath are suffering.\""]
["11:34,500","11:38,500","\"And the city below is full of polluted air.\""]
["11:38,500","11:44,500","\"On top of that, the reactor keeps draining up all the energy.\""]
["11:44,500","11:48,500","\"Then why doesn't everybody move on to the plate?\""]
["11:48,500","11:50,500","\"I don't know.\""]
["11:50,500","11:52,500","\"Probably 'cause they ain't got no money.\""]
["11:52,500","11:54,500","\"Or maybe?\""]
["11:54,500","11:58,500","\"'Cause they love the land no matter how polluted it gets.\""]
["11:58,500","12:00,500","\"I know.\""]
["12:00,500","12:03,500","\"No one lives in the slums because they want to.\""]
["12:03,500","12:05,500","\"It's like this train.\""]
["12:05,500","12:07,500","\"It can't run anywhere.\""]
