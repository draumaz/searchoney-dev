["02:54,040","03:02,800","\"They have a history of conquest in space because apparently when you die you get your own\""]
["03:02,800","03:03,800","\"planet.\""]
["03:03,800","03:08,040","\"So they're all, they're actually more like Saiyans than like...\""]
["03:08,040","03:09,040","\"That's awesome.\""]
["03:09,040","03:10,040","\"Yeah.\""]

["03:17,200","03:19,520","\"Convince them that they can become Super Saiyans.\""]

["03:22,280","03:25,800","\"Yeah, that's right. When they go super safe.\""]
["03:25,800","03:28,600","\"Man, this is a fun road trip. Let's go off road.\""]
["03:28,600","03:30,840","\"Let's have a look at the Grand Canyon.\""]
["03:30,840","03:34,160","\"Oh, Chris.\""]
["03:34,160","03:42,680","\"That angle, that fish island.\""]
["03:42,680","03:47,800","\"All right. I think Hopper.\""]
["03:47,800","03:50,600","\"He's done hopping. No, we can do that again.\""]
["03:50,600","03:52,600","\"You\""]
["03:52,600","03:59,020","\"Second you hit the rewind button it fixes your car, right? Yep. Oh my wheels took in the ground. Oh, no\""]
["03:59,020","04:03,360","\"That is a weird little glitch there you go. You're back out. What is going on? There you are\""]
["04:03,360","04:09,300","\"This is a this is weird. Oh, no is the gravity go up? What's up?\""]
["04:09,300","04:14,540","\"Something's going on and you're weird. You're real. You're tired. Keep getting stuck. That is weird\""]
["04:14,540","04:19,700","\"I think it's because of the angle at which it's like placing you on this road. That is because it's so hot\""]
["04:19,780","04:25,420","\"Your tires are melting into the asphalt. Yeah, this is that yeah, there we go perfect\""]
["04:25,420","04:27,140","\"Yeah, it was just because of the incline\""]
["04:27,140","04:32,580","\"It's a it's a glitch in the way that it resets your vehicle. You know they should not have released this game with such a bad glitch\""]
["04:32,580","04:34,620","\"They should not\""]
["04:34,620","04:36,620","\"They should not have released this really\""]
["04:36,620","04:44,500","\"Majorially fun game. Yeah, I was gonna say this is a great basis for a lot of like a really complex fun game\""]
["04:44,500","04:47,780","\"This kid yeah, they should sell this story or action or something\""]
["04:47,780","04:49,220","\"I mean, it feels like that's what it was.\""]
["04:49,220","04:52,020","\"Like, they put in a bunch of effort, they made this engine,\""]
["04:52,020","04:54,380","\"and then they're like, \"\"Shit, we just...\"\"\""]
["04:54,380","04:55,660","\"What do we do is?\""]
["04:55,660","05:00,060","\"They should really give it to someone else to make a little world with people in it.\""]
["05:00,060","05:02,020","\"Maybe that was their intention all along.\""]
["05:02,020","05:02,900","\"Maybe, I hope.\""]
["05:02,900","05:05,100","\"Maybe that's the update, guys.\""]
["05:05,100","05:06,500","\"Oh my God, that was the perfect drift.\""]
["05:06,500","05:07,060","\"Do you see that?\""]
["05:07,060","05:08,740","\"Yeah, that was perfect, Chris.\""]

["05:10,220","05:11,580","\"You're very good at drifting.\""]

["05:16,060","05:22,820","\"What are you doing drifting on your side look at this yeah, dude, it's called flipping your car over with no effort\""]
["05:22,820","05:26,940","\"Never mind\""]
["05:26,940","05:30,380","\"Can you get up there oh yeah good idea? Oh\""]

["05:34,740","05:37,180","\"Can you gravity yourself up?\""]
["05:37,180","05:41,500","\"Onto the mountains like if you're driving forward and then you\""]
["05:42,020","05:48,760","\"Like you're rolling forward and the afford momentum and then you release gravity. Yeah, and then increase it slowly\""]
["05:48,760","05:55,500","\"Is there a shortcut for gravity? Let's pull over here for sure. Yeah, let's pull over check out our gravity in the glove box\""]
["05:55,500","05:57,980","\"How about one of you holds the controller while the other?\""]
["05:57,980","06:05,100","\"Manipulates the keyboard that were you need to go to environment and then go to gravity. Okay. I can do this\""]
["06:05,100","06:08,300","\"Okay, I can't see though. How do I change? Oh?\""]
["06:08,300","06:10,300","\"Oh no.\""]

["06:24,300","06:25,300","\"All right.\""]
["06:25,300","06:26,300","\"Get some momentum.\""]
["06:26,300","06:29,300","\"Oh, it'd be right on the deep end, but just do it.\""]
["06:29,300","06:31,300","\"Okay, you got momentum.\""]
["06:31,300","06:32,300","\"Where going?\""]

["09:04,640","09:10,520","\"Oh yes, reverse just a little bit. Oh, this is going to be great.\""]
["09:10,520","09:14,760","\"All right, Omar. Now you got to say the thing from start from fucking back to the future.\""]
["09:14,760","09:21,080","\"When this when this baby where we're going, we don't need roads. No.\""]
["09:21,080","09:45,540","\"*sings* Holy shit. Dude, that's awesome. Rewind to do it again. Morning. Morning, your\""]
["09:45,540","09:49,840","\"Mangle you're how do you reverse you dang straight you fucking shit\""]
["09:49,840","09:52,540","\"What am I just gonna\""]
["09:52,540","09:57,620","\"Okay, here we go you ready yeah\""]
["09:57,620","10:03,580","\"Goodbye my son why did you say?\""]
["10:03,580","10:08,900","\"Look at that oh nice landing oh\""]
["10:08,900","10:14,340","\"We wait what's slow mo can you do slow mo oh?\""]
["10:14,340","10:16,140","\"Ah\""]
["10:16,140","10:19,020","\"It's supposed to be all right all the all right\""]
["10:19,020","10:22,060","\"It's not the all right though\""]
["10:22,060","10:28,860","\"I don't I wish to was a slow mobile and for the remote control here you said you wanted to drive to a bridge right?\""]
["10:28,860","10:34,180","\"Yeah, there was a bridge somewhere. I don't know where it was though. Well, how you know what driving to the\""]
["10:34,180","10:38,060","\"Whoa, I want to know this was not meant to be driven\""]
["10:38,060","10:43,340","\"I want to know how you do that a track builder camera where you can just drop the camera and drive around\""]
["10:43,340","10:48,400","\"I like that this world was not meant to be driven keep going\""]
["10:48,400","10:53,200","\"I want to see how far you can go into this into this nether region of the game. Okay\""]
["10:53,200","11:02,180","\"Is this just a wall I guess we'll find out\""]
["11:02,180","11:06,660","\"I have to float over this wall\""]
["11:06,660","11:12,200","\"Yeah, how far can we go that looks like a big-ass ramp we can just drive up. Yeah, let's find out what happens\""]
["11:12,780","11:18,820","\"Here we go. Oh, we're not near it yet. Did it just go forever? We're pretty far from it. Oh, there we go\""]
["11:18,820","11:24,260","\"That was so cool\""]
["11:24,260","11:32,020","\"I loved every second that come from let's just came out of nowhere. Let's okay, we go\""]
["11:32,020","11:35,540","\"We're gonna have to enter this from a strange angle. I think\""]
["11:35,540","11:42,260","\"We might need to do the gravity hack again. We can just do this. Oh, I want to see how far\""]
["11:42,260","11:46,260","\"They programmed this even though there's like obvious shit textures here\""]
["11:46,260","11:50,180","\"You can drive up it adding a hip-box ain't the hardest thing you know\""]
["11:50,180","11:54,040","\"Go go go. Oh one of my wheels is fuck\""]
["11:54,040","11:59,680","\"How about we get that old race car out here. Oh, yeah\""]
["11:59,680","12:09,800","\"Yeah, give me the race get that race cars just rip it out. There you go. Oh little guy go please\""]
["12:11,100","12:18,500","\"Whoa, holy crap the world continues holy how fucking far did they program this? I don't know. Oh\""]
["12:18,500","12:26,000","\"Shit, it just keeps going. Oh my god. You're gonna get up there. I could sure as hell try mister. You sure can I?\""]
["12:26,000","12:29,620","\"Love exploring boundaries. Oh, I\""]
["12:29,620","12:32,300","\"Want us to eventually fall off the world?\""]
["12:32,300","12:38,720","\"I think that's gonna dream that's gonna happen over here. I think Chris. I feel like you have an issue with boundaries\""]
["12:38,720","12:45,700","\"Yeah, I do I love to cross them crossing boundaries and one of the most sexually romantic things you can do oh\""]
["12:45,700","12:49,960","\"I think I broke some talk to your partner about crossing\""]
["12:49,960","12:56,260","\"Doctor Phil says that if you've been crossing boundaries for over 12 hours\""]
["12:56,260","13:02,560","\"Crossing as many boundaries as you can oh what more dude\""]
["13:04,800","13:11,160","\"Let's go to these ones. Yeah, I bet we're gonna fall through the ground. That's probably a skybox you think\""]
["13:11,160","13:15,960","\"We're getting closer to it. Why why would you even program this is like a\""]
["13:15,960","13:21,960","\"Doesn't get any closer at all. It feels like it's sinking wait really\""]
["13:21,960","13:26,320","\"Is it really definitely getting closer? Oh?\""]
["13:26,320","13:29,960","\"We're going so fucking fast. Oh my god. We're going to see\""]
["13:31,160","13:38,260","\"Zippy-doo. Oh, I'm turning to the right. I don't know why that's the gravitational pull at this height\""]
["13:38,260","13:45,060","\"Go who go who go oh whoa? Oh?\""]
["13:45,060","13:55,660","\"Perfect yes keep going keep going daddy's okay. Oh\""]
["13:55,660","13:58,500","\"There's my little tire\""]
["13:59,220","14:02,960","\"Okay, just a scratch dude. I really Jesus scratch\""]
["14:02,960","14:06,320","\"This is the greatest video game environment of our age dude\""]
["14:06,320","14:11,400","\"Why don't more people know about this this has to be the end up here. I'm sure it's how it looks like it\""]
["14:11,400","14:13,400","\"Oh, yeah, the world kind of looks like it\""]
["14:13,400","14:21,920","\"Can we drive back now and just fly into the fucking level I\""]
["14:21,920","14:28,280","\"Think you're gonna go so fast that even when you hit just like normal ground you're\""]
["14:28,280","14:35,280","\"Yeah, I really wish we had a slow mo thing figured out for this part. Yeah, I really want to see the impact in slow motion\""]
["14:35,280","14:39,200","\"Here you go. Oh my bonnet. Are my trunk?\""]
["14:39,200","14:44,360","\"That's pretty fine. Oh my god. You were good. You got some speed\""]
["14:44,360","14:48,880","\"What god to do it? Okay, so right okay, so I'm holding down alt. It's not doing anything\""]
["14:48,880","14:51,160","\"Yeah, it doesn't work\""]
["14:51,160","14:54,900","\"That's uh, that's a big old bummer. I know I'm a really oh my god\""]
["14:55,600","15:01,120","\"You you fast car, which where are we going rate five stars?\""]
["15:01,120","15:11,700","\"That's so fucking satisfying this is what the afterlife actually looks\""]
["15:11,700","15:22,080","\"Kind of I've been there have you yeah, it looks pretty much exactly like what you said Ted temporary brain death. Yeah, I died\""]
["15:23,120","15:25,120","\"What was it like exactly?\""]
["15:25,120","15:28,520","\"Actually Chris. Hmm. Can you pause real good? Mmm?\""]
["15:28,520","15:33,980","\"What if you take the gravity and just make it moon gravity\""]
["15:33,980","15:40,960","\"Well actually your tires don't grip to the floor when you do that at all pretty little the less gravity the less aggressive\""]
["15:40,960","15:45,760","\"I was gonna say just ever so slightly less gravity. I wonder. Can we bring up that menu? Oh?\""]
["15:45,760","15:50,560","\"No, did I reset it? Oh, you can bring up the menu while pause. So that's good to know\""]
["15:51,280","15:54,760","\"So we can get to a part and then just like slow it down\""]
["15:54,760","15:57,960","\"Okay, you ready? Yeah\""]
["15:57,960","16:04,020","\"Oh, you mean at full speed and then pause right before the cliff. Yeah, and then pause change gravity and go\""]
["16:04,020","16:07,920","\"Okay, was this Mick I see something I see some\""]
["16:07,920","16:16,680","\"Getting you down to another world. It's just another layer of fucking third earth or whatever the fuck we are\""]
["16:18,200","16:23,240","\"That's the the Thundercats planet. So let's see if any of this shit actually worked out\""]
["16:23,240","16:32,020","\"Up is real two times slower is yeah four times lower eight times real time cool. Okay, so let's try it\""]
["16:32,020","16:41,920","\"That is the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life\""]
["16:44,960","16:49,580","\"That's so cool. All right, okay. We got it now. You're ready. Are you ready?\""]
["16:49,580","16:53,560","\"You ready for the race you ready to\""]
["16:53,560","17:04,760","\"Hit this thing yeah, here we go\""]
["17:04,760","17:08,760","\"Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.\""]
["17:08,760","17:11,100","\"(screaming)\""]
["17:11,100","17:19,520","\"(laughing)\""]
["17:19,520","17:21,480","\"- That is the most satisfying thing.\""]
["17:21,480","17:25,020","\"- Look at that rear bumper just flipping around.\""]
["17:25,020","17:25,840","\"- Yeah.\""]
["17:25,840","17:31,020","\"- That's got actually really good, like, the physics in the bumper.\""]
["17:31,020","17:33,260","\"- Yeah, it's amazing. - I was fucking sick.\""]
["17:33,260","17:37,120","\"The sparks fucking are we ever gonna get back to town?\""]
["17:37,120","17:44,580","\"We have a long way away sure did I think there was ever a town. Oh, it's over here. I think I think I see shit\""]
["17:44,580","17:49,360","\"No, yeah, that looks like the right way. Let's get a really good speed go in here\""]
["17:49,360","17:56,560","\"Tell me you're my little weedy speedster, you know that you know, we're recording this on 420. Oh, yeah\""]
["17:56,560","18:02,120","\"You're right just FYI that really makes me kind of want to this looks kind of dangerous\""]
["18:02,120","18:04,120","\"Oh, yes\""]
["18:04,120","18:06,120","\"Yes\""]
["18:06,120","18:17,120","\"That is the coolest shit I've ever seen\""]
["18:17,120","18:22,120","\"Baskin that glory mick\""]
["18:22,120","18:29,960","\"How much slower is that 16 this game just got 16 times cooler can we go back to the cliff yes, please? Oh what the fuck oh?\""]
["18:31,080","18:37,000","\"That's far back as we can go. Can you also change the gravity just a little bit are you gonna try to land on the bridge gravity is\""]
["18:37,000","18:39,560","\"on the bridge oh\""]
["18:39,560","18:44,120","\"We'll change gravity at last second. Yeah. Yeah, okay last second. So you got some speed\""]
["18:44,120","18:47,320","\"Right before we hit this thing will change gravity\""]
["18:47,320","18:53,640","\"Here are come baby. I feel like your smash isn't gonna be as satisfying with lower gravity. Yeah\""]
["18:53,640","18:59,240","\"It'll get us further here. We go. You ready? Oh my okay, so we're gonna turn down the gravity\""]
["18:59,440","19:03,160","\"Now you do that with this and this and\""]
["19:03,160","19:12,560","\"These you're gonna do moon gravity. Oh, yeah, moon minus 1.62. That's how much this is not much difference. Oh\""]
["19:12,560","19:15,320","\"my god\""]
["19:15,320","19:20,320","\"Okay, oh\""]
["19:20,320","19:24,080","\"My god soft landing soft landing my headlights on\""]
["19:24,080","19:27,280","\"He looks like you're gonna do perfectly. Oh\""]
["19:27,280","19:36,960","\"Oh my fuel take ruptured. Oh man. That's fun. Yeah, my let's run.\""]
["19:36,960","19:45,440","\"The way the car flexes is really satisfying. Yeah, I fucking could watch this for hours.\""]
["19:45,440","19:52,400","\"It's actually timed out pretty well.\""]
["19:55,680","20:01,760","\"Oh, oh my oh oh good call with the moon gravity\""]
["20:01,760","20:09,320","\"Once I go to stop never oh\""]
["20:09,320","20:14,280","\"Land and there you go perfect perfect part job\""]
["20:14,280","20:25,120","\"But in another world we went real fucking oh that is so fucking trippy Wow, okay. Let's last time you ready. Yes\""]
["20:25,120","20:30,040","\"Oh yeah we should do it from this angle. Oh yeah.\""]
["20:30,040","20:35,040","\"[SINGING]\""]
