["07:28,040","07:30,400","\"- You know, I've heard that if you have a big, big tapeworm\""]
["07:30,400","07:31,640","\"you put sugar on the end of your tongue\""]
["07:31,640","07:33,960","\"and sit there with your mouth open for a bit.\""]
["07:33,960","07:36,320","\"It'll crawl up through your body and try to eat the sugar.\""]
["07:36,320","07:37,600","\"- See, we've all heard different versions\""]

["08:18,560","08:24,160","\"And then the bird then they can propagate through the bird shitting all over the place really yeah, really oh\""]
["08:24,160","08:30,680","\"Yeah, sounds like a nightmare. Yeah, have you thought something like that that could affect people it would be if you\""]

["09:04,080","09:07,600","\"You can kind of tell where they are like I didn't have a key\""]
["09:07,600","09:11,320","\"So I couldn't get the item for this but I really wanted a key\""]
["09:11,320","09:16,000","\"So I had to I had to finagle my way into this room cool and now I can go get the item\""]

["09:29,960","09:35,140","\"And if you come back in he kills you it's like the class with a command man what yeah\""]
["09:35,140","09:40,080","\"Yeah, oh my god. No, I have not I don't remember that it means you can never go back to the shop now\""]

["11:09,000","11:16,080","\"builds and so I mean look for anybody you can get sick of a game sure but it has but you've never gotten\""]
["11:16,080","11:21,520","\"I haven't it has so much replayability just because it changes so much every single time like even right now\""]
["11:21,840","11:29,640","\"This build is oh fuck yeah one heart one heart one heart death. Whoa what happened your head? I have a I have a\""]
["11:29,640","11:36,400","\"Gypsy a gypsy thing on my face watch out. Yeah, they're a little bass. It's\""]
["11:36,400","11:41,220","\"Yeah, one heart one heart death. I need to get some fucking help\""]
["11:41,220","11:44,600","\"There we go. This is gonna help. This is good. This is cool\""]
["11:44,600","11:46,920","\"These guys suck because they can fucking chuck shit\""]
["11:46,920","11:51,240","\"So how many like variables you think are in the game that make it so different every time?\""]
["11:51,240","11:58,800","\"Um, well beyond just like the randomized levels between the items themselves, there's like hundreds and hundreds of items\""]
["11:58,800","12:01,120","\"hundreds\""]
["12:01,120","12:03,120","\"Should I get poo water? Yeah\""]
["12:03,120","12:04,960","\"Okay\""]
["12:04,960","12:06,800","\"Shared shots\""]
["12:06,800","12:12,440","\"Yes, and so do any of the items have negative drawbacks? So yeah, kind of\""]
["12:12,440","12:19,380","\"There's one item in particular called the crystal skull, which I don't even know why it's in this game. Oh wait this character can fly over holes\""]
["12:19,520","12:23,080","\"Yeah, that's why I start with this character so we can kind of just like bypass some shit\""]
["12:23,080","12:26,440","\"This makes the game a lot easier cuz spikes like I can't get hit by spikes\""]
["12:26,440","12:27,280","\"Oh\""]
["12:27,280","12:35,520","\"Um, but the crystal skull when you get hit once you fucking start like you it'll make you start over from the outside of the room\""]
["12:35,520","12:38,360","\"Which means any progress you had is gone\""]
["12:38,360","12:42,960","\"So that can that can suck and then there's something cool. I think soy milk where\""]
["12:43,920","12:49,720","\"It gives you like little tiny little bead tears. They're really fast, but they're like totally useless\""]
["12:49,720","12:53,600","\"You're my little soyman. Should I give him money or should I murder him?\""]
["12:53,600","12:55,440","\"Kill it\""]

["13:50,780","13:52,380","\"Yeah, it was like smoother.\""]
["13:52,380","13:53,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["13:53,380","13:54,380","\"And now it's pixel art.\""]

["13:59,380","14:01,860","\"I thought it was a flash game, right?\""]
["14:01,860","14:02,860","\"Was it?\""]
["14:02,860","14:03,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["14:03,860","14:05,660","\"There was a flash version on Newgrounds.\""]

["14:40,300","14:44,100","\"I don't hate me boy, I just prefer Isaac a lot.\""]
["14:44,100","14:45,260","\"And then there was that new game\""]
["14:45,260","14:47,420","\"that they were doing, like this card thing.\""]
["14:47,420","14:49,060","\"And maybe I'm just not giving it a chance\""]
["14:49,060","14:51,340","\"because I got starry eyes for Isaac,\""]
["14:51,340","14:54,660","\"but it just doesn't look, it doesn't entice my,\""]
["14:54,660","14:57,740","\"doesn't make my gonads tingle.\""]
["14:57,740","15:00,020","\"- I will say, I like,\""]
["15:00,020","15:03,300","\"I like games with consequence.\""]
["15:03,300","15:04,140","\"- Yeah.\""]
["15:04,140","15:06,020","\"- And I felt like Meat Boy didn't have any.\""]

["15:07,860","15:08,700","\"- Yeah.\""]
["15:08,700","15:09,740","\"- This has the ultimate consequence.\""]
["15:09,740","15:10,780","\"Yeah, I like that.\""]
["15:10,780","15:14,420","\"You build this character, you fucking rock and roll,\""]
["15:14,420","15:15,860","\"and you could be playing for hours\""]
["15:15,860","15:18,340","\"and then get one item, if you don't know the items,\""]
["15:18,340","15:20,420","\"get one item out of the hundreds\""]
["15:20,420","15:23,640","\"that fucks your build, and you're just done.\""]
["15:23,640","15:24,480","\"I just like--\""]
["15:24,480","15:26,940","\"All those hours, all that effort for not--\""]
["15:26,940","15:31,180","\"I like the mischievous and pushing how far I can do something.\""]
["15:31,180","15:32,820","\"And then if I die, I know I fucked up,\""]
["15:32,820","15:34,860","\"and it's my fault, but I was your fault.\""]
["15:34,860","15:37,060","\"I don't like, you remember Fez?\""]
["15:37,060","15:37,900","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:37,900","15:42,220","\"like no consequence in that either and it like that's why I never liked it really\""]
["15:42,220","15:48,620","\"but I do like end game in this in this yeah yeah yeah there's like when you get to\""]
["15:48,620","15:54,900","\"that skull level is that technically the end of your run or kind sometimes you\""]
["15:54,900","16:00,660","\"can go beyond far beyond the yeah but yeah there are endings there's multiple\""]
["16:00,660","16:07,180","\"endings depending on how far how many things you've unlocked and stuff this\""]
["16:07,180","16:09,900","\"This is not an OP run, by the way.\""]
["16:09,900","16:11,560","\"This is...\""]
["16:11,560","16:14,100","\"But there are ways to actually kind of break this game.\""]
["16:14,100","16:15,580","\"If you get the right combo of things,\""]
["16:15,580","16:19,900","\"especially in Greed mode, you can break this game so hard.\""]
["16:19,900","16:23,300","\"We had entire screen just full of every item in the game.\""]
["16:23,300","16:24,420","\"- Really? - Oh yeah.\""]
["16:24,420","16:25,500","\"And we got so many of them.\""]
["16:25,500","16:26,500","\"It started re...\""]
["16:26,500","16:29,060","\"Basically, it doesn't recycle the items.\""]
["16:29,060","16:31,220","\"They all default to breakfast,\""]
["16:31,220","16:34,060","\"which is a health thing you can get.\""]
["16:34,060","16:35,580","\"- Oh, get that. - Yay or nay.\""]
["16:35,580","16:37,220","\"Yeah. All right. Looks like a dummy book.\""]

["16:39,060","16:42,300","\"Fucking. I didn't say I think it would actually say for dummies.\""]
["16:42,300","16:45,380","\"But what was it going to say?\""]
["16:45,380","16:49,260","\"Is is this company call team meat?\""]
["16:49,260","16:50,460","\"Does team meat make Isaac?\""]
["16:50,460","16:52,580","\"Is it? No, it's called.\""]
["16:52,580","16:54,580","\"This is made by Knight.\""]

["17:47,220","17:49,780","\"There will be a point though, like if we get a Satan room\""]
["17:49,780","17:51,660","\"where like we just physically can't even get all,\""]
["17:51,660","17:53,300","\"well actually with eight lives, we could get everything.\""]
["17:53,300","17:55,060","\"- What is a Satan room?\""]

["18:04,740","18:07,280","\"Those are randomized, and there's also angel rooms,\""]
["18:07,280","18:08,780","\"but because we grabbed a Satan item,\""]
["18:08,780","18:10,620","\"I think angel rooms are out of the question.\""]
["18:10,620","18:11,620","\"They stopped spawning.\""]

["18:17,620","18:19,740","\"a fan-made version, really.\""]
["18:19,740","18:21,820","\"I think it's called Antibirth,\""]
