["04:41,260","04:44,240","\"So that's who I am. I'm just the guy who got rounded up and put in here\""]
["04:44,240","04:50,320","\"So I have the curse here a dead man. Yeah the curse of the undead just means that when you die just the more you die\""]

["05:57,560","05:58,560","\"What is this head?\""]
["05:58,560","06:01,560","\"That must feel really gross.\""]
["06:01,560","06:03,560","\"Being a dead man?\""]
["06:03,560","06:04,560","\"Covered in strength.\""]
["06:04,560","06:06,560","\"Oh, damn, that's cool.\""]
["06:06,560","06:09,560","\"It's a cool game, Julie, and I'm telling you.\""]
["06:09,560","06:11,560","\"I'm glad we're playing it.\""]
["06:11,560","06:16,560","\"I used to watch my roommates play it and I didn't get a good look at any of the characters or anything,\""]
["06:16,560","06:19,320","\"I like how the environments look.\""]
["06:19,320","06:20,160","\"I have a big...\""]
["06:20,160","06:22,880","\"- You probably didn't get much of a look of the game either.\""]
["06:22,880","06:27,880","\"I have a big interest in labyrinthine settings\""]
["06:27,880","06:30,480","\"that you can wander around in and it looked really cool.\""]
["06:30,480","06:32,480","\"- I just like how run down everything looks.\""]
["06:32,480","06:35,000","\"It's real gritty.\""]
["06:35,000","06:39,240","\"They'll put in the door and look who it is, Jules.\""]
["06:39,240","06:41,300","\"- It's okay, you just run away.\""]
["06:41,300","06:43,880","\"- Look at that, Jules.\""]
["06:45,520","06:50,160","\"of the angels. You're not supposed to see him. You're not supposed to look at him. He's\""]
["06:50,160","07:00,240","\"supposed to scare you. Oh, that guy. That's crayed. Oh, you got the music on. Oh, okay.\""]
["07:00,240","07:04,680","\"Watch out for the funny thing on the stairs. What funny thing? Oh, yes, fire. You don't\""]
["07:04,680","07:11,080","\"want to get bonkered. Julian, these are checkpoints. You got to sit down at them and then if you\""]
["07:11,080","07:13,080","\"die that's what will reappear\""]
["07:13,080","07:23,200","\"oh oh why's that lady spitting at you she shoot me little arrows it's a boy\""]
["07:23,200","07:29,920","\"but Chris how do you know well maybe she's undergone a little surgery book\""]
["07:29,920","07:36,960","\"Chris the anatomy of a male hit her with the baseball bat she has she has\""]
["07:36,960","07:43,040","\"the in anime. I like that shield. Knock her out of the park. It's a real smelly shield.\""]
["07:43,040","07:48,640","\"You gotta give him a good break. No, he can't. No. Oh no. Why'd you hurt him? Because he was\""]
["07:48,640","07:54,320","\"being a little shit. You could just sneak it. The hair doesn't. Yeah, what was that? It's just\""]
["07:54,320","08:00,640","\"the old glitch. Why didn't they do that? This is fun. Watch out. Oh my god. Chris, I warned you\""]
["08:00,640","08:07,640","\"ahead of time. I know about it. I've played this a trillion times. You goof. You're trying\""]
["08:07,640","08:14,080","\"to do to me. Is that why you always go blibber? What? That's the big tumble. What did you\""]
["08:14,080","08:18,520","\"say Julius? I said is that why you always go blibber? Yes. Because you're being one\""]
["08:18,520","08:24,080","\"of these goulions. Blibber, blah, blah. No one's from Hotel Frank Convaini. Yeah, remember\""]
["08:24,080","08:26,480","\"Adam Sandler says you put in my boo boo\""]
["08:26,480","08:31,640","\"See Julian this guy says you want some apple juice\""]
["08:31,640","08:34,120","\"Yeah\""]
["08:34,120","08:36,120","\"Then he dies\""]
["08:36,120","08:44,460","\"He's boring you can go die and be boring elsewhere\""]
["08:44,460","08:48,680","\"See Julian see my health at the top. Yeah, you drink a little juice all better. Wow\""]
["08:50,000","08:54,220","\"Remember the flask that gave out Dark Souls 3. It was just a little so\""]
["08:54,220","09:00,100","\"It was funny like one of those things you put a penny in a machine\""]
["09:00,100","09:03,120","\"It makes a little wax\""]
["09:03,120","09:15,280","\"Like a really expensive limited edition thing - that's the thing about game limited editions is they always have those awful prizes\""]
["09:15,280","09:18,840","\"And they're never fucking good. Why do you said it?\""]
["09:18,840","09:25,760","\"Didn't they have a limited edition crash bandicoot that we could have got they did you get a fidget spinner with it? Oh, that's right\""]
["09:25,760","09:36,520","\"I think it was over here. Look at these tubby fella. It's not I was saying to like if they seemed it\""]
["09:36,520","09:40,160","\"Like crash bandicoot it would make sense because crush bandicoot spins\""]
["09:40,160","09:44,880","\"But it's just camouflage pattern. It's just a random fidget spinner\""]
["09:45,480","09:51,560","\"They were probably trying to empty out stock or something. Yeah, it was just like blue. Yeah. Yeah, that's all it was\""]
["09:51,560","09:54,320","\"It's just blue camouflage. I'm pretty sure it was Ireland\""]
["09:54,320","09:59,920","\"I was watching a GameStop Ireland video on Facebook beer day out of curiosity\""]
["09:59,920","10:07,040","\"They called everyone cunts. No, it was just some buff Irish breadhead dude who's like no crash man of coach\""]
["10:07,040","10:14,040","\"Amazing good music and brilliant. That was the whole video. It was a Matthew. It was very pretty. I like this\""]
["10:14,840","10:21,080","\"Julian just you wait mister. It's a little over detailed from my taste but like I really like the shapes\""]
["10:21,080","10:25,080","\"they're making out of the environment. But over detailed you mean it looks kind of way too sharp?\""]
["10:25,080","10:30,520","\"No just like there's too many tiny little details. Oh that's chroma.\""]
["10:30,520","10:32,440","\"Attention. Chroma. Why?\""]
["10:32,440","10:39,160","\"See Julian this is a prophecy story. The land of the ancient lords.\""]
["10:39,160","10:42,680","\"Which are bad kinds of stories but this game gets away with it you know why?\""]
["10:43,560","10:45,560","\"Because it's nonsense.\""]
["10:45,560","10:47,560","\"Oh, cuz I too did that.\""]
["10:47,560","10:53,240","\"I mean to my knowledge people don't really care about the story in these games, right?\""]
["10:53,240","10:55,240","\"No, no boy.\""]
["10:55,240","10:56,240","\"Is that not?\""]
["10:56,240","10:57,240","\"The story?\""]
["10:57,240","10:58,240","\"Or do they?\""]
["10:58,240","10:59,240","\"They love.\""]
["10:59,240","11:00,240","\"Yes.\""]
["11:00,240","11:01,240","\"Amazing story.\""]
["11:01,240","11:02,240","\"Okay.\""]
["11:02,240","11:03,240","\"I never hear anybody talk about it.\""]
["11:03,240","11:04,240","\"It's always a game.\""]
["11:04,240","11:06,080","\"There's like a million channels dedicated.\""]
["11:06,080","11:07,920","\"And they're really popular.\""]
["11:07,920","11:11,080","\"It's because it's not all just directly handed to you.\""]
["11:11,080","11:12,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:12,080","11:14,800","\"item descriptions and everything you can piece things together.\""]
["11:14,800","11:16,800","\"That probably is the best way to do it.\""]
["11:16,800","11:18,880","\"It is for games, it's the perfect way to do it.\""]
["11:18,880","11:23,320","\"Like it's easy to accidentally skip over, but it ends up being the most effective if\""]
["11:23,320","11:24,320","\"you're invested.\""]
["11:24,320","11:25,320","\"No, it's awesome.\""]
["11:25,320","11:28,080","\"You have to pay attention to what you're doing and your surroundings, and everything\""]
["11:28,080","11:29,080","\"makes sense usually.\""]
["11:29,080","11:35,760","\"I'm gonna try and just get this really quick item down here, make the game a little easier.\""]
["11:35,760","11:36,760","\"Whoa, Julian!\""]
["11:36,760","11:38,760","\"This is sewer.\""]
["11:38,760","11:40,560","\"That's very pretty.\""]
["11:40,560","11:41,560","\"Pretty sewer.\""]
["11:41,560","11:49,240","\"Seems really big you're gonna get poisoned by a rat down here. No the the rats are in around here\""]
["11:49,240","11:58,000","\"Like that because I can picture you doing it in real life\""]
["11:58,000","12:08,520","\"These people don't do anything. He's crazy\""]
["12:09,760","12:13,640","\"Did you lean this is spook town? Oh there's all kinds of spooks. I\""]
["12:13,640","12:18,680","\"Love a look at the old bridge. That's the pot man. Oh, you found me\""]
["12:18,680","12:24,140","\"My pot man these guys go down real fast, don't they? Well, there's just the first enemy in the game\""]
["12:24,140","12:27,680","\"Not even really enemies\""]
["12:27,680","12:29,640","\"Well, if if you hit him, they're mad\""]
["12:29,640","12:32,080","\"not really\""]
["12:32,080","12:33,600","\"Yeah, I'm really\""]
["12:33,600","12:39,600","\"Do they actually react? Yeah, I don't remember everything they do kids react teens react\""]
["12:39,600","12:42,600","\"How are the fine brothers doing?\""]
["12:42,600","12:43,600","\"They're doing pretty good.\""]
["12:43,600","12:47,600","\"Because YouTube stopped recommending me their videos after that.\""]
["12:47,600","12:49,600","\"They're doing good as bad as I am.\""]
["12:49,600","12:51,600","\"They started recommending them.\""]
["12:51,600","12:52,600","\"Oh, ghosties.\""]
["12:52,600","12:54,600","\"These guys are little biostards.\""]
["12:54,600","12:55,600","\"I love them.\""]
