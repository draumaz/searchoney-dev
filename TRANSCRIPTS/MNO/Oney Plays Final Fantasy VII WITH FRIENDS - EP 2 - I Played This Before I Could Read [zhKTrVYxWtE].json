["00:05,520","00:10,360","\"There's a famous Tumblr post that someone made about all the stupidest enemies in this game, and they're all hilarious.\""]
["00:10,360","00:13,760","\"There's like a ghost ship with a skeleton on the front that wacks you with his paddle.\""]
["00:13,760","00:14,920","\"That sounds fun.\""]
["00:14,920","00:16,360","\"Yeah, but he's in this like...\""]
["00:16,360","00:19,400","\"Hallway in the ground that makes no sense.\""]
["00:19,400","00:20,800","\"There's the okay button.\""]
["00:20,800","00:21,920","\"Push the \"\"Ock\"\" button.\""]

["00:22,520","00:25,800","\"As we do this in this attack, please figure out your controller.\""]
["00:25,800","00:28,280","\"Oh, she's looking right up my leg.\""]
["00:29,440","00:31,440","\"Wait, I think I made that exact same joke.\""]
["00:31,440","00:32,940","\"What?\""]
["00:32,940","00:34,200","\"In my first playthrough.\""]
["00:34,200","00:34,700","\"Oh.\""]
["00:34,700","00:35,880","\"Well, drop the podium.\""]
["00:35,880","00:37,020","\"That never happened, Chris.\""]
["00:37,020","00:37,520","\"Don't worry.\""]
["00:37,520","00:41,520","\"Those guys are cool.\""]
["00:41,520","00:42,600","\"Oh, they're ghosts.\""]
["00:42,600","00:44,080","\"They're gooosts.\""]
["00:44,080","00:46,840","\"They're going to fucking shoot their beam gun at me.\""]

["00:51,120","00:57,320","\"The little guys in the back.\""]
["00:57,320","00:58,840","\"The little floating flower boys.\""]
["00:58,840","01:11,340","\"Tantor. Tantor from the Tarzan. From the Tarzan book. The Jungle Book. Wait, is Tantor an actual character from Tarzan not the Disney movie? I have no idea. I'm gonna say no. I bet he is.\""]
["01:11,340","01:28,040","\"We're gonna kill the little lightning because we'll wait against him. Miss me? And we have weaknesses. Look at that! I can see why being a kid you would enjoy playing this. It seems very satisfying.\""]
["01:28,040","01:33,040","\"No, it's cool. The story's like really weird, but I like it.\""]
["01:33,040","01:39,040","\"I think this game has one of the better Final Fantasy stories, even though it's really convoluted and dumb.\""]
["01:39,040","01:45,040","\"I mean, that's like Final Fantasy in a nutshell, isn't it? No. But this one probably is the best one out of all of them.\""]
["01:45,040","01:50,040","\"Well, actually, no, but people say six has the best one. I never really got into it, though.\""]
["01:50,040","01:52,040","\"Unpopular opinion.\""]

["02:10,540","02:13,040","\"It's the fucking furnace from Home Alone.\""]
["02:13,040","02:14,340","\"It's-- oh, yeah.\""]
["02:14,340","02:16,740","\"I remember that when he shot at the kid.\""]
["02:16,740","02:18,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:18,240","02:21,340","\"And McCauley Cooker says, \"\"Shah!\"\"\""]
