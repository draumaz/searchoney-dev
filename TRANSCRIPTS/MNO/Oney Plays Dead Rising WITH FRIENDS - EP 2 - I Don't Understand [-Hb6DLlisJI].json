["00:07,800","00:08,800","\"I don't know.\""]
["00:08,800","00:10,300","\"I like that you can jump in the next thing.\""]
["00:10,300","00:11,300","\"I'm gonna die.\""]

["00:17,300","00:19,300","\"Oh, no, inventory spots.\""]

["00:26,300","00:27,300","\"What?\""]
["00:27,300","00:28,300","\"Fucking motion blur.\""]
["00:28,300","00:29,300","\"Why don't you like-\""]
["00:29,300","00:36,940","\"You like motion blur all impact from something that's moving fast does it it makes it look too like slow it makes it look faster I\""]
["00:36,940","00:41,020","\"Think curse your animator what yes\""]
["00:41,020","00:47,620","\"Motion blur happens because things are moving fast. Maybe it's just that there's no I don't know I\""]
["00:47,620","00:51,740","\"You know what looking at this is swing it again hit somebody\""]
["00:51,740","00:57,880","\"Yeah, the the movement itself looks fast. I guess it's just the impact that I don't it's because it pauses when you hit them\""]
["00:57,880","00:59,880","\"Oh, yeah, why does it do that?\""]
["00:59,880","01:00,880","\"Because it always does it.\""]
["01:00,880","01:01,880","\"Why?\""]
["01:01,880","01:03,880","\"Just to make it feel more satisfying, I guess.\""]
["01:03,880","01:04,880","\"Oh.\""]
["01:04,880","01:05,880","\"Because that's what Zelda would do.\""]
["01:05,880","01:07,880","\"But it doesn't look like it's actually hitting them.\""]
["01:07,880","01:09,880","\"Feels like it's hitting them to me.\""]
["01:09,880","01:11,880","\"Is the controller rumbling?\""]
["01:11,880","01:12,880","\"Yes.\""]
["01:12,880","01:13,880","\"Well, that's it.\""]
["01:13,880","01:14,880","\"Oh, yeah!\""]
["01:14,880","01:17,880","\"He looks like a...\""]
["01:17,880","01:18,880","\"What does he look like?\""]

["01:26,880","01:33,240","\"that guy. Reggie Fies, his mouth is all scrunched. Wow, she looks like Ashley from Resilient\""]
["01:33,240","01:39,560","\"before. That's what I was saying. I mentioned that. She really looks like her. Is it her?\""]
["01:39,560","01:45,520","\"They got away. It just looks like her. Might be the same model. It's not. Here's this\""]
["01:45,520","01:50,000","\"old man who never speaks, but you get to kill him later. It's Grodis. Where did he get\""]

["01:56,840","01:58,840","\"That way I was opening the doorway.\""]

["02:01,100","02:04,120","\"- He's gonna push him in.\""]
["02:04,120","02:06,460","\"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, unbelievable.\""]
["02:06,460","02:10,240","\"- She looks just like, are you right?\""]
["02:10,240","02:12,360","\"- Are you a photographer?\""]
["02:12,360","02:14,920","\"- No, I'm a photographer, actually.\""]
["02:14,920","02:16,920","\"- What a graphic.\""]
["02:16,920","02:18,840","\"- Could you show me some pictures, Frank?\""]
["02:18,840","02:21,180","\"- She doubts you.\""]
["02:21,180","02:24,640","\"- Why is Frank so likable?\""]
["02:24,640","02:26,640","\"- 'Cause he looks weird.\""]
["02:26,640","02:27,640","\"I think that's it.\""]
["02:27,640","02:28,640","\"It is a big...\""]
["02:28,640","02:29,640","\"It's his voice too.\""]
["02:29,640","02:30,640","\"He's a very likable voice.\""]
["02:30,640","02:34,640","\"And they didn't get him when they used the things.\""]
["02:34,640","02:35,640","\"I know.\""]
["02:35,640","02:40,720","\"And the guy was like, \"\"Well, we liked him, but we really liked the new direction better.\""]
["02:40,720","02:42,480","\"New Frank sounds funny.\"\"\""]
["02:42,480","02:47,240","\"You know, maybe I'm reacting so badly to the lip sync because it's meant to be in Japanese.\""]
["02:47,240","02:48,240","\"Maybe.\""]
["02:48,240","02:50,040","\"I don't think it is meant to be in Japanese, but it's...\""]
["02:50,040","02:51,440","\"Thanks for showing me though.\""]
["02:51,440","02:55,320","\"It's lip syncing at this point already, who's kind of off in a lot of games.\""]
["02:55,320","02:57,720","\"I don't think Lip Sync was their top priority for this game.\""]
["02:57,720","02:58,360","\"No, it wasn't.\""]
["02:58,360","03:03,000","\"It was to get a game running pretty well with a lot of stuff on screen.\""]
["03:03,000","03:03,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:03,240","03:05,400","\"I see this is totally off.\""]
["03:05,400","03:08,120","\"It looks like she's saying something completely different.\""]
["03:08,120","03:09,160","\"You know what it looks better then?\""]
["03:09,160","03:10,200","\"Me?\""]
["03:10,200","03:11,000","\"And dramada.\""]
["03:11,000","03:14,120","\"The Lip Sync in that game is horrible.\""]
["03:14,120","03:15,880","\"That's because they, they pucker their lips.\""]
["03:15,880","03:17,080","\"Yeah, like, like, pingu.\""]
["03:17,080","03:19,880","\"It's, that's a good comparison.\""]
["03:19,880","03:21,960","\"No, I didn't, I didn't come up with it.\""]
["03:21,960","03:22,840","\"I saw a GIF of it.\""]
["03:24,760","03:25,760","\"It was good though.\""]
["03:25,760","03:27,260","\"Waaah!\""]
["03:27,260","03:28,320","\"I'm going outside of Pla-\""]
["03:28,320","03:31,760","\"I don't mind the actual character animations, it's just a lip syncing.\""]
["03:31,760","03:32,560","\"In this game?\""]
["03:32,560","03:33,060","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:33,060","03:35,060","\"You ain't planning on going out of the mall!\""]
["03:35,060","03:35,560","\"Ooh!\""]
["03:35,560","03:36,060","\"*buzz*\""]
["03:36,060","03:36,560","\"*buzz*\""]
["03:36,560","03:42,060","\"Remember this was a common problem when it came out, because it was so early on, not everyone had an HDT yet.\""]
["03:42,060","03:43,060","\"Yeah, the same, that was me.\""]
["03:43,060","03:45,060","\"Yeah, that was me too, I couldn't read anything.\""]
["03:45,060","03:45,560","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:45,560","03:49,360","\"That's what happened to me when I tried to play Rayman Origins.\""]
["03:49,360","03:49,860","\"Really?\""]
["03:49,860","03:51,360","\"All the text was really tiny.\""]
["03:51,360","03:58,360","\"I remember none of my friends wanted to come over to play Halo because they had HD TVs and I didn't so they didn't want to play on a small one\""]
["03:58,360","04:01,640","\"Oh, why do you want this? Did you say you have an HD TV?\""]
["04:01,640","04:04,880","\"Yeah, yeah, what did you say? That's because\""]
["04:04,880","04:10,160","\"Because I didn't run into that problem till it was like 2011 I think\""]
["04:10,160","04:13,440","\"When the Halo 3 come out 2007\""]
["04:13,440","04:20,960","\"I think it was 2000 wait Halo 3. Yeah, I guess I just think it was seven six or seven. I think it was 2006\""]
["04:20,960","04:29,000","\"Yeah, so like 2007 when I was out that probably just speaks to how behind I am because I never I never I didn't have an HD TV until\""]
["04:29,000","04:34,120","\"I never probably triple a game. So I never run into that problem 2011\""]
["04:34,120","04:36,960","\"Maybe\""]
["04:36,960","04:38,960","\"That's a really good animation\""]
["04:38,960","04:46,260","\"I like kicking the ball - you should just kill her. No the soccer ball adder. No do it\""]
["04:46,960","04:50,580","\"Shit I miss do it in front of her husband you can do that\""]
["04:50,580","04:54,840","\"Drop that on top of her no\""]
["04:54,840","05:01,400","\"You're not gonna kill her nothing on the roof kills them in one hand. How did this lady get on the roof?\""]
["05:01,400","05:03,680","\"How did both of these people get on the roof? Whoa?\""]
["05:03,680","05:08,800","\"Okay, okay, I think dong's playing okay. That's my problem\""]
["05:08,800","05:14,720","\"I think ever everything in this game seems to be animated like it's supposed to be really cartoony. Yeah, it is\""]
["05:14,720","05:19,760","\"They're real people yeah, they're nasty\""]
["05:19,760","05:24,240","\"Great\""]
["05:24,240","05:29,200","\"Also, you could have taken a photo when they hug. Oh, it's a it's a photo app. I\""]
["05:29,200","05:32,340","\"Don't really care about taking photos from this playthrough\""]
["05:32,340","05:38,440","\"Okay, it's one of the most boring parts of the game. This guy's really strong. Are you two doing?\""]
["05:38,440","05:42,600","\"It's all right. We're still\""]
["05:42,600","05:44,600","\"I forgot you can spin.\""]

["06:02,600","06:04,600","\"It's so good.\""]
["06:04,600","06:06,600","\"See that's why this is a good game, Julia.\""]
["06:06,600","06:09,600","\"You can spin on fucking Radiol ladies.\""]

["06:38,680","06:39,680","\"Yeah, they don't know how to pass by.\""]
["06:39,680","06:45,520","\"And if you try to go for a perfect run, everybody gets stuck here fighting each other, and they'll actually kill each other trying to get up.\""]
["06:45,520","06:46,520","\"*laughs*\""]
["06:46,520","06:47,020","\"Come on!\""]
