["01:38,360","01:39,360","\"oh boy\""]
["01:39,360","01:42,360","\"so I can't use my shield against them\""]
["01:42,360","01:44,360","\"so just kind of worrying\""]
["01:44,360","01:46,360","\"I've always felt like there's a weird\""]
["01:46,360","01:48,360","\"mentality around this game\""]
["01:48,360","01:49,360","\"I enjoy it\""]
["01:49,360","01:50,360","\"oh no\""]
["01:50,360","01:51,360","\"a very good amount\""]

["02:01,340","02:10,480","\"Was it a two-fer yeah you little bastard. Oh\""]
["02:10,480","02:15,920","\"Hey, I knew that was gonna happen. I'm glad it didn't kill you what a big two\""]
["02:15,920","02:22,480","\"I'm gonna say there's like a weird mentality around the skin because it's been out for song now that everyone always says\""]
["02:22,480","02:28,060","\"Going to a blind but then if you're new to it and you go into a blind to get really mad at you if you make any mistake\""]
["02:28,060","02:30,060","\"We're gonna know about something\""]
["02:30,060","02:33,580","\"Because I remember I I don't blame people for that. I get it\""]
["02:33,580","02:38,820","\"I remember Julian you were playing Mario 64 for like the first time. Yeah, I fucking sucked at it\""]
["02:38,820","02:42,880","\"Oh, you didn't know where something was and for like a split second\""]
["02:42,880","02:47,700","\"I was thinking in my head like how does he not know that and then I was like oh because he never played it\""]
["02:47,700","02:48,860","\"Of course he doesn't know about it\""]
["02:48,860","02:51,700","\"But that's the thing with a lot of games is that just prior knowledge\""]
["02:51,700","02:55,780","\"It's just frustrating to watch something that you know how to do not be done, right?\""]
["02:55,780","02:59,100","\"Exactly. It's not fair to be to get angry at someone about it\""]
["02:59,100","03:05,600","\"It is why we should all be nice to Chris. Yeah be nice to me. Call me cool\""]
