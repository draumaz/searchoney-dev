["05:03,980","05:09,680","\"You weren't supposed to be here. No coming up here is not necessary. We've figured something else out\""]

["22:06,640","22:11,600","\"You're gonna fill it up before you fill up your video around.\""]
["22:11,600","22:13,520","\"That's honestly amazing.\""]

["23:15,720","23:24,720","\"the beep stop. I kind of wish they didn't. If you could have been a glitch. You just could have gotten so many beeps that it just sounded like a one continuous beep.\""]
["23:24,720","23:31,720","\"Yeah, all the fine waves are canceling each other out. This is so fucking crazy.\""]
["23:31,720","23:37,720","\"Okay. Okay, I believe you.\""]
["23:37,720","23:42,720","\"Oh dude, I finally saw Beetlejuice for I guess the first time.\""]

["24:21,440","24:24,740","\"- Well, no, I mean, yes, but no.\""]
["24:24,740","24:25,580","\"- No, you're not stupid.\""]
["24:25,580","24:27,120","\"- Like, Monica was like, have you ever seen Beetlejuice?\""]
["24:27,120","24:28,880","\"Like, yeah, like a while ago when I was like\""]
["24:28,880","24:32,000","\"a really little kid, but I don't really remember liking it.\""]
["24:32,000","24:34,360","\"And then like, maybe get it so that it's rolling\""]
["24:34,360","24:37,000","\"so it'll roll the original apple off somehow.\""]
["24:37,000","24:39,000","\"Get it yes\""]
["24:39,000","24:46,800","\"Yeah, I just I just Mandela affected a completely different movie into it. That just shot me like 50 miles away\""]

["25:23,960","25:30,900","\"His main argument was that it made no sense that Tarzan was imagining like all the music in his head because he's the only\""]
["25:31,400","25:33,080","\"Is that a fan gonna blow you off?\""]
["25:33,080","25:34,080","\"Oh maybe.\""]
["25:34,080","25:36,080","\"It's the only Disney film.\""]
["25:36,080","25:37,080","\"No, I'm good.\""]

["25:42,400","25:43,920","\"isn't directly singing.\""]
["25:43,920","25:45,160","\"Therefore it's bad!\""]

["26:00,160","26:03,160","\"the exact movie or the exact video you're talking about.\""]
["26:03,160","26:08,160","\"His argument is that like the singing is like not really\""]
