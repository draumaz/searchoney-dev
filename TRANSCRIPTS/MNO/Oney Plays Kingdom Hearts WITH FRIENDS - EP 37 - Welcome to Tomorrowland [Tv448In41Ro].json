["06:35,800","06:40,240","\"But you know I've come to realize and maybe it's not that great\""]
["06:40,240","06:41,720","\"Hmm\""]
["06:41,720","06:46,720","\"Well, I played wild Woody recently and I still think it rocks my socks off\""]
["06:46,720","06:53,960","\"I play it every day and enjoy it very much so and I think it could even possibly be the greatest game ever designed\""]
["06:55,040","07:02,400","\"You're wrong stupid. I'm here to prove to you all you my favorite audience who I love that\""]
["07:02,400","07:06,600","\"I think it is game stinks and this guy's a\""]

["07:15,080","07:22,400","\"Well, let me just say I also appreciate my fans very much my audience is the best audience\""]
["07:23,080","07:31,200","\"Wild Woody is just classic. Pure and simple. You pick up the controller, you press the button,\""]
["07:31,200","07:34,320","\"Woody occasionally jumps. What else do you need?\""]
["07:34,320","07:42,480","\"There's no denying that. I mean, uh, you're wrong because it glitches. It stitches.\""]
["07:42,480","07:48,240","\"Wild Woody looks like a pencil. This would make any sense.\""]
["07:48,240","07:57,200","\"You know you have a point there, but Wild Woody's 3D render was revolutionary for the time and still looks pretty cool. Yeah in Spain\""]

["08:39,460","08:45,480","\"I agree country do need more money\""]
["08:46,440","08:48,440","\"So we're both in agreement\""]
["08:48,440","08:56,320","\"Chris you may have a point about bosses being an outdated concept and how your own to victory when you purchase a video game on\""]
["08:56,320","09:01,640","\"But to do but no, but yeah\""]
["09:01,640","09:07,520","\"Wild Woody's epic. Let's face it. The man is a pencil. He's wild Woody\""]
["09:07,520","09:12,520","\"Know what like a sexual joke gonna give you that would be a negative\""]
["09:12,520","09:16,520","\"if they would cite that as like Wild Woody sounds like a porn movie.\""]

["11:11,220","11:18,340","\"Chris see there they went into the hole he was a black life and it didn't matter that much\""]
["11:25,140","11:28,140","\"That's not what it was called. It's a black lives don't matter\""]
["11:28,140","11:32,720","\"I just realized is goofy considered black or white because he's got white skin on his face\""]
["11:32,720","11:36,900","\"But he's black on every other part. Yeah, we saw him in that hot tub. He's black all over\""]
["11:36,900","11:43,460","\"Would you consider him black? Oh my god? I remember we went to see the goofy movie in a theater recently and\""]

["11:48,340","11:54,340","\"Because you realize that that's why people talk about the movie so much because there's a scene where they stick their toes in the water\""]
["11:54,340","11:59,340","\"There's a lot of emphasis on this thing. There's a lot of emphasis on goofy's big black feet\""]
["11:59,340","12:05,460","\"In a leg over the course of the entire movie. It's disgusting. Has there ever been a black goofy character?\""]
["12:05,460","12:12,580","\"I think power line like supply can't be black. There's been a dog goofy character with like a black face\""]
["12:12,580","12:18,580","\"That's what I'm saying, but power line has like brown where goofy has pink. Really? Yeah, that's true. Okay\""]
["12:18,580","12:24,180","\"So there is black goofy's yeah, I think power line is power line. He's not goofy\""]
["12:24,180","12:26,780","\"He ties goofy up between the power lines.\""]
["12:26,780","12:28,420","\"- I don't even know, like he's not really a reference\""]

["12:30,740","12:32,220","\"- He's supposed to be like Michael Jackson,\""]
["12:32,220","12:33,340","\"but not really.\""]
["12:33,340","12:35,100","\"- Not really in terms of how he looks,\""]
["12:35,100","12:38,260","\"but voice sounds like Michael Jackson, I guess.\""]
