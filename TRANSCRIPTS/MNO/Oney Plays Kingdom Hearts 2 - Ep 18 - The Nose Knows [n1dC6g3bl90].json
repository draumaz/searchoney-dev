["00:21,840","00:24,040","\"Didn't look as good as the movie.\""]
["00:24,040","00:27,540","\"It's like it was a real coin in the movie.\""]
["00:27,540","00:34,100","\"We're supposed to add music you fucking idiots. This is the part where goes down. Where's the music?\""]
["00:34,100","00:37,580","\"Do you hear it? I don't\""]
["00:37,580","00:41,820","\"This does not convey the same message of the movie\""]

["01:50,980","01:52,980","\"It's a swashbuckle in the ventur.\""]
["01:52,980","01:54,980","\"You don't even swash nothing though.\""]
["01:54,980","01:57,980","\"What does swashbuckling mean?\""]
["01:57,980","02:00,980","\"It's when you take your sword out of your buckle and it goes swash!\""]

["12:58,460","13:01,060","\"I gotta go back and return the treasure\""]
["13:01,060","13:03,740","\"And then he's gone for the rest of the game\""]
["13:03,740","13:08,060","\"Well, how would the rules for that work because that goes into a different world would he still turn into it?\""]
["13:08,060","13:09,360","\"Yeah, it's a good question\""]
["13:09,360","13:12,780","\"But he would be styled in the same way of that world, but now he's a zombie\""]
["13:12,780","13:18,780","\"Well, see now you're making it really confusing because you're mixing styles from other worlds into other worlds\""]
["13:18,780","13:23,940","\"Yeah, but then you go back to this world after Goopy does you find him dead with a sword in his head\""]
["13:23,940","13:29,540","\"But then old-timey Sora is there for some reason, but it's also not you?\""]
["13:29,540","13:33,620","\"Yeah. Yeah, that's not my fault Kingdom Hearts established that rule.\""]
["13:33,620","13:38,180","\"And Roxas and Nightmare before Christmas Roxas are there.\""]
["13:38,180","13:40,420","\"Yeah. So they're hands and they fuse into one.\""]
["13:40,420","13:43,700","\"That would look so stupid.\""]
["13:43,700","13:46,580","\"Two nobodies can actually become a sombody.\""]
["13:46,580","13:47,220","\"Oh my god.\""]

["14:18,980","14:20,980","\"Why did they throw bread to begin with?\""]
["14:21,460","14:23,460","\"Cuz he said\""]
["14:23,460","14:28,140","\"So he said that preemptively\""]
["14:28,140","14:34,020","\"Stop throwing bread and then they brought bread to the next show like what?\""]
["14:34,020","14:41,520","\"Now it's the bread thing stuck up with alleyways of bread does he have a gluten\""]
["14:41,520","14:46,340","\"Allergy that he needs to avoid it like why it's just funny cuz it's something you do for a doc\""]
["14:46,340","14:50,280","\"It's because it just have to show somebody randomly through bread and he said stop throwing bread\""]
["14:50,280","14:56,800","\"And then they kept throwing bread you can even get that. Oh, yeah, I don't know why you walked up that\""]
["14:56,800","14:59,360","\"It was too powerful\""]
["14:59,360","15:04,240","\"Don't throw bread up here now and they do it\""]
["15:04,240","15:09,120","\"It's great because it just keeps playing it on loop in the bag. I\""]
["15:09,120","15:12,360","\"Kind of miss when\""]

["15:23,200","15:26,120","\"and one of them\""]
["15:26,120","15:29,560","\"Would do it what they would do in the Hall of the Mountain King\""]
["15:29,560","15:36,960","\"It would say like this is what I'm saying if I read that's cool, and then it would just cut off wherever that's fun\""]
["15:36,960","15:42,240","\"Goobler\""]
["15:42,720","15:47,880","\"Like you guys but go blurs my favorite bring him up here and kill him\""]

["16:43,660","16:49,020","\"I remember when the scene in the movie held down at that long.\""]
["16:49,020","16:51,860","\"Show yourself, Pete! The tide has changed!\""]
["16:51,860","16:54,580","\"I kind of wish the movie had awkward timing like this.\""]

["16:56,420","16:57,220","\"I told you! I told you!\""]
["16:57,220","16:59,060","\"I was here day-hoi-dive!\""]

["17:51,260","17:53,260","\"Wait, you can only use magic on children.\""]
["17:53,260","17:55,260","\"That's a rule.\""]
["17:55,260","17:57,260","\"You can burn them, electrocute them.\""]
["17:57,260","17:58,260","\"And blunt objects.\""]
["17:58,260","17:59,260","\"That too.\""]
["17:59,260","18:01,260","\"That's acceptable.\""]
