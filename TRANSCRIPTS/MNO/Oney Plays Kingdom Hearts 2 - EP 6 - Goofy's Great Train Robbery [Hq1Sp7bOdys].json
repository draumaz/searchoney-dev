["05:30,960","05:34,720","\"him in the past in general. Like people would be like, \"\"Oh, he's the worst care.\"\" It seems\""]
["05:34,720","05:41,560","\"like just indifference. Mm-hmm. But I'm really glad that we played through the\""]

["06:02,560","06:07,240","\"really I think it's different than a soap opera let's talk about this we\""]
["06:07,240","06:13,080","\"watch the Super Mario movie last night. I could go back to that movie over and over again.\""]
["06:13,080","06:18,600","\"I really, really, really like it. It's not actually good, but it's so stupid that it's\""]
["06:18,600","06:22,200","\"entertaining every single time. Yeah, I know. I love that movie. I grew up with that movie.\""]
["06:22,200","06:26,520","\"But I think it's stuff like that when I think of like Kingdom Hearts that's just\""]

["06:35,160","06:36,760","\"And I think that's fun.\""]
["06:36,760","06:50,260","\"You know, I haven't researched it, but I had the general, like, impression that it was one of those cases where they wanted to do something interesting with it and the studio kept fucking it up for them.\""]
["06:50,260","06:55,760","\"I haven't researched that. I don't know how true that is, but that's what I've been told before.\""]
["06:55,760","06:57,560","\"Why are they in melting chambers?\""]
["06:57,560","06:59,060","\"Because they're gonna get melted.\""]

["07:24,640","07:28,160","\"I just thought that was fucking funny how I did that\""]
["07:28,160","07:32,100","\"I never watched because I was too afraid that my mom and dad were walking and then in the future\""]
["07:32,100","07:36,500","\"You guys showed it to me. What did you think about it? What did you finally have to see it? I love that.\""]
["07:36,500","07:40,060","\"It is a fun movie, isn't it? It's the funniest movie.\""]
["07:40,060","07:47,940","\"That's pretty consistently entertaining like the whole way through. Yeah, there's always something happening.\""]

["08:09,400","08:16,300","\"He rides in on a giant invisible chameleons\""]
["08:16,300","08:25,940","\"Really good example of like I'm having to insert crazy action shit where there wasn't room for it in the original\""]
["08:25,940","08:27,540","\"That's a really good point, yeah.\""]
["08:27,540","08:31,460","\"You should just fight Clayton by himself and he dies in one hand.\""]
