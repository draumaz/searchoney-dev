["03:43,640","03:47,240","\"played to before I knew anything about one\""]
["03:47,240","03:51,080","\"so I didn't know these guys were aliens\""]
["03:51,080","03:54,480","\"well this one's not obviously well yeah\""]
["03:54,480","03:58,120","\"He's not no, I didn't know either. I just assumed they were people yeah\""]
["03:58,120","04:04,340","\"I thought they were just like a stand-in for Nazis as per usual has there ever been a part where you see them without the suits?\""]
["04:04,340","04:07,360","\"I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think so either\""]
["04:07,360","04:15,240","\"That would be kind of cool. Maybe they're just robots that the aliens control. No, they're silly. They're silly little guys\""]
["04:15,240","04:20,880","\"Tomer that's gonna be you someday a little splatter of blood on the ground\""]
["04:20,880","04:23,880","\"All these aliens just happen to speak English\""]
["04:23,880","04:30,560","\"It's a good video game\""]
["04:30,560","04:39,000","\"So this is one of the things that really bothers me about this game\""]
["04:39,000","04:43,820","\"And I'm gonna try to keep the negativity to a minimum because I actually fucking hate this game\""]
["04:43,820","04:46,400","\"Maybe I'll re-experience it. Maybe I'll change my mind on it\""]
["04:46,400","04:47,840","\"I'm trying to keep an open mind.\""]
["04:47,840","04:55,000","\"The fact that Barney talks to Gordon Freeman like they are like old college drinking buddies and Gordon Freeman used to be the fucking life of the party.\""]
["04:55,000","05:00,500","\"He insinuates that Gordon Freeman has a personality and either he's like talking and you don't hear him.\""]
["05:00,500","05:03,900","\"Or like it's just weird. It's just weird.\""]
["05:03,900","05:04,800","\"It is weird.\""]
["05:04,800","05:08,400","\"Because all he does is just stare at people silently and murder guys with crowbars.\""]
["05:08,400","05:12,600","\"But everyone's like, \"\"Gordon, my best friend. I have such a close personal attachment to you.\"\"\""]
["05:12,600","05:14,200","\"It's like, but why?\""]
["05:14,200","05:17,280","\"I'm like a non-vocal sociopass,\""]
["05:17,280","05:19,600","\"'cause we're Hollywood elite Peter files, don't you see?\""]
["05:19,600","05:22,440","\"- So just the fact that you keep silent about the Peter.\""]
["05:22,440","05:24,760","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:24,760","05:26,760","\"- That's all it takes for these people to like you.\""]
["05:26,760","05:27,840","\"- Yes.\""]
["05:27,840","05:29,920","\"- That's why they like him, 'cause he doesn't talk.\""]
["05:29,920","05:30,760","\"- Okay.\""]
["05:30,760","05:32,160","\"- I have no questions.\""]
["05:32,160","05:33,800","\"- I'll meet up with you later.\""]
["05:33,800","05:34,640","\"- Okay.\""]
["05:34,640","05:37,600","\"So Tomar, this is why this game is good.\""]
["05:37,600","05:40,200","\"Get a box, put it there.\""]
["05:40,200","05:41,040","\"Go up the leg.\""]
["05:41,040","05:43,040","\"You've done it. Oh\""]
["05:43,040","05:45,480","\"Yeah, this is what it's for sorry\""]
["05:45,480","05:48,620","\"No, it's a while. I agree. I don't think this game is perfect\""]
["05:48,620","05:52,500","\"But I do think it is mostly good. I do like to fit like I like G-mod a lot\""]
["05:52,500","05:57,600","\"I like fucking around with the engine. I just don't think the game is like anything all that special\""]
["05:57,600","05:59,840","\"Have you ever seen a game do that before?\""]
["05:59,840","06:06,220","\"Break bottles pretty late. You see sure and this came out in 1994. So that's pretty cool\""]
["06:06,220","06:08,620","\"- It did not. - Yeah, maybe that's a little bit\""]
["06:08,620","06:09,620","\"of the problem is I played it.\""]
["06:09,620","06:11,100","\"- It came out in like 2004.\""]
["06:11,100","06:13,020","\"- I played it much later.\""]
["06:13,020","06:14,140","\"- Oh really? - So I played it, yeah.\""]
["06:14,140","06:16,700","\"I played it maybe, whenever the orange box came out\""]
["06:16,700","06:19,660","\"on the Xbox, that was the first time I played it.\""]
["06:19,660","06:22,060","\"This came out around a time when people,\""]
["06:22,060","06:24,600","\"like, you know, they're intertwining these little cut scenes\""]
["06:24,600","06:26,620","\"with the gameplay, so it's like immersing you\""]
["06:26,620","06:27,760","\"with the world a little more.\""]
["06:27,760","06:30,060","\"So at the time people were like, this is a new cool thing.\""]
["06:30,060","06:32,780","\"- Yeah, I had played like a zillion billion games\""]
["06:32,780","06:35,100","\"that had done that by the time this came out.\""]
["06:35,100","06:39,220","\"Like I'd already played BioShock before I played a Half-Life 2.\""]
["06:39,220","06:40,060","\"- Oh. - So that--\""]
["06:40,060","06:41,220","\"- BioShock came later though.\""]
["06:41,220","06:45,220","\"- Yeah, yeah, and BioShock obviously takes a lot of ideas\""]
["06:45,220","06:47,060","\"from Half-Life. - Yeah.\""]
["06:47,060","06:50,060","\"(upbeat music)\""]
["06:50,060","06:50,900","\"- Oh!\""]
["06:50,900","06:53,900","\"I'm sorry, he's pissed! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\""]
["06:53,900","06:55,460","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:55,460","06:56,820","\"- I'm fucking kidding.\""]
["06:56,820","06:58,060","\"- That's the rule though.\""]
["06:58,060","07:02,220","\"You're allowed to take two swings at a lawbreaker\""]
["07:02,220","07:03,620","\"and then you have to stand down.\""]
["07:03,620","07:06,100","\"We were going to go on a dole.\""]
["07:06,100","07:07,580","\"It looks like he's going to beat that dude.\""]
["07:07,580","07:09,380","\"I don't think this is supposed to happen.\""]
["07:09,380","07:11,780","\"I'm just like, this is a mistake.\""]
["07:11,780","07:13,020","\"Is he stuck behind that guy?\""]
["07:13,020","07:14,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:14,580","07:15,740","\"Can I make him hit him?\""]
["07:15,740","07:17,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:17,740","07:21,420","\"This is a weird little thing.\""]
["07:21,420","07:24,540","\"Throw some Chinese food out of make him swing.\""]
["07:24,540","07:25,380","\"Oh fuck.\""]
["07:25,380","07:26,620","\"Oh damn it.\""]
["07:26,620","07:28,100","\"Fuck.\""]
["07:28,100","07:30,740","\"I thought I was going to cheat the system.\""]
["07:30,740","07:31,580","\"Is your own old?\""]
["07:31,580","07:33,000","\"out of that garbage.\""]
["07:33,000","07:36,780","\"- Good.\""]
["07:36,780","07:41,780","\"- Let's stalk this woman.\""]
["07:41,780","07:46,660","\"You're playing cameraman for your machinima.\""]
["07:46,660","07:47,860","\"Oh yeah, this is a machinima.\""]
["07:47,860","07:50,940","\"It's like, what's a normal day for this woman\""]
["07:50,940","07:52,260","\"walking down this street?\""]
["07:52,260","07:54,540","\"- What's she holding like a bucket of popcorn?\""]
["07:54,540","07:58,460","\"- Dude, circle like 2000, 2010.\""]
["07:58,460","08:01,100","\"There were some real pretentious ones out there.\""]
["08:01,100","08:03,580","\"- I remember I saw one where it was like,\""]
["08:03,580","08:08,480","\"it was like an homage to 2001, a space odyssey,\""]
["08:08,480","08:11,500","\"and it was made in Halo 1 in a year when,\""]
["08:11,500","08:13,540","\"it was like after Halo Reach was out,\""]
["08:13,540","08:15,700","\"it was like trying to be really intense,\""]
["08:15,700","08:17,620","\"and atmospheric, and it just sucked.\""]
["08:17,620","08:21,180","\"But the guy was like super pretentious too.\""]
["08:21,180","08:24,100","\"- Comedy machinima is low art.\""]
["08:24,100","08:27,740","\"- This homage to something that is generally accepted\""]
["08:27,740","08:30,660","\"as smart will therefore be smart.\""]
["08:30,660","08:33,900","\"Yes, I love how creepy everyone in this game looks.\""]
["08:33,900","08:34,900","\"Mmm.\""]
["08:34,900","08:36,820","\"Everyone just looks like a weird Russian dude.\""]
["08:36,820","08:37,660","\"I worried.\""]
["08:37,660","08:40,180","\"But they look pretty good for 2004.\""]
["08:40,180","08:42,580","\"They still look pretty OK.\""]
["08:42,580","08:44,540","\"It's OK.\""]
["08:44,540","08:47,180","\"It's way better than like a PS2 face.\""]
["08:47,180","08:49,340","\"Spin your little blocks, guys.\""]
["08:49,340","08:50,540","\"Come on.\""]
["08:50,540","08:53,460","\"Why aren't you spinning?\""]
["08:53,460","08:56,060","\"You better fucking win.\""]
["08:56,060","08:57,860","\"This is awesome, dude.\""]
["08:57,860","08:59,860","\"What are you X's or O's make up your mind?\""]
["08:59,860","09:04,060","\"Get away from me and playing did you ever play with one of those on the playground?\""]
["09:04,060","09:06,500","\"I've never seen one of these as a tic-tac-toe\""]
["09:06,500","09:13,900","\"It's like the most half-assed thing you can stick in a playground just like a machine that automates the very arduous process of tic-tac-toe\""]
["09:13,900","09:18,340","\"Go go go go\""]
["09:18,340","09:22,780","\"See this is a fucking great game. If only that we're china jump on that and launch yourself\""]
["09:23,780","09:27,960","\"Whoa, I was gonna say Gordon's not allowed to get this close to a playground. I thought\""]
["09:27,960","09:31,380","\"This is all he can do\""]
["09:31,380","09:34,860","\"This is why\""]
["09:34,860","09:37,100","\"You know what that's a good backstory\""]
["09:37,100","09:41,080","\"They're like you're not allowed to go within 50 feet of a playground because this is what he does\""]
["09:41,080","09:46,020","\"He hurts himself and then he's on the register because of that but everyone thinks he gets put on the\""]
["09:46,020","09:48,260","\"He gets put on the boo boo register\""]
["09:52,180","09:54,260","\"- I've never actually looked up here before.\""]
["09:54,260","09:56,540","\"- There's gotta be something really important of here.\""]
["09:56,540","09:57,460","\"- The door.\""]
["09:57,460","10:01,060","\"What is this alien thing?\""]
["10:01,060","10:04,500","\"- Is it supposed to be like a retina scanner?\""]
["10:04,500","10:05,660","\"- That's a wiener scanner.\""]
["10:05,660","10:07,540","\"- Yeah, but they're dicks in it and it's like,\""]
["10:07,540","10:08,540","\"if we recognize--\""]
["10:08,540","10:10,220","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:10,220","10:12,180","\"- It's foreskin biometrics.\""]
["10:12,180","10:13,220","\"- Yes.\""]
["10:13,220","10:14,980","\"- To go to circle back to that.\""]
["10:14,980","10:16,980","\"- Every foreskin is like a snowflake.\""]
["10:16,980","10:18,620","\"None of them are the same.\""]
["10:18,620","10:20,860","\"- So all the resistance fighters are circumcised\""]
["10:20,860","10:22,700","\"so they can't have their four skins red.\""]
["10:22,700","10:23,700","\"- Exactly.\""]
["10:23,700","10:27,220","\"- Like sanding off your finger.\""]
["10:27,220","10:29,380","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:29,380","10:31,420","\"Apparently that doesn't even fucking work.\""]
["10:31,420","10:32,780","\"No, you can't lose your fingerprints.\""]
["10:32,780","10:33,620","\"- No.\""]
["10:33,620","10:35,300","\"- I thought you can burn them off with acid.\""]
["10:35,300","10:36,500","\"- No, they grew back.\""]
["10:36,500","10:39,100","\"- Well, they do grow back, but they'll stay off for a bit.\""]
["10:39,100","10:40,500","\"- For like a minute.\""]

["12:25,620","12:28,460","\"- I find the sound in this game to be really, really weird.\""]
["12:28,460","12:30,740","\"Like, this is supposed to be like an intense like--\""]
["12:30,740","12:32,180","\"- Yeah, there's no music.\""]
["12:32,180","12:33,180","\"- Yeah. - I mean,\""]

["12:37,260","12:39,460","\"well, even just now, it didn't occur to me\""]
["12:39,460","12:41,100","\"that this was like a chase.\""]
["12:41,100","12:43,180","\"I was like, oh, oh yeah.\""]
["12:43,180","12:45,300","\"I saw the Combine guy come up the stairs\""]

["12:49,860","12:51,060","\"I\""]
["12:51,060","12:56,660","\"Think it gets you more in the world wonders like not music and shit kind of spoon-feeding you what's going on\""]
["12:56,660","12:58,660","\"I mean Tomar said the music thing I was\""]
["12:58,660","13:03,060","\"I think that it's still a cinematic work music couldn't have hurt\""]
["13:03,060","13:08,500","\"Well, even even just the idea that like you hear them like kicking in the door like they're shooting at you right now\""]
["13:08,500","13:11,860","\"And it's like hard to hear them shooting at you. No, that's true\""]
["13:12,900","13:18,020","\"Like I'm not I'm not getting vibes like oh fuck. Oh fuck. I'm just kind of like oh yeah\""]
["13:18,020","13:20,620","\"That's like kind of there outside the window somewhere\""]
["13:20,620","13:27,060","\"You know what it's gonna be okay. Well, I know barricade the windows and stay in here for the rest of the game\""]
["13:27,060","13:29,060","\"I'm trying to there we go\""]
["13:29,060","13:31,700","\"They'll never get in\""]
["13:31,700","13:38,820","\"I was kind of exaggerating earlier when I hate this game. It's more than I kind of don't I don't get it\""]
["13:39,140","13:42,900","\"Like I think I think it's okay like I beat it. I played through it\""]
["13:42,900","13:48,660","\"I didn't put it down, but like I don't see what's so great about it\""]
["13:48,660","13:53,460","\"I think it's just the atmosphere really it's got a pretty good atmosphere for a lot of it\""]
["13:53,460","13:56,980","\"It's got a pretty cool woman. She smiles\""]
["13:56,980","14:01,420","\"This was all cutting edge in 2004 really was\""]

["14:35,780","14:37,380","\"Is it in Vice City when you beat the game?\""]
["14:37,380","14:37,880","\"No.\""]
["14:37,880","14:44,080","\"Now I have to consider whether or not I ever actually beat Vice City.\""]
