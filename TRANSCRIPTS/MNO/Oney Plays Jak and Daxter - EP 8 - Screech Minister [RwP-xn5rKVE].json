["00:05,480","00:10,860","\"I don't like it when video games break my immersion by spring feces on the screen.\""]
["00:10,860","00:12,860","\"I hate the more speckles on the screen.\""]
["00:12,860","00:14,700","\"There's fart specks at the lower corner.\""]
["00:14,700","00:19,120","\"Remember when every game would have a big ahead mode that was like a common sheet for some reason?\""]
["00:19,120","00:21,120","\"Yeah, and paintball gun mode.\""]
["00:21,120","00:23,040","\"Very strange.\""]
["00:23,040","00:31,340","\"Zach, if there was a game where one of the many games is you shitting a toilet and the corners of the screen got like flicked with like poo, would you laugh?\""]
["00:31,340","00:36,280","\"I would I would really want to see some guy on YouTube review that get really mad about that\""]
["00:36,280","00:41,540","\"That's what I like this game a lot until I saw the poop part. Do you think this is funny?\""]
["00:41,540","00:44,100","\"I would think that would be funny. I think it'd be hilarious\""]
["00:44,100","00:48,460","\"I've never seen a game parody the blood splats around the corner of the screen when you get shot\""]
["00:48,460","00:50,460","\"So I want to see\""]
["00:50,460","00:52,460","\"Fuck\""]
["00:52,460","00:54,740","\"Let's if you just shout out a cat\""]
["00:54,740","00:59,180","\"Let me organize or just jumped out from behind the TV. I never even allow you key\""]
["00:59,180","01:04,180","\"Oh, uh, Lyle.\""]
["01:04,180","01:05,180","\"Yeah, what up?\""]
["01:05,180","01:09,180","\"I have you started to realize how shitty this piece of shit is yet.\""]
["01:09,180","01:10,180","\"I like it!\""]
["01:10,180","01:12,180","\"I'm kidding, this is a fun game.\""]
["01:12,180","01:17,180","\"I kind of miss this basic platformer's where it's this kind of mindless go-get shit.\""]
["01:17,180","01:22,180","\"Yeah, I was actually a little bit worried that this game would just be like terrible,\""]
["01:22,180","01:25,180","\"and I would just be like, \"\"Ah man, this isn't as good as I remember it.\"\"\""]
["01:25,180","01:28,180","\"Does anybody know the reason why these kind of- the style of game fell out?\""]
["01:28,180","01:30,740","\"- I'll push that. - 'Cause other games were more popular.\""]
["01:30,740","01:31,900","\"It's not 'cause these were bad.\""]
["01:31,900","01:35,540","\"- They're also like, I would assume, like hard to make.\""]
["01:35,540","01:37,340","\"Like you actually have to think about the design\""]
["01:37,340","01:39,540","\"where if you fucking make like a Call of Duty game,\""]
["01:39,540","01:41,860","\"you just have to have a room and throw a bunch of dudes in it.\""]
["01:41,860","01:43,380","\"Be like, \"\"There you go, it's a room.\"\"\""]
["01:43,380","01:45,100","\"- Wow, Lyle, that's very misinformed.\""]
["01:45,100","01:45,940","\"- Probably.\""]
["01:45,940","01:47,980","\"- That's probably reductive to a fault,\""]
["01:47,980","01:50,380","\"but I would assume that a lot more design goes\""]
["01:50,380","01:52,900","\"into like a platformer like this.\""]
["01:52,900","01:55,540","\"- I will say people do like shooting on Call of Duty\""]
["01:55,540","01:57,700","\"for like it's art and stuff,\""]
["01:57,700","02:00,880","\"but there's some good art in there\""]
["02:00,880","02:02,820","\"i mean i i liked him for a while\""]
["02:02,820","02:06,380","\"the the infinity ward ones the old infinity ward ones are good\""]
["02:06,380","02:08,040","\"i'm not talking about the uh...\""]
["02:08,040","02:12,500","\"generic military aesthetic i mean the actual like shots they do in the\""]
["02:12,500","02:15,300","\"the set pieces and stuff sometimes they look cool\""]
["02:15,300","02:17,740","\"not very fun to play though\""]
["02:17,740","02:21,340","\"i was just making sure the window was uh... closed so that\""]
["02:21,340","02:23,500","\"if there was a call of duty fan\""]
["02:23,500","02:26,100","\"Yeah, a little laser being traced on the back of your head.\""]
["02:26,100","02:28,780","\"You shined the back of that neck with a fucking bolt action rifle?\""]
["02:28,780","02:29,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:29,780","02:37,780","\"I think Call of Duty 2, Modern Warfare 2, is the greatest video I've ever slotted.\""]
["02:37,780","02:40,820","\"I've never slotted a more greater video.\""]
["02:40,820","02:45,220","\"The slot on my PS2 has worn away from me putting that one in.\""]
["02:45,220","02:49,300","\"My mom keeps yelling at me because the slot on my PS2 gets more worn out every day.\""]
["02:49,300","02:50,260","\"Wait, what the fuck?\""]
["02:50,500","02:53,800","\"I'm like, oh, I'm just... just shooting rats?\""]
["02:53,800","03:00,100","\"What do you think of the fact that there's games out there that are so unbelievably bad\""]
["03:00,100","03:03,700","\"that are worth $25,000 just because there's only one copy of them?\""]
["03:03,700","03:06,500","\"Like what? You mean like that scam sheet of hell game?\""]
["03:06,500","03:07,500","\"Like that kind of shit.\""]
["03:07,500","03:09,900","\"Do you remember the Kickstarter video they did where they like...\""]
["03:09,900","03:11,700","\"Didn't they brag about scamming about your people?\""]
["03:11,700","03:14,100","\"I don't want to speak ill of them, but that's what I recall.\""]
["03:14,100","03:17,300","\"People put fake-ass value on these awful pieces of shit\""]
["03:17,300","03:20,300","\"just 'cause they're kind of ingrained in video game history.\""]
["03:20,300","03:24,720","\"Yeah, well what happens a lot of those one of those really old games like if you're if there's 70s or 80s or something\""]
["03:24,720","03:26,780","\"Yeah, it's a piece of s game\""]
["03:26,780","03:32,620","\"It's just funny that right now we could probably make something that's a fucking horrendous piece of shit\""]
["03:32,620","03:37,300","\"We could probably get some hype around it and then we could scam people with it, right?\""]
["03:37,300","03:39,180","\"Yeah, we could say this game's gonna be awesome\""]
["03:39,180","03:43,900","\"But then in the future if we only make a few copies of it now in the future will be worth like a 30 years\""]
["03:43,900","03:47,100","\"Yeah, yeah, let's do that. What's the game called?\""]
["03:49,020","03:52,500","\"Okay, okay, you think of one word you think of the next world to get a last word for the game\""]

["03:57,140","04:01,660","\"Doggo screech lightning dog. Oh the best the best Effie game of all time\""]
["04:01,660","04:07,800","\"They should make a game called screech minister and you're you're just a screaming freeze\""]
["04:07,800","04:10,820","\"I still want to play a game called worm Odyssey really badly\""]
["04:10,820","04:13,460","\"Well, we just do that one\""]

["04:33,160","04:35,340","\"preferably in hashtag form\""]
["04:35,340","04:37,380","\"how much are we raising for war modesty what are we asking?\""]
["04:37,380","04:38,660","\"I think we need a hundred thousand for that\""]

["05:06,420","05:08,420","\"So we're just selling a pet worm at this point.\""]
["05:08,420","05:12,420","\"That's the executive producer fee you get if you donate $15,000.\""]
["05:12,420","05:18,480","\"If you donate $20,000, we will create tiny little googly eyes to weld onto the worm's\""]

["05:19,480","05:33,380","\"Welding not $70,000, you can voice one of the worm enemies, which sounds like this.\""]
["05:33,380","05:38,940","\"If you donate the full million, you are executive producer at the bottom of the credits.\""]
["05:38,940","05:42,580","\"And also you are responsible for making the whole entire game\""]
["05:42,580","05:48,940","\"At the very end the war says hi, thanks. He says your name. Yeah, Steven. Thanks, Steven\""]
["05:48,940","05:52,660","\"That's awful and then\""]

["06:44,860","06:46,380","\"What was that you?\""]
["06:46,380","06:50,380","\"Maybe oh we were looking at the trailer and it looked like it was a game where you are\""]
["06:50,380","06:55,560","\"Caesar with an AK-47 and you shoot other monkeys with it, and I thought that would have been absolutely\""]
["06:55,560","07:01,060","\"I would love that as a game that would be a funny first person shooter. You're shooting other apes\""]
["07:02,060","07:06,740","\"But it just turns out it was a like a telltale story game. I was like fuck\""]
["07:06,740","07:09,960","\"I would love if you were in little monkey with a gun and you could kill their apes\""]
["07:09,960","07:15,140","\"Yeah, like you can blow off through arms and shit be fucking brilliant. It's like the GT with monkeys basically\""]

["07:39,580","07:40,580","\"Okay, here's a question.\""]
["07:40,580","07:44,580","\"Do you think if like the biggest mass shooting,\""]
["07:44,580","07:46,580","\"this is like not even that funny, but just,\""]
["07:46,580","07:47,580","\"no, it's not a hypothetical.\""]
["07:47,580","07:48,580","\"This is funny.\""]
["07:48,580","07:50,580","\"The biggest mass shooting ever happened ever.\""]
["07:50,580","07:54,580","\"It was like fucking 90 people die, but they go up and they look at\""]
["07:54,580","07:55,580","\"the room where the shooter was from.\""]
["07:55,580","07:58,580","\"And it's a it's a it's a goblin.\""]
["07:58,580","08:03,720","\"Do you think you would you go up under the shooting would you be more interested in the fact that it was a goblin or was the biggest mass shooting?\""]
["08:03,720","08:06,360","\"Would you be more a goblin for sure quite frankly the\""]
["08:06,360","08:12,420","\"Happens like every day. Yeah a goblin doesn't happen every day. I'd be shocked by that\""]
["08:12,420","08:16,900","\"I don't know what I would do if a goblin did the worst whatever a\""]
["08:16,900","08:23,480","\"Goblin would do a mass clubbing it wouldn't be a shooting you're right. It'd be a big fucking be a shanking\""]
