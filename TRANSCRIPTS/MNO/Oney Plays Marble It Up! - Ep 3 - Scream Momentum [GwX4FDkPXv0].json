["00:21,840","00:23,240","\"Ooh, that's a good idea.\""]

["00:27,600","00:29,440","\"This week's lesson,\""]
["00:29,440","00:33,540","\"Don't put your hand in fire. It's hot. It hurts. Yeah, you really do that now\""]

["01:02,580","01:08,860","\"There's in Mario land. Yeah, but there's the boxes and they're just spray painting. What are those are robots tumbling around?\""]

["01:40,940","01:47,960","\"You'll use lots of packing when you're packing like yeah\""]
["01:47,960","01:48,800","\"- Yeah, your pet's true.\""]
["01:48,800","01:51,480","\"- Put lots of soft things.\""]
["01:51,480","01:54,280","\"- Do lots of packing when you're packing.\""]
["01:54,280","01:57,120","\"(laughing)\""]
["01:57,120","01:57,960","\"- That's good advice.\""]
["01:57,960","01:59,080","\"- You creep.\""]
["01:59,080","02:01,400","\"- When you move out, remember to pack.\""]
["02:01,400","02:02,600","\"You don't want to forget that.\""]
["02:02,600","02:03,440","\"- Yeah, that's valuable.\""]
["02:03,440","02:05,320","\"- Oh, God damn it!\""]
["02:05,320","02:09,920","\"Don't let the platform get away.\""]

["02:14,320","02:15,160","\"- Okay.\""]
["02:15,160","02:16,160","\"- On the marble.\""]
["02:17,520","02:19,520","\"Okay, that was good.\""]
["02:19,520","02:21,760","\"Can you make it past the angry blocks?\""]
["02:21,760","02:22,600","\"- I don't think so.\""]
["02:22,600","02:24,160","\"- See, you know what?\""]
["02:24,160","02:25,320","\"This game is perfect for me.\""]
["02:25,320","02:26,440","\"I love just momentum.\""]
["02:26,440","02:27,960","\"That's all I like in video games.\""]
["02:27,960","02:29,280","\"- Do you like angry blocks?\""]
["02:29,280","02:30,680","\"- Momentum feels really good.\""]
["02:30,680","02:33,680","\"I'm trying to get, I keep trying to get Dingedong to play\""]
["02:33,680","02:34,640","\"Ray-Man Arena with me,\""]
["02:34,640","02:37,760","\"'cause it was one of the few games I had growing up.\""]
["02:37,760","02:40,200","\"- That's all like, there are a lovely sense of momentum\""]
["02:40,200","02:41,440","\"in that one. - I don't play video games.\""]
["02:41,440","02:43,200","\"I just want to work.\""]
["02:43,200","02:44,400","\"- I'm in video games.\""]
["02:44,400","02:46,400","\"- Yeah, but I don't want to play 'em.\""]
["02:46,400","02:51,800","\"I'm kind of done like playing new shit when I'm playing the stuff. I'm always just thinking to myself about my own ideas\""]
["02:51,800","02:55,540","\"Well, yeah, that's the that's why it's fun to play new things because you can be all like oh\""]
["02:55,540","02:57,720","\"I don't like this, but I like this you get ideas from it\""]
["02:57,720","03:00,560","\"Yeah, but then I also feel bad because I'm not being productive\""]
["03:00,560","03:05,800","\"So only play video games a little bit which you probably do just fine I\""]
["03:05,800","03:11,640","\"Don't know the only time I see you playing video games is when you're streaming. Oh pretty much\""]
["03:11,640","03:14,720","\"I don't know. I don't think I play them too often\""]
["03:15,120","03:21,440","\"Fuck dude, this is scary momentum Chris. Oh my god. Just scream momentum. Oh\""]
["03:21,440","03:25,680","\"Dude fuck yeah\""]
["03:25,680","03:29,680","\"What spooky scary Halloween music like I was kicking ass there already in\""]
["03:29,680","03:33,860","\"I like this song. I like this music is very good. I\""]
["03:33,860","03:39,720","\"Mean I don't need momentum to have fun in the game like crash - has no momentum. Yeah, it doesn't but it's tight\""]
["03:39,720","03:42,440","\"And I like it it's cuz it's really fast - yeah\""]
["03:42,440","03:47,400","\"It's really responsive you have a lot of movement options. I really do think crash 2 is my favorite game of all time. I really\""]
["03:47,400","03:50,680","\"What is your second favorite?\""]
["03:50,680","03:54,360","\"Probably Dark Souls 1\""]
["03:54,360","03:57,320","\"These seem good like good picks\""]
["03:57,320","04:01,120","\"But Dark Souls 1 is like really really really shitty at parts\""]
["04:01,120","04:04,840","\"But I still just love the overall package Julian what would you say is your favorite?\""]
["04:04,840","04:09,080","\"My top favorite of all time would probably have to be Pikmin. Oh, yeah\""]
["04:09,080","04:13,000","\"I really I really very much enjoy melee is probably one of my favorite games of all time\""]
["04:13,000","04:19,120","\"Melee is a lot of fun because that I game had never blown me away so hard at a given point in that\""]
["04:19,120","04:20,940","\"It was such a good\""]
["04:20,940","04:25,060","\"Yeah, like it's a big jump in every I would certainly say so not only that\""]
["04:25,060","04:28,900","\"But they made it a really short window and everything to and I still play the most out of all them\""]
["04:28,900","04:32,660","\"It's it's a lot of fun, but the new one just came out. So I shouldn't say that\""]
["04:32,660","04:38,360","\"I might play that one a lot. We'll see it's true who is to say\""]
["04:38,600","04:42,440","\"Have you unlocked everybody I have no I just got it. I literally just put it in\""]
["04:42,440","04:50,140","\"People were very angry because I was I streamed it and I was playing with the switch controller like button control it good\""]
["04:50,140","04:55,060","\"The switch is playing like with the screen on and everything no you wouldn't have been you would\""]
["04:55,060","05:02,460","\"Honestly the problem is - if you're gonna play smash that's a game that everybody is gonna look at you and be like\""]
["05:02,460","05:06,760","\"I could do better. I think smash the lead is my least favorite gamers of all time\""]
["05:06,760","05:11,700","\"I don't hear from them too often. I always hear people complain about them\""]
["05:11,700","05:17,260","\"I don't really hear from them often, but I smash it's if you play it on a stream you will hear from them\""]
["05:17,260","05:22,140","\"Yes, I would say that's just the comment section like mentality though rather than the smash scene\""]
["05:22,140","05:25,020","\"But is this the thing with smash brothers?\""]
["05:25,020","05:29,060","\"What's weird to me is just how people like act in general like how intense they get about it\""]
["05:29,060","05:33,300","\"But while Luigi stuff had people going insane and it's weird to me because\""]
["05:33,640","05:39,360","\"The the one that people were doing it for before was Ridley and then they got Ridley and nobody said anything\""]
["05:39,360","05:44,600","\"They just started to latch on the wall of Ouija and got mad about that instead. Yeah, it's like you're just making it clear\""]
["05:44,600","05:46,860","\"This is a dumb meme. You're running now. Yeah, I\""]
["05:46,860","05:53,280","\"Feel bad for the team. I hope they didn't have to like hear a lot of that. You know they did that's how we did\""]
["05:53,280","05:56,280","\"But whatever\""]
["05:56,280","06:01,220","\"What the fuck it's out it's here. How do we get down there? Super Smash Brothers\""]
["06:02,400","06:06,740","\"This is a very good song. I like it. I do. I really like this one. This is probably my favorite. I think\""]
["06:06,740","06:13,340","\"This game's got a very laid-back soundtrack. It's nice. You call this laid-back. Well, this one's like party music\""]
["06:13,340","06:17,880","\"I like this one. You know, some of them were very laid-back. Yeah, there it is\""]
["06:17,880","06:22,540","\"I probably like this one because it's very like I would call this one laid-back in the sense that the\""]
["06:22,540","06:26,120","\"BPM is not very intense. It's not that high\""]
["06:26,120","06:29,460","\"This is nice music to be listening to while rolling a marble\""]
["06:29,800","06:33,200","\"That is true you can have a high energy song. That's not necessarily fast\""]
["06:33,200","06:38,200","\"So let's get you just get you parked. It's okay. I\""]
["06:38,200","06:41,600","\"Love this game. Yeah\""]
["06:41,600","06:47,520","\"That new game I played I already talked about the rabbit overgrowth game. That's how this more but though\""]
["06:47,520","06:53,040","\"You tell me more I didn't I didn't know nothing no no no no. Oh that game's right up my alley cuz I like\""]
["06:54,040","06:57,640","\"physics-based fighting stuff, which I don't think there's enough of.\""]
["06:57,640","06:58,440","\"No.\""]
["06:58,440","07:01,640","\"And it's very just fun to jump around, run around.\""]
["07:01,640","07:04,600","\"Combat doesn't get enough exploration in games.\""]
["07:04,600","07:06,600","\"I think it's because people...\""]
["07:06,600","07:09,640","\"Typically the games that would have combat tied to them...\""]
["07:09,640","07:10,200","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:10,200","07:13,880","\"Are things that are usually more story-focused anyways at this point.\""]
["07:13,880","07:17,000","\"So I guess they just don't want to put the emphasis as it would hold players back.\""]
["07:17,000","07:19,480","\"But I like seeing when people experiment.\""]
["07:19,480","07:21,560","\"That game does a lot with it too. It's cool.\""]
["07:21,560","07:25,080","\"It was really weird, like, um, when I was streaming it, people were like, \"\"This looks like shit.\"\"\""]
["07:25,080","07:26,040","\"And I'm like, \"\"Does it?\"\"\""]
["07:26,040","07:27,960","\"Like, it's so fun, like it's...\""]
["07:27,960","07:31,880","\"\"\"Is it just like shit is in, like, they didn't like how it literally looked?\"\"\""]
["07:31,880","07:33,960","\"Or they would just like, \"\"Oh, this looks like it wouldn't be.\"\"\""]
["07:33,960","07:35,160","\"-Not her, like... -Fucking the play.\""]
["07:35,160","07:40,040","\"It's like, it's really fast and like ragdolly and the graphics look like it's...\""]
["07:40,040","07:41,720","\"It looks like it's from 10 years ago.\""]
["07:41,720","07:44,200","\"-I mean, it was in development since ages ago. -Yeah.\""]
["07:44,200","07:45,960","\"But like, it's like, who cares? It's fun.\""]
["07:45,960","07:49,960","\"Like, you could jump around and like ragdoll people and get stuck on spikes and all this other fresh shit.\""]
["07:49,960","07:52,200","\"- That's why I would say that's a flawed thing to start on\""]
["07:52,200","07:53,960","\"is by saying this looks like shit because it's like,\""]
["07:53,960","07:55,320","\"okay, well, what do you mean by that?\""]
["07:55,320","07:56,840","\"As in visually, it looks like shit.\""]
["07:56,840","07:58,600","\"Does it look like it plays poorly?\""]
["07:58,600","08:01,720","\"- I mean, people like it looks better than like,\""]
["08:01,720","08:03,240","\"like let's say GTA 4.\""]
["08:03,240","08:05,040","\"- I don't remember it being hideous.\""]
["08:05,040","08:05,880","\"- Yeah, it's not.\""]
["08:05,880","08:06,720","\"I thought it looked good.\""]
["08:06,720","08:08,200","\"It had good colors and it like,\""]
["08:08,200","08:09,600","\"the models are a little poly member.\""]
["08:09,600","08:10,560","\"- I have no idea anymore.\""]
["08:10,560","08:12,760","\"I remember I was watching something a while back\""]
["08:12,760","08:15,440","\"and I was only watching out of curiosity,\""]
["08:15,440","08:17,600","\"but they mentioned like old NES games and they say,\""]
["08:17,600","08:18,440","\"- I was just gonna say.\""]
["08:18,440","08:20,440","\"to play things that look like this.\""]
["08:20,440","08:21,520","\"- I was just gonna say that.\""]
["08:21,520","08:23,720","\"- They make a comparison to Bethesda saying like,\""]
["08:23,720","08:25,920","\"\"\"Wow, Bethesda's got nothing on this.\"\"\""]
["08:25,920","08:28,760","\"Lickering sprites, we actually used to play games\""]
["08:28,760","08:30,480","\"that look like this and it's like, what?\""]
["08:30,480","08:32,760","\"Okay, that's not that big of a deal.\""]
["08:32,760","08:34,960","\"Compared to a game like, you know, crashing in that.\""]
["08:34,960","08:35,960","\"- Yeah, no!\""]
["08:35,960","08:38,000","\"- You know, funny timing!\""]
["08:38,000","08:39,880","\"Wow, son!\""]
["08:39,880","08:40,840","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:40,840","08:41,920","\"- What happened?\""]
["08:41,920","08:43,640","\"- Welcome back to Marvel it up.\""]
["08:43,640","08:45,120","\"- The crashiest of the game.\""]
["08:45,120","08:47,240","\"- I think the game version was kidding.\""]
["08:47,240","08:49,000","\"You said it was a sequel to Crash Bandicoot.\""]
["08:49,000","08:50,560","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:50,560","08:52,040","\"- I am funny, you'll see.\""]
["08:52,040","08:53,360","\"- Oh, wow!\""]
["08:53,360","08:54,440","\"- I was not expecting that.\""]
["08:54,440","08:55,800","\"I'm sorry, I'm screwed.\""]
["08:55,800","08:56,640","\"(screaming)\""]
["08:56,640","08:58,280","\"- I know with visuals and games though,\""]
["08:58,280","09:00,000","\"an outside audience is gonna probably take it\""]
["09:00,000","09:01,440","\"in a little different than people who,\""]
["09:01,440","09:02,920","\"like, you know, we're doing it hard.\""]
["09:02,920","09:05,280","\"- It just, I don't know, I was just like,\""]
["09:05,280","09:08,400","\"this is a game that has a bunch of fun mechanics,\""]
["09:08,400","09:11,040","\"and all these new games have no mechanics,\""]
["09:11,040","09:12,280","\"it's literally just you running around,\""]
["09:12,280","09:15,480","\"clicking on people, and they fall over and die, usually.\""]
["09:15,480","09:19,560","\"It's I mean it depends on where you're looking and the problem is the scope\""]
["09:19,560","09:23,760","\"It least if you're looking for something bigger budget, you're probably not gonna find a lot of these things\""]
["09:23,760","09:27,760","\"These ideas obviously are gonna come out of a smaller end, but yeah, I don't know\""]
["09:27,760","09:32,080","\"I thought that game looks serviceable, but I I guess it just depends for people\""]
["09:32,080","09:37,720","\"Like I couldn't believe that people will look back on some NES games and say like oh no\""]
["09:37,720","09:42,360","\"They're completely hideous when they're like pushing it and making it look still pretty nice despite the hardware limitations\""]
["09:42,360","09:45,960","\"There's a yeah, there's a few any escapes a still like hold up like artistically\""]
["09:45,960","09:49,880","\"I think there's a lot of super Nintendo games that easily hold up artistic. Yeah totally\""]
["09:49,880","09:52,920","\"But I know there are people who feel that way where it's just like no\""]
["09:52,920","09:59,480","\"Oh, I know the age of it is enough to kind of put them out. So I don't know it can always vary from people. Oh\""]
["09:59,480","10:06,000","\"I'm sorry. I'm trying not to grunt. You really can't just blast through this one. No, you have to wait a little bit\""]
["10:06,000","10:09,800","\"That's why they have the timers on the outside. This is no more blast. You know\""]

["10:28,080","10:32,660","\"That's actually a thing I've run into in my game where\""]
["10:32,660","10:36,560","\"Where you want infinite jumps where it's really fun to end like\""]
["10:36,960","10:42,640","\"Put it in as a power-up in the way the coders have it set up is that like how many jumps you can have\""]
["10:42,640","10:47,740","\"If you set it to infinite, it's really fun to jump around. I'm like if this is fun now should I keep it?\""]
["10:47,740","10:51,080","\"I don't know as a cheat code. That's why developers do stuff like that\""]
["10:51,080","10:55,200","\"I guess that's true and it's a single-player game. So who cares? That's the other end of it\""]

["14:04,340","14:05,180","\"- We've talked about Pizza Tower.\""]
["14:05,180","14:06,020","\"- It's cool.\""]
["14:06,020","14:06,860","\"- It's neat.\""]
["14:06,860","14:07,700","\"It's about maximizing speed.\""]

["14:11,940","14:12,860","\"- There was someone making a game\""]
["14:12,860","14:14,140","\"that looked like a Pacific Rim\""]
["14:14,140","14:16,100","\"where you're inside of the huge Mac\""]
["14:16,100","14:17,220","\"and you're throwing punches\""]

["14:31,460","14:35,360","\"Just in the side damn it just like how it's sort of like\""]
["14:35,360","14:38,020","\"Looks a little bit and how the maths are laid out\""]
["14:38,020","14:43,860","\"But the idea behind it is you can't see anybody always you have to look at their screen to figure out where they are so you can shoot them\""]
["14:43,860","14:46,180","\"It's actually a lot of fun\""]
["14:46,900","14:50,500","\"Umbrella warriors looks like fun. It's a run and gun shooty game\""]
["14:50,500","14:56,400","\"It's neat. What's that game that donkey played where you're like at a party with a sniper and you have to guess who's that looks funny\""]

["15:00,260","15:04,380","\"But Twitter is shitty, but I will say all the games that I'm anticipating\""]
["15:04,380","15:09,120","\"I've been finding through there you can find some really cool stuff if you search the hashtag indie dev\""]
["15:09,120","15:14,000","\"That's what I did or just following people like following lots of independent developers\""]
["15:14,000","15:20,440","\"They spread their own stuff around you you can find a lot of cool stuff if nothing's really been like, you know exciting you lately\""]
["15:20,440","15:25,640","\"Pretty much everything I'm anticipating. I think I found off Twitter now through independent developers. Yeah\""]
["15:25,640","15:31,440","\"Everyone's making really neat stuff. There's a lot of hand-drawn games coming out now, which is neat. I\""]
["15:31,440","15:36,880","\"Wasn't like that people are actually trying with hand-drawn animation and games. I'm so happy\""]
["15:36,880","15:40,080","\"Sorry if it takes me a second to look up this shit\""]
["15:40,880","15:44,060","\"Crash intense has all the nice hand drawn animation\""]
["15:44,060","15:50,980","\"And it feels really good too. Look there's a cool one digital opus tested the climbing system on a moving character\""]
["15:50,980","15:53,780","\"That looks fun. Looks like shadow the classes. I\""]
["15:53,780","15:57,500","\"Remember there was one that I found where a guy was doing a combat test\""]
["15:57,500","15:58,820","\"I don't know if he's taking it anywhere\""]
["15:58,820","16:04,780","\"I think he might be because he had a demo but it was a guy like swinging a stop sign around and it was a 3d thing in unity\""]
["16:04,780","16:06,780","\"Let me restart that was bad\""]
["16:07,680","16:10,800","\"By the way people watching me play I'm sorry. I'm gonna stink at this too\""]
["16:10,800","16:13,780","\"I have not played this since it came out now you go up here\""]
["16:13,780","16:20,000","\"And see now there's crazy things afoot like a gem\""]
["16:20,000","16:29,180","\"Did you know that the opposite of gem is Meg no, that's that's a gem in reverse. There's a difference\""]
["16:29,180","16:31,180","\"It doesn't mean the opposite\""]
["16:31,180","16:37,520","\"That's the inverse no doesn't that be that's the opposite turn a gem backwards\""]
["16:37,520","16:39,520","\"so that it turns into Meg Griffin.\""]

["16:51,920","16:52,760","\"like Tony Hawk,\""]
["16:52,760","16:53,600","\"but I was gonna ask,\""]
["16:53,600","16:55,240","\"is it like a Tony Hawk style thing?\""]
["16:55,240","16:56,160","\"- Or is it like skate?\""]
["16:56,160","16:59,400","\"- It seems like a physics based skating thing.\""]
["16:59,400","17:00,240","\"- So it looks good though.\""]
["17:00,240","17:01,080","\"- It looks like skate.\""]
["17:01,080","17:02,280","\"- 'Cause skate was pretty physics based.\""]
["17:02,280","17:04,800","\"It was broken, but it was physics based,\""]
["17:04,800","17:06,160","\"I'm mostly everything.\""]
["17:06,160","17:07,760","\"Well, I can't say until their game's done.\""]
["17:07,760","17:09,640","\"I think they might change it, I don't know.\""]
["17:09,640","17:11,640","\"But it looks like it's more physics base right now.\""]
["17:11,640","17:13,040","\"(upbeat music)\""]
["17:13,040","17:13,880","\"Oh.\""]
