["05:35,780","05:41,660","\"Well, I mean, that's why I probably did so well though. They're trying to hit a really specific market within the market. Yeah\""]
["05:41,660","05:50,140","\"If you could see inside of an eight year old's mind this game is pretty close to what it probably would look like in terms\""]

["06:44,460","06:47,340","\"Bart Simpson was my favorite character ever.\""]
