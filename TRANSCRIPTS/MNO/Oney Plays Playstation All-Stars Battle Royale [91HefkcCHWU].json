["05:36,960","05:39,960","\"Well, it's not distracting visually.\""]
["05:39,960","05:43,460","\"That's true. We'll actually be able to tell where the fuck we are\""]
["05:43,460","05:52,440","\"Wow, this is a big room sure is right. It's nothing else so we can give it that get out of here you fucking dog\""]
["05:52,440","05:55,220","\"I'm a cat. I know I get an advantage\""]
["05:55,220","06:00,800","\"This game feels like a\""]
["06:00,800","06:04,280","\"Let's say positives\""]
["06:04,280","06:06,440","\"It's stupid no\""]
["06:06,440","06:08,760","\"Big\""]
["06:08,760","06:13,480","\"Jackson it and look parappa Jack hasn't been in the game in a while\""]
["06:13,480","06:17,680","\"Prappa hasn't been in a game a long time either, and I'm glad it was this one. Oh, yeah\""]
["06:17,680","06:27,880","\"The property is still out there and nothing's being done with it. That's not true. They did a remastered\""]
["06:27,880","06:35,380","\"Did anybody care when I don't think it's sold I wonder if this was at all eye-opening for them like oh shit\""]
["06:35,380","06:43,080","\"We have no characters that people like really really attached to or we know what we used to we used to have characters that people\""]
["06:43,080","06:48,380","\"Were really attached to but now like we haven't done anything with them in fucking 12 years\""]
["06:48,380","06:51,580","\"Oh, I\""]
["06:51,580","06:58,180","\"Hope that the opposite wasn't gleamed from it where it's like oh, yeah, nobody's interested in Jack and Parappa anymore\""]
["07:02,180","07:07,540","\"They're just fucking suits man. They don't understand true art. They don't know Parappa\""]
["07:07,540","07:14,580","\"But me I know Parappa in real life. He's my best friend. He lives in my soup\""]
["07:14,580","07:16,500","\"I\""]
["07:16,500","07:20,980","\"Wonder if anybody like claimed to be the best PlayStation all I'm sure in the world\""]
["07:20,980","07:25,820","\"I wonder if they claimed it if anybody would contest that or if they would just be like okay\""]
["07:25,820","07:31,260","\"There's people who are like I'm the best at Tumba - it's like okay\""]
["07:31,260","07:34,740","\"Are you just saying that because of that video the speedrun of it?\""]
["07:34,740","07:38,580","\"Yeah, and some people just pick games like that because no one else wants to touch it.\""]
["07:38,580","07:40,380","\"Oh, that's absolutely true.\""]
["07:40,380","07:43,300","\"People will pick games like that because nobody plays them so they can be the only one.\""]
["07:43,300","07:47,420","\"Hey, Wild Woody has one speedrun out there and the guy makes mistakes all over the place\""]
["07:47,420","07:49,340","\"and anyone wants to compete against that.\""]
["07:49,340","07:53,500","\"I like that this big empty room has yielded the best conversation.\""]
["07:53,500","07:55,220","\"It's true of this entire play.\""]
["07:55,220","07:57,140","\"Would the devil make crying in most things?\""]

["07:58,140","07:59,140","\"It was, yeah.\""]
["07:59,140","08:00,140","\"I think that was a good piece.\""]
["08:00,140","08:01,560","\"- That's what that does.\""]
["08:01,560","08:02,980","\"- But fucking, yeah, no.\""]
["08:02,980","08:05,760","\"The thing about the big empty room is it's kind of like\""]
["08:05,760","08:09,180","\"being stuck in an elevator, which is to say slightly more\""]
["08:09,180","08:11,740","\"pleasant than the rest of the experience of this game.\""]
["08:11,740","08:14,820","\"- If you were stuck in an elevator with Dante,\""]
["08:14,820","08:17,420","\"Nathan Drake, and Ego Cole, would you go,\""]

["08:45,020","08:45,860","\"- That would be good.\""]
["08:45,860","08:48,980","\"- I'm very fascinated to actually look up\""]
["08:48,980","08:51,020","\"like how they promoted this.\""]
["08:51,020","08:52,220","\"Or maybe they didn't promote it\""]
["08:52,220","08:53,900","\"'cause they knew what they were working with was.\""]
["08:53,900","08:55,700","\"- Why was the tester even a thing?\""]
["08:57,620","08:59,380","\"because they needed some testing done.\""]
["08:59,380","09:01,500","\"- And they needed to find the ultimate gamer.\""]
["09:01,500","09:02,340","\"- Yeah.\""]
