["06:25,660","06:26,900","\"Two to three, Ryan Burr.\""]
["06:26,900","06:29,100","\"Let's go back to the year, 1979.\""]

["06:37,580","06:39,220","\"thereof, you jump in real life.\""]
["06:39,220","06:41,820","\"There's a lot of video games that do revolve around jumping.\""]
["06:41,820","06:42,720","\"That's true.\""]
["06:42,720","06:44,620","\"It is like a strange go-to.\""]
["06:44,620","06:48,320","\"Uh, jumping around is a fun thing to do.\""]
["06:48,320","06:49,420","\"You know what I think they came from?\""]
["06:49,420","06:51,320","\"When's the last time you jumped, Chris?\""]
["06:51,320","06:53,120","\"Lyle, okay, imagine...\""]
["06:53,120","06:54,020","\"Just imagine, right?\""]
["06:54,020","06:54,520","\"You got to do.\""]
["06:54,520","06:57,520","\"Just imagine you fucking Lancelot motherfucker.\""]
["06:57,520","06:58,420","\"I don't know why I said that.\""]
["06:58,420","06:58,920","\"Oh, God.\""]
["06:58,920","07:00,420","\"Just imagine that you're out at a...\""]
["07:00,420","07:02,120","\"I didn't even push anything button there.\""]
["07:02,120","07:03,920","\"Imagine you're outside, right?\""]
["07:03,920","07:05,920","\"You stupid fucking idiot.\""]
["07:05,920","07:08,120","\"Imagine you're outside and you are...\""]
["07:08,320","07:13,460","\"You see all these platforms made of like you know that foam that you can smack around your friends with like like the full adventure foam\""]
["07:13,460","07:20,020","\"No, well that would work to be a good work to imagine there's platforms into that and if you fall off you land on that\""]
["07:20,020","07:22,920","\"That's fun. You're jumping around on low platforms trying to challenge yourself\""]
["07:22,920","07:29,040","\"Okay, when's the last time that's happened never it's never happened, but it would be fun if you could do it\""]
["07:29,040","07:34,400","\"Well video games give you the ability to do that what I was a little kid when I was a little fucking infant\""]
["07:34,400","07:37,440","\"I thought that's a little diva with a pitchfork. Yeah, that's uh\""]
["07:37,840","07:42,380","\"Well, I was a little kid. I always said about what if the of all the sidewalks and roads were placed with trampolines\""]
["07:42,380","07:46,520","\"I don't think you have to catch that\""]
["07:46,520","07:50,100","\"I know but it's just a thing where it waves in front of you and you're like god damn it\""]
["07:50,100","07:54,460","\"I want to do it. I think it seems I don't want this fucking thing to have smart me, you know\""]
["07:54,460","08:01,140","\"Well, then stop chasing it. That's how you win. I guess you're right. I guess you have a little a little tiny point\""]
["08:02,780","08:05,660","\"Like, I've caught it twice now.\""]
["08:05,660","08:06,700","\"It just dropped me off.\""]
["08:06,700","08:08,540","\"I think you're supposed to butt slam it.\""]
["08:08,540","08:13,780","\"I think you're literally just supposed to do this.\""]
["08:13,780","08:15,820","\"If you tail whip it, does it?\""]
["08:15,820","08:16,320","\"No.\""]
["08:16,320","08:17,700","\"No, you have to have to have to have to slam it.\""]

["08:43,660","08:45,580","\"I don't know.\""]
["08:45,580","08:50,620","\"This, this, this game is, uh, is definitely the best, but it's also not very good.\""]
["08:50,620","08:51,940","\"The best of what?\""]
["08:51,940","08:58,020","\"It's, it's probably one of the best games ever, but there's just something off about it, you know, that, that's my critique.\""]
["08:58,140","09:01,820","\"That's my little pity I think this game is also the best but also the worst out of the hell\""]
["09:01,820","09:03,180","\"Yeah, there's just something off\""]
["09:03,180","09:08,780","\"Crock has got that game feel is one of the best games ever bad game feel I also feel like\""]
["09:08,780","09:12,300","\"This game has a did you just go in a big fucking circle is this yeah?\""]
