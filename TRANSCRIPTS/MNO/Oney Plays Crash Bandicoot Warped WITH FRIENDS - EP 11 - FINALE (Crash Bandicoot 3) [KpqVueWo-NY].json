["01:44,860","01:47,460","\"- Yo, how about these bullets actually fucking count?\""]
["01:47,460","01:49,300","\"- You have to shoot the engines, I think.\""]

["01:55,580","01:58,420","\"Shoot the one the left and then the one the right. That's a fun sound\""]
["01:58,420","02:03,160","\"What if what's the point of having them there to shoot if you can't chance dad flew by in a plane?\""]
["02:03,160","02:06,740","\"Look at this shit. Look at this fucking cuz he says he's gonna cut them down\""]
["02:06,740","02:13,140","\"I'm gonna cut down the ethernet ethernet. What the ethernet's what allows the internet to flow? I\""]
["02:13,140","02:15,700","\"Don't care. I'll kill you all\""]
["02:15,700","02:24,000","\"See this is why two is the best game doesn't have any other shit. That's not true. Look how cool crash looks with his goggles\""]
["02:24,000","02:25,000","\"people's\""]
["02:25,000","02:29,340","\"people I don't even I when I was younger I this was my favorite one I\""]
["02:29,340","02:36,360","\"You know it's weird because when I was younger I recognize that about this one is I did not like the vehicle stages\""]
["02:36,360","02:38,360","\"And it's why I like to more\""]
["02:38,360","02:41,680","\"But for most people yeah, I guess they just forget about the vehicle stages\""]
["02:41,680","02:46,380","\"I always hear people say well, they're not that bad. They're fucking but they're not fun. They're not fun\""]
["02:46,380","02:51,720","\"They're no they're bad. He just kind of put up with them. Fuck come on dude. Fuck off\""]
["02:51,920","02:56,860","\"It's a lot off if they're way up ahead of you not even shooting you may as well just keep them there\""]
["02:56,860","03:01,160","\"Does it de-render them if that you turn the camera? I don't know\""]
["03:01,160","03:03,720","\"So they get behind you\""]
["03:03,720","03:07,120","\"Your lord, I don't imagine I think it spawns them behind you\""]
["03:07,120","03:10,880","\"But I think it de-renders them if they get behind you at least if they're far enough away\""]
["03:10,880","03:13,960","\"off you little bass\""]
["03:13,960","03:16,960","\"Because you gotta think it's a crash band. Did you just bump up ahead of you?\""]
["03:16,960","03:21,560","\"Yeah, that's how planes work look at this fucking god awful fucking mess\""]
["03:21,560","03:50,960","\"Yes! Hey! Hey! It's my head! I did it! Why couldn't this be a platforming level where you jump on planes? That actually would be fun. Yes! That would actually be a really fun idea. Thank you fucking dear Jiminy Christmas. You just created the new best gangatoot game. BANGATOOT! I have a gash in my bandacoot. My bandacoot got a gash! Put him down.\""]
["03:50,960","03:52,960","\"*Grunting*\""]
["03:52,960","04:01,660","\"This song's just stolen from ranthic cortex. Oh another no. Oh, yeah, they brought those back. It's the last level hooray\""]
["04:01,660","04:09,580","\"Why would they bring these back cuz they were the best ones stupid\""]
["04:09,580","04:15,100","\"You look strong\""]
["04:17,140","04:22,060","\"Let's kill the fucking cobra. You know if there is no Egyptian stuff off to the side\""]
["04:22,060","04:25,420","\"This could have just been a normal level from two at least it has the music\""]
["04:25,420","04:29,660","\"This song sounds like it's from the first game. I like this song\""]
["04:29,660","04:36,300","\"It's a it's very downplayed cuz - usually want more dynamic with its music. What do you think about that crocka gator?\""]
["04:36,300","04:40,900","\"He's very big whoa what happens if you shoot the bug with the bazooka?\""]
["04:41,060","04:44,500","\"To go away. I don't think so with a bug zuka. Ah\""]
["04:44,500","04:47,620","\"Spooky in the dark\""]
["04:47,620","04:53,560","\"Dabamum these are good laughing so oh\""]
["04:53,560","04:55,900","\"wasting so much\""]
["04:55,900","04:58,100","\"That's the boy. Okay. No it goes. Oh\""]
["04:58,100","05:02,140","\"Fuck me and my small no fellas no more bug\""]
["05:02,140","05:08,060","\"Come back, but good luck that it needs him a little buggy boy. I mean good luck. I\""]
["05:08,980","05:13,220","\"Found that oh, I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. Oh\""]
["05:13,220","05:15,960","\"Yeah\""]
["05:15,960","05:17,960","\"I'm gonna fucking kill people\""]
["05:17,960","05:25,260","\"In case you never got to experience this in the game. Here's three of these boxes. I don't think we had had we not really actually\""]
["05:25,260","05:28,500","\"What if you went into a mall and Isis was running at you with this\""]
["05:28,500","05:35,420","\"Oops, that's how it would go in real life\""]
["05:37,060","05:42,720","\"The whole the whole whole I found the question boy. This one's not as hard as to thankfully\""]
["05:42,720","05:46,800","\"Yeah, I think they're not because they're not making you fucking back. Yeah, that was stupid\""]
["05:46,800","05:48,800","\"I did that to do it without the bug\""]
["05:48,800","05:54,660","\"Just wait there's probably a secret level that's as bad as that because that was the bad one and two was the secret one\""]
["05:54,660","06:02,180","\"Why is why is why did you see that what the boxes are I'm breaking when I'm ready to shoot them? Yeah, I remember to shoot these well\""]
["06:02,180","06:03,940","\"I'll see if I can make it\""]
["06:03,940","06:08,660","\"Okay, well you probably didn't get everything. Yeah, you didn't get everything right. I didn't but what am I gonna do?\""]
["06:08,660","06:13,420","\"I grab that and turn around and go get you couldn't do it. You didn't jump to get it\""]
["06:13,420","06:16,940","\"What do you mean? I didn't jump to you supposed to find a man turn around?\""]
["06:16,940","06:21,180","\"This fucking game was probably just those nitro crates it was\""]
["06:21,180","06:26,140","\"It might get good. They might get blown up at the end. Maybe that's why that bug is at the end\""]
["06:26,140","06:31,180","\"It's for you to grab it turn around and go back didn't seem like it. It seemed like it\""]
["06:31,180","06:34,620","\"Well, they just gave you a bug outside of the the bonus stage\""]
["06:34,620","06:40,300","\"I think that is what it was for maybe just really shitty of them because they they try to get you to jump on the ending\""]
["06:40,300","06:46,180","\"I don't like slippers. I do. I like having shoes that you can just pop on real quick. Yeah, see I mean oh wait\""]
["06:46,180","06:52,180","\"That's my favorite thing\""]
["06:52,180","06:55,500","\"What a bad way to end the last level whoa\""]
["06:55,500","06:59,200","\"What if he was called whoa bandicoot? It already is\""]
["06:59,940","07:01,140","\"Oh, Bandicoot!\""]
["07:01,140","07:02,500","\"Bug light!\""]
["07:02,500","07:03,820","\"We ready?\""]
["07:03,820","07:04,820","\"Bug fire!\""]
["07:04,820","07:09,140","\"Are we ready for the final confrontation between Crash Bandicoot and Man on Slowboard?\""]
["07:09,140","07:10,340","\"I'm going to end the cortex.\""]
["07:10,340","07:11,140","\"Oh!\""]
["07:11,140","07:14,020","\"This is the best one because this fight is okay.\""]
["07:14,020","07:15,780","\"This one's actually not that bad.\""]
["07:15,780","07:19,140","\"I like the concept of the maps in the middle.\""]
["07:19,140","07:20,540","\"[Laughter]\""]
["07:20,540","07:21,740","\"Don't hurt me!\""]
["07:21,740","07:24,740","\"Why did you beat the game?\""]
["07:24,740","07:25,940","\"It's Mr. Krabs, dude.\""]
["07:25,940","07:27,940","\"He says, \"\"A googugugug.\"\"\""]
["07:27,940","07:29,340","\"That's Popeye.\""]
["07:29,340","07:31,940","\"I'm all stabbed here. My bull.\""]
["07:31,940","07:38,340","\"That's how I could get away from me and dive.\""]
["07:38,340","07:40,540","\"There's a bit of good fucking killed.\""]
["07:40,540","07:42,340","\"A 46 lives.\""]
["07:42,340","07:44,840","\"What were we like struggling for lives all the way through to?\""]
["07:44,840","07:46,240","\"Yep.\""]
["07:46,240","07:48,340","\"That's because too is harder.\""]
["07:48,340","07:49,440","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:49,440","07:52,940","\"I mean this one is hard but in like in the wrong ways.\""]
["07:52,940","07:53,740","\"It's not fun.\""]
["07:53,740","07:55,340","\"It's tedious as it is.\""]
["07:55,340","07:56,740","\"I would say that's accurate.\""]
["07:56,740","08:04,420","\"Mr.. It's fun push it is fun. You're not allowed to use your mask for this fight - because he's there\""]
["08:04,420","08:12,820","\"Julie why aren't you on the edge of your seat? They should they should do a secret last fight. They should do a what? A secret last fight\""]
["08:12,820","08:18,580","\"That's really hard. I like that about Duncan come country - I really like the secret last fight\""]
["08:18,580","08:25,380","\"There was a secret last time off the shield. There's a secret last fight. No, it's really really hard and there\""]
["08:25,860","08:31,580","\"It's actually not hard. It's not that bad, but it's harder than the normal last fight. It's a lot of fun. Oh\""]
["08:31,580","08:35,540","\"Fuck they're gonna do the zoom boom\""]
["08:35,540","08:40,620","\"Because if you're going for a hundred percent in a game they may as well have something like that\""]
["08:40,620","08:45,340","\"This means you're challenging yourself and go all out. Yeah, he does have a red nose normally\""]
["08:45,340","08:47,660","\"Yeah, why do you have a great one in that one level?\""]
["08:47,660","08:50,740","\"I probably just didn't load the correct color get in there\""]
["08:50,740","08:57,580","\"Yeah, he turned into a shoe the world is savored\""]
["08:57,580","09:00,160","\"I want to see him do the fucking dance\""]
["09:00,160","09:04,380","\"I think that kind of destroys the final fight by having a power-up given to you right after\""]
["09:04,380","09:11,260","\"Because they know you want to beat the whole thing. It's true. You got a backtrack now. You got the shoes\""]
["09:11,260","09:15,700","\"You did change while you got my shoe. I'm so stupid\""]
["09:15,700","09:18,460","\"Maybe I should eat a nice big\""]
["09:20,340","09:27,040","\"He's gonna shoot himself. He looks so much more expressive there than the wrath of cortex\""]
["09:27,040","09:30,980","\"What would you do if he sat there and just put his gun in his mouth and blasted a hole in his head?\""]
["09:30,980","09:34,460","\"Put a gun in his mouth like a gun gun. I didn't say that\""]
["09:34,460","09:47,140","\"Andy Gavin fuck you you dip he made 17 games and all look it's Malcolm\""]
["09:47,140","09:52,740","\"Look at these people go out of your way to Horace look at David's again. Look all these people are in the first one\""]
["09:52,740","09:58,180","\"Are they no yes, maybe who knows special thanks sir?\""]
["09:58,180","10:00,540","\"You all these people did a good job with\""]
["10:00,540","10:09,120","\"There's taku I like the platforming levels kind of\""]
