["00:08,380","00:09,280","\"*Ding* \"\"Hooray.\"\"\""]
["00:09,280","00:10,540","\"With friends.\""]
["00:10,540","00:11,380","\"*Cough*\""]
["00:11,380","00:14,400","\"What about... uh... Zapdos?\""]
["00:14,400","00:17,120","\"Uh... Hey, why'd work?\""]
["00:17,120","00:17,760","\"Why would that be-\""]
["00:17,760","00:19,820","\"I Zapdos I would put in my urethra.\""]
["00:19,820","00:21,920","\"Zapdos would shred your insides.\""]
["00:21,920","00:23,140","\"Well, that just is B.\""]
["00:23,140","00:24,900","\"I had a Zapdos. Uh...\""]
["00:24,900","00:26,100","\"It just is B.\""]
["00:26,100","00:27,600","\"I think it'd work for sounding.\""]
["00:27,600","00:29,140","\"You could shove his beak in your peal.\""]
["00:29,140","00:30,740","\"Do straight people know about sounding?\""]
["00:30,740","00:31,240","\"No.\""]
["00:31,240","00:31,740","\"Okay.\""]
["00:31,740","00:32,540","\"What is that?\""]
["00:32,540","00:34,940","\"That's when you stick something in your dick.\""]
["00:34,940","00:35,440","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:35,440","00:36,440","\"Okay.\""]
["00:36,440","00:39,340","\"They have little metal rods that you slide in there.\""]
["00:39,340","00:40,340","\"What about an earbud?\""]
["00:40,340","00:43,540","\"Uh, that could work and it would make it vibrate.\""]
["00:43,540","00:46,340","\"Oh, I'm thinking of Japanese pipe cleaners.\""]
["00:46,340","00:46,840","\"Oh.\""]
["00:46,840","00:47,840","\"That was a rumor.\""]
["00:47,840","00:49,040","\"That scares the shit out of me.\""]
["00:49,040","00:50,340","\"The idea of just shoving something.\""]
["00:50,340","00:52,040","\"Pipes up your pee hole.\""]
["00:52,040","00:53,440","\"I wouldn't want to put anything.\""]
["00:53,440","00:55,640","\"And you're not going to feel pleasure from that.\""]
["00:55,640","00:57,640","\"There's people like the Japanese.\""]
["00:57,640","01:01,680","\"They shove pipe cleaners up their pee hole and they shove a bigger one up there every week until their pee hole was\""]
["01:01,680","01:05,420","\"Yeah, they they've structured out they have different sizes then they fuck each other's pee holes\""]
["01:05,420","01:06,640","\"Did you want to do that?\""]
["01:06,640","01:12,220","\"This is honest is really cute people like it. I don't I don't think I would but uh, no, it's scary as shit\""]
["01:12,220","01:16,400","\"And then if you're stretching it out it means other things can potentially get in there now because you wind\""]
["01:16,400","01:21,200","\"Yeah, I really easy way is you pour a little die coke up your pee hole drop a little mentos in there\""]
["01:21,200","01:24,620","\"Yeah, it'll stretch out and then you dial over the place. He's got a clog\""]
["01:24,620","01:29,620","\"He's gotta clog your pee hole with your fingers so it doesn't come out. Um, still playing Pokemon, huh?\""]
["01:29,620","01:32,540","\"We're still doing this shit\""]
["01:32,540","01:40,700","\"Still playing your stupid fucking game. I see I like some of these designs too. Like I like King is kind of like ride on at the side\""]
["01:40,700","01:46,720","\"Yeah, I'm a I miss the old aesthetic for Pokemon. Yeah, they used to act like everything was a fucking dinosaur\""]
["01:46,720","01:51,140","\"That's an exaggeration obviously it's not everything but there's it's not just that they're dinosaurs\""]
["01:51,140","01:54,300","\"It's the way that he would draw them. Yeah, everything looked like really rocky\""]
["01:54,300","01:57,540","\"Yeah, they had like the rock textures on them and bumps coming off of them\""]
["01:57,540","02:00,840","\"I was about to say the menu has all them looking like that little dinosaur\""]
["02:00,840","02:05,640","\"Yeah, it's cuz right on was the first yeah, right on first part design design\""]
["02:05,640","02:11,660","\"Look Chairman there's back-up head model has anti-elasing on it. It does and a few of the other ones just do not\""]
["02:11,660","02:14,620","\"He also has a little lumps on his back. Yeah\""]
["02:14,620","02:20,460","\"That's his uh dimple his back dimple. That's the spinal cord. No, which is back dimple\""]
["02:20,460","02:25,460","\"Yeah, when you're fat enough, your spine gets sucked into your body.\""]
["02:25,460","02:26,460","\"He's not fat though.\""]
["02:26,460","02:27,460","\"He has his little chubber.\""]
["02:27,460","02:28,460","\"His whole chubber.\""]
["02:28,460","02:31,460","\"His little belly on him.\""]
["02:31,460","02:36,460","\"You know the cards we're looking at at the side?\""]
["02:36,460","02:39,460","\"Is this only the Nintendo 64 version that does that?\""]
["02:39,460","02:40,460","\"No, it's on the Super Game Boy.\""]
["02:40,460","02:45,460","\"So the Nintendo 64 is emulating that thing at the bottom on top of it all?\""]
["02:45,460","02:46,460","\"Yes.\""]
["02:46,460","02:47,460","\"Okay, now you.\""]
["02:47,460","02:49,460","\"It's why you can't skip the title screen\""]
["02:49,460","02:58,180","\"Hmm also, I'm not sure if it's actually properly emulating it or what because the game acts a little bit weird does it?\""]
["02:58,180","03:01,800","\"Yeah, well you sound like a cut the name off. That's the only thing though\""]
["03:01,800","03:08,300","\"What else some of the walking sprites are messing up and there's a little I don't know if I figure that's probably just in the game already\""]
["03:08,300","03:14,340","\"No, some of that stuff wasn't in there. Mm-hmm. There's some visual hiccups that are unique to this. It's cute\""]
["03:14,660","03:19,220","\"So it's not it's not a perfect thing that they're doing with it\""]
["03:19,220","03:26,240","\"It's so cool that you can do it though. I mean this is impressive for an N64 game the fact that you can do those\""]
["03:26,240","03:28,500","\"Yeah, I remember a golden eye\""]
["03:28,500","03:32,940","\"What was it that they they had I think it was a Commodore 64 emulator\""]
["03:32,940","03:36,100","\"They programmed into it and it's unused in the game code\""]
["03:36,100","03:41,700","\"And they were just doing it to see if they could actually push the N64 that far so it's in there in a what emulator\""]
["03:41,700","03:46,980","\"I think it's for Commodore. Look at that. I think it's for Commodore 64. I mean look it up there\""]
["03:46,980","03:52,060","\"But it's it's in the games like code and everything you can use game short code stack to date it\""]
["03:52,060","03:54,220","\"So what can you play on it in the game?\""]
["03:54,220","03:59,000","\"I don't think there's any ROMs in there, but you can put them like into the actual gold my god\""]
["03:59,000","04:04,220","\"So much effort the emulator is there though in the files. They uh they ended up making one\""]
["04:04,220","04:11,300","\"People have been doing a game maker now. They've actually made emulators through game. That's really yeah a game maker\""]
["04:11,300","04:14,420","\"It really came far so you can do stuff like that now.\""]
["04:14,420","04:16,180","\"- Oh, the ZX Spectrum.\""]
["04:16,180","04:17,540","\"- That's it Spectrum.\""]
["04:17,540","04:18,380","\"- Mm.\""]
["04:18,380","04:20,780","\"- 'Cause they're British.\""]
["04:20,780","04:24,460","\"That was dirty fucking British.\""]
["04:24,460","04:25,860","\"- What do you think of Britain, Chris?\""]
["04:25,860","04:26,700","\"- ZX Spectrum.\""]
["04:26,700","04:28,220","\"- I think Britain's all right.\""]
["04:28,220","04:29,940","\"I wish they didn't kill my ancestors.\""]
["04:29,940","04:30,940","\"(crowd cheering)\""]
["04:30,940","04:32,740","\"- Say ZX Spectrum.\""]
["04:32,740","04:33,580","\"- ZX.\""]
["04:33,580","04:34,780","\"- ZX Spectrum.\""]
["04:34,780","04:35,860","\"- ZX Spectrum.\""]
["04:35,860","04:38,620","\"- ZX Spectrum, ZX Spectrum, ZX Spectrum, ZX Spectrum, ZX Spectrum.\""]
["04:38,620","04:40,540","\"It's kinda hard to say.\""]
["04:40,540","04:42,540","\"sounds like a Harry Potter spell.\""]
["04:42,540","04:43,540","\"- Spic Spectrum.\""]
["04:43,540","04:46,380","\"- Spic Spectrum.\""]
["04:46,380","04:47,740","\"- Spic Spectrum.\""]
["04:47,740","04:49,100","\"- You can't say that.\""]
["04:49,100","04:50,260","\"- He grows a spic out of a jar.\""]
["04:50,260","04:51,900","\"- If you can't say Chink, you can't say spic.\""]
["04:51,900","04:52,740","\"- Shut up.\""]
["04:52,740","04:54,460","\"- Chink, Chink, Chink, Chink.\""]
["04:54,460","04:55,740","\"- Why hasn't he learned Chink?\""]
["04:55,740","04:57,580","\"- I get confused 'cause he had Charmander out\""]
["04:57,580","04:59,060","\"and I thought he learned Vinewhip.\""]
["04:59,060","05:03,500","\"- Why hasn't he learned Leach Seed?\""]
["05:03,500","05:04,420","\"- He's evolving.\""]
["05:04,420","05:05,260","\"- Oh.\""]
["05:05,260","05:07,860","\"- Let's look at his dumbass chair,\""]
["05:07,860","05:11,420","\"- The mammalian sprite, good lord, so ugly.\""]
["05:11,420","05:14,500","\"- Is it in gold where it has those circles\""]
["05:14,500","05:16,020","\"start coming out of them?\""]
["05:16,020","05:16,860","\"- Yes.\""]
["05:16,860","05:17,700","\"- Yeah.\""]
["05:17,700","05:18,860","\"- Okay.\""]
["05:18,860","05:19,700","\"- I miss gold and silver.\""]
["05:19,700","05:21,500","\"- The gold and silver looks great.\""]
["05:21,500","05:24,660","\"They really took advantage of the hardware for that one.\""]
["05:24,660","05:25,780","\"- I never played it.\""]
["05:25,780","05:28,100","\"- We should play it sometime later.\""]
["05:28,100","05:29,700","\"The Disney's too close after this one.\""]
["05:29,700","05:30,780","\"- Yeah, I'd love to play it.\""]
["05:30,780","05:31,620","\"- In Ireland.\""]
["05:31,620","05:33,820","\"- Oh my God, I fucking love gold.\""]
["05:33,820","05:35,060","\"- When gold and silver came out,\""]
["05:35,060","05:36,980","\"Ireland was already done with the Pokemon phase.\""]
["05:36,980","05:41,800","\"I thought it was really gay look at his chubby cheeks Lord. He looks like a dog looks like he's going\""]
["05:41,800","05:47,140","\"He just looks like a dope you like long gel dog long gel dog\""]
["05:47,140","05:50,240","\"Jowled oh jowl. He's got those like fucking\""]
["05:50,240","05:54,640","\"Yeah, I can see it yeah, he's got a nice cream cone stuck on him\""]
["05:54,640","05:57,900","\"Why are my legs aching so much today just slap him?\""]
["05:57,900","06:02,660","\"It's probably cuz you don't move you sit in you sit in your desk all day. You probably need a foam roll your legs\""]
["06:04,100","06:08,360","\"What I walk around I walk around more than I do more than I\""]
["06:08,360","06:15,940","\"Walk around more than you do I was up cleaning cleaning the bathroom and maybe it's gonna stuff away\""]
["06:15,940","06:17,940","\"Because I tried to lift you\""]
["06:17,940","06:19,940","\"Full-rolly's important ding dong\""]
["06:19,940","06:22,940","\"Going rolling foam rolling nobody knows about it yet\""]
["06:22,940","06:28,420","\"But it's gonna be the next big medicine thingy when you put your muscle on a piece of foam and you roll it on and\""]
["06:28,420","06:30,700","\"Then you feel better soon\""]
["06:32,700","06:35,980","\"tells you you'll feel better you feel better.\""]
["06:35,980","06:37,700","\"- What would you do if Aaron walked in,\""]
["06:37,700","06:39,540","\"rolled Manic-eyed and he grabbed your lip\""]
["06:39,540","06:41,060","\"and cut it off with his scissors?\""]
["06:41,060","06:42,220","\"- With his scissors?\""]
["06:42,220","06:44,020","\"- I said, \"\"Oh, the Aaron Hanson.\"\"\""]
["06:44,020","06:45,420","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:45,420","06:46,420","\"- He went, \"\"Awesome.\"\"\""]
["06:46,420","06:47,780","\"And walked out.\""]
["06:47,780","06:48,620","\"- That's what he says.\""]
["06:48,620","06:49,660","\"- He said, \"\"I make a cartoon about it.\"\"\""]
["06:49,660","06:52,020","\"- That's what the person's poor says.\""]
["06:52,020","06:52,860","\"- Awesome.\""]
["06:52,860","06:56,940","\"- Why aren't the bald men in these games anymore?\""]
["06:56,940","06:58,940","\"- I don't know.\""]
["06:58,940","06:59,940","\"- I like in Pokemon Yellow,\""]
["06:59,940","07:02,460","\"they let you get Bulbasaur, Charmander.\""]
["07:02,460","07:05,060","\"I kind of don't like that.\""]
["07:05,060","07:06,180","\"Why?\""]
["07:06,180","07:07,740","\"'Cause I think it ruined a lot of the fun.\""]
["07:07,740","07:09,660","\"You could just catch everything in it.\""]
["07:09,660","07:10,500","\"Oh, perc--\""]
["07:10,500","07:11,980","\"For me, I personally, I--\""]
["07:11,980","07:12,820","\"God damn it.\""]
["07:12,820","07:16,180","\"I liked whenever they added simplification to the game\""]
["07:16,180","07:17,860","\"because I didn't--\""]
["07:17,860","07:20,940","\"Well, I was in the thing about you being able to catch up.\""]
["07:20,940","07:23,460","\"Like, it would have Pokemon from both versions.\""]
["07:23,460","07:24,980","\"It didn't have all of them.\""]
["07:24,980","07:27,500","\"I didn't have all of them, but it had a lot of them\""]
["07:27,500","07:29,420","\"were combined.\""]
["07:29,420","07:32,380","\"And I liked the thing about Bulbasaur and Charmander\""]
["07:32,380","07:36,380","\"because I didn't, I had friends that like played Pokemon,\""]
["07:36,380","07:38,380","\"but I could never fucking trade with them.\""]
["07:38,380","07:40,380","\"- Yeah, see that's why I liked it.\""]
["07:40,380","07:42,380","\"It's 'cause I had friends play Pokemon,\""]
["07:42,380","07:43,380","\"but no one had the cable.\""]
["07:43,380","07:46,380","\"- Yeah, well that too, even when I had a friend that did it,\""]
["07:46,380","07:47,380","\"like sometimes they would just be like,\""]
["07:47,380","07:48,380","\"\"\"Yeah, I don't have a cable.\"\"\""]
["07:48,380","07:50,380","\"- Wait, can you go fishing?\""]
["07:50,380","07:52,380","\"- You're only gonna catch magic cards.\""]
["07:52,380","07:53,380","\"- You're only gonna catch magic cards.\""]
["07:53,380","07:54,380","\"- Fish in the statue.\""]
["07:54,380","07:57,380","\"All right, I'll do it.\""]
["07:57,380","07:59,380","\"Why am I talking to this man?\""]
["07:59,380","08:00,380","\"Leave me alone.\""]
["08:00,380","08:00,880","\"Oh.\""]
["08:00,880","08:05,080","\"Do, do, move, move, move away.\""]
["08:05,080","08:08,380","\"I think he could even fish in the yellow in the statues.\""]
["08:08,380","08:09,580","\"Why did I do that?\""]
["08:09,580","08:10,680","\"I have no idea.\""]
["08:10,680","08:13,980","\"They probably just reuse the sprite some for some reason.\""]
["08:13,980","08:15,980","\"This saved space.\""]
["08:15,980","08:18,980","\"You think they just made the statue a body of water so you could walk through it.\""]
["08:18,980","08:21,380","\"That magic herb spreads actually not bad.\""]
["08:21,380","08:21,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:21,780","08:21,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:21,780","08:23,580","\"Why doesn't he have leech seed?\""]
["08:23,580","08:25,380","\"Isn't he supposed to have it by now?\""]
["08:25,380","08:28,180","\"Did he not get it because he got leveled up?\""]
["08:28,180","08:30,280","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["08:30,280","08:36,080","\"Look it up. I don't believe that though. It's suck cuz that's one of the best things for him to have that's true leech seed\""]
["08:36,080","08:37,760","\"Can you look at up?\""]
["08:37,760","08:39,260","\"When does he learn leech seed?\""]
["08:39,260","08:42,680","\"Leep seed leech leech\""]
["08:42,680","08:48,960","\"I think we missed out on it because I think we missed out on it because I don't think they would do that here\""]
["08:48,960","08:50,960","\"You look at it. I don't understand any of it\""]
["08:50,960","08:58,960","\"I'm not a Pokemon master. I'm a Pokemon blaster you blast Pokemon. Yeah, it says level 70 with your\""]
["08:59,840","09:00,840","\"17?\""]
["09:00,840","09:01,840","\"What?\""]
["09:01,840","09:02,840","\"That doesn't make any sense.\""]
["09:02,840","09:04,760","\"Yeah, that means we just fucking missed out on it.\""]

["09:37,200","09:42,000","\"so it's extra damage from Poison. And if you stack that with Leech Seed, it actually\""]
["09:42,000","09:47,080","\"pulls the value from the Poison damage. So each turn you're getting more and more health\""]
