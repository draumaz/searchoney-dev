["02:46,980","02:49,700","\"It's been like fucking three years since I tried napping on my bag\""]
["02:49,700","02:54,800","\"Maybe I'll try it I fucking sit on my back for like ten minutes and then like I'm in another world\""]
["02:54,800","02:58,120","\"I just I'm hallucinating, but I'm still awake and I know I'm still awake\""]
["02:58,120","03:03,860","\"And then I just get this like fucking clear vision of like this cockroach and a spider just like crawling on each other\""]
["03:03,860","03:07,900","\"And I was like okay. No wake up and I just woke up and I was like okay. I'm not doing that again\""]
["03:07,900","03:11,300","\"That's really interesting. It was like it was right as they in front of my eyes\""]
["03:11,300","03:14,860","\"Just the spider and like this weird cockroach hybrid. Interesting. Hey\""]
["03:16,020","03:21,220","\"Hate them both I hate cockroaches and spiders. I don't mind spiders, but I hate cockroaches and I hate cinnipates\""]

["03:40,740","03:44,580","\"They're not they bite they got venom. No, they fucking don't let's they do\""]
["03:44,580","03:49,800","\"How's don't fucking bite why not all cinepe's for years on end they don't fucking\""]
["03:49,800","03:55,860","\"Oh, let's look at my house. They bite it's because in a rare situation if you actually shake one up and hold in your head\""]
["03:55,860","04:02,060","\"For an hour, maybe I'll eventually bite you I'm looking at not all cinepe's what they fucking do is they break their legs off\""]
["04:02,060","04:06,420","\"Which is why they have some of them unless provoked the house centipedes won't bite\""]
["04:06,420","04:09,620","\"But they do bite if you provoke him you're a fucking idiot no\""]
["04:09,620","04:16,020","\"You said yeah, that means they buy it and shake it guys don't go don't get near it\""]
["04:16,020","04:18,980","\"Why would you buy if you pick it up and shake it for that?\""]
["04:18,980","04:23,400","\"Why would you shake it they would bite you anyway? It sees you as a\""]

["04:32,720","04:35,420","\"Then you are still you're that baby you are\""]
["04:36,380","04:41,520","\"I bite you that means if I held a cockroach is not gonna bite me therefore he's less threatening than a fucking house centipede\""]
["04:41,520","04:44,720","\"Therefore you're wrong a roach would try to bite you its mouth isn't big enough though\""]
["04:44,720","04:48,380","\"But I've been bitten by I got bitten by a grasshopper once that shit\""]
["04:48,380","04:52,400","\"It's a roaches fucking love being everywhere and they're everywhere they reproduce like crazy\""]

["05:25,460","05:27,900","\"We used to always see them. Oh, I was saying the piece\""]
["05:27,900","05:34,340","\"They just scare me because of all the legs. I don't like heads with long. They look fucking disgusting. They're scary. They kill spiders, too\""]
["05:34,340","05:36,740","\"They kill cockroaches too, I think.\""]
["05:36,740","05:38,540","\"- Yeah, they're helpful to have around.\""]
["05:38,540","05:40,620","\"Just like I can't stand looking at them.\""]

["05:41,940","05:42,900","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:42,900","05:44,660","\"- I would rather a spider than a house.\""]
["05:44,660","05:47,060","\"- A spider than a roach or a house centipede.\""]
["05:47,060","05:48,900","\"- Spiders at least eat everything else.\""]
["05:48,900","05:49,940","\"- If I have to choose between a roach\""]
["05:49,940","05:52,020","\"and a house centipede, I'm living with a house centipede.\""]
["05:52,020","05:52,940","\"- Spiders aren't gross.\""]
["05:52,940","05:55,500","\"- I probably would too, just because cockroaches\""]
["05:55,500","05:56,500","\"are a fucking infestation.\""]
["05:56,500","05:58,380","\"- Yeah, exactly, that's why I wouldn't want them.\""]
["05:58,380","05:59,220","\"Also, the bigger bunch of--\""]
["05:59,220","06:01,780","\"- House centipedes go to the trouble\""]
["06:01,780","06:02,780","\"of staying out of your way.\""]
["06:02,780","06:05,680","\"Cockroaches can also flight your face. Yeah, they uh\""]
["06:05,680","06:10,780","\"Like they you know they how centipedes always are sticking to a wall or a floor. They can't yeah\""]
["06:10,780","06:13,460","\"They don't they don't like being out in the other way. We're gonna try to kill it\""]
["06:13,460","06:16,920","\"You have an easy time killing also how centipedes won't get in your bed with you and climb on your nose\""]
["06:16,920","06:22,620","\"They stay away fucking cockroaches cockroaches will climb in your bed with you. It's happened to me. Yeah, I\""]
["06:22,620","06:28,220","\"In my first apartment, I woke up in the middle of the night and because there was something itching on my leg\""]
["06:28,220","06:30,500","\"And I was like oh, I don't like that and so I woke up\""]
["06:30,660","06:35,420","\"- I kicked off this cockroach,\""]
["06:35,420","06:38,500","\"and I had a fucking egg sac stuck to my leg.\""]
["06:38,500","06:40,660","\"It was awful, and I couldn't sleep.\""]
["06:40,660","06:41,580","\"- You never got it off.\""]
["06:41,580","06:42,580","\"- I couldn't sleep.\""]
["06:42,580","06:44,660","\"That's right, this is it right here, look.\""]
["06:44,660","06:46,940","\"- It became my new ball sack.\""]
["06:46,940","06:49,020","\"- But it was so fucking gross,\""]
["06:49,020","06:51,940","\"and I was so freaked out, I slept with the light on.\""]
["06:51,940","06:55,180","\"- Oh yeah, if I'm in my bedroom and I see a cockroach,\""]
["06:55,180","06:56,940","\"and it gets away, like if I try to kill it\""]
["06:56,940","06:58,380","\"and it gets away and I can't find it,\""]
["06:58,380","07:00,260","\"I shut my door, stick a towel under it,\""]
["07:00,260","07:01,420","\"and go sleep in the other room.\""]
["07:01,420","07:02,700","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:02,700","07:05,060","\"- I will not tolerate cockroaches.\""]
["07:05,060","07:05,900","\"- Oh.\""]
["07:05,900","07:07,700","\"- It sounded like an angry teacher.\""]
["07:07,700","07:10,900","\"I will not tolerate cockroaches in this classroom.\""]
["07:10,900","07:12,380","\"- That's what I hate about cockroaches, too,\""]
["07:12,380","07:15,860","\"is that you step on them and then they got eggs on you.\""]
["07:15,860","07:17,860","\"- And they crunch, too?\""]
["07:17,860","07:19,420","\"You ever step in one barefoot by accident?\""]
["07:19,420","07:20,940","\"- I don't want folks in all house feeling.\""]
["07:20,940","07:21,900","\"- And they go,\""]
["07:21,900","07:24,300","\"\"\"Spiders all tolerate because I--\"\"\""]
["07:24,300","07:25,620","\"- Spiders I think are neat,\""]
["07:25,620","07:27,380","\"and they also eat the other bugs,\""]
["07:27,380","07:28,180","\"so I'm fine with that,\""]
["07:28,180","07:30,020","\"I like jumping spiders if they were really cute.\""]
["07:30,020","07:32,460","\"- Hey, you know what else do you have there, bugs?\""]

["07:34,140","07:34,980","\"- It's true, they do.\""]
["07:34,980","07:36,180","\"I mean, that's why I'm saying it would be better\""]
["07:36,180","07:37,140","\"than having cockroach.\""]
["07:37,140","07:38,260","\"- The only thing I'm saying is\""]
["07:38,260","07:40,500","\"how centipedes look scarier, that's all I'm saying.\""]
["07:40,500","07:42,620","\"- I mean, that's the clincher for me\""]
["07:42,620","07:44,500","\"is that I don't like how they look.\""]
["07:44,500","07:46,220","\"- They look creepy in Alien.\""]
["07:46,220","07:47,220","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:47,220","07:49,460","\"- Cockroaches are somewhat not like that.\""]

["07:55,020","07:56,140","\"- Like you just can't get rid of them.\""]
["07:56,140","07:58,180","\"No, and they follow you everywhere.\""]
["07:58,180","07:59,460","\"That's it from that point on.\""]

["08:00,300","08:01,140","\"- Yeah, 'cause they're gonna--\""]
["08:01,140","08:02,020","\"- They're practically impossible.\""]
["08:02,020","08:03,440","\"You have to, what you would have to do\""]
["08:03,440","08:06,220","\"is you would have to get rid of every piece of clothing,\""]
["08:06,220","08:08,220","\"every piece of furniture you own,\""]
["08:08,220","08:12,060","\"every pillow, pillowcase, stuffed animal, everything,\""]

["08:18,140","08:21,060","\"you gotta be so careful not to let them get into\""]
["08:21,060","08:22,860","\"the new clothes you're buying or something,\""]
["08:22,860","08:25,060","\"'cause they will never had them,\""]
