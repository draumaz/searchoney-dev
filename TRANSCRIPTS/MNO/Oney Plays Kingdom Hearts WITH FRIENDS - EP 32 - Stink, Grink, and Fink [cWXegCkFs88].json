["00:12,900","00:13,800","\"*Ding*\""]
["00:13,800","00:15,800","\"Uh, I like the environments here.\""]
["00:15,800","00:17,500","\"*Ding*\""]
["00:17,500","00:20,300","\"Do you prefer it here or in the actual game?\""]
["00:20,300","00:21,800","\"I prefer the actual game.\""]
["00:21,800","00:25,500","\"I think the environments are better in the actual game, but all the character models stink.\""]
["00:25,500","00:29,500","\"It's, uh, it's, it's one of those models where it just looks like they hit...\""]
["00:29,500","00:32,400","\"It's a smooth too many times, you know.\""]
["00:32,400","00:36,060","\"I think my issue with the actual game was that they don't change up the environments\""]
["00:36,060","00:37,060","\"enough.\""]
["00:37,060","00:40,620","\"Like it's very spaced out in the course of the game.\""]
["00:40,620","00:43,220","\"That's fair.\""]
["00:43,220","00:47,180","\"I mean the reason that you don't get time to get sick of this is because they were the\""]

["00:52,900","00:53,900","\"Yes.\""]
["00:53,900","00:56,100","\"Do you prefer that over the greatness of the actual game?\""]
["00:56,100","00:58,140","\"Uh, I think they both work.\""]
["00:58,140","01:00,140","\"Very very great\""]

["01:03,260","01:09,700","\"Like this is closer to what they even that you know what this is still more colorful. There's like purples everywhere\""]
["01:09,700","01:13,940","\"Well, but blah blah. I mean the movie itself\""]
["01:13,940","01:18,500","\"Especially when they're monochromatic when it's daytime. It's very great\""]
