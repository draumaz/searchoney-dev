["08:10,660","08:11,660","\"Mmm.\""]
["08:11,660","08:12,660","\"That's...\""]
["08:12,660","08:13,660","\"I would have liked that.\""]
["08:13,660","08:14,660","\"I would have liked that.\""]
["08:14,660","08:15,660","\"Yeah, I think it would have been a lot more interesting.\""]
["08:15,660","08:17,500","\"I think that would have been a lot more fun.\""]
["08:17,500","08:20,580","\"I like a lot of the shop characters in that game, but I don't really care about it.\""]
["08:20,580","08:21,580","\"The shrimp guy is really good.\""]
["08:21,580","08:22,580","\"Yeah, he's my favorite.\""]
["08:22,580","08:23,580","\"He's good.\""]
["08:23,580","08:24,580","\"Because I like tempura shrimp a lot.\""]
["08:24,580","08:25,580","\"I think he looks fun.\""]
["08:25,580","08:27,180","\"What if they look like this?\""]
["08:27,180","08:28,180","\"But when you're...\""]
["08:28,180","08:29,180","\"That'd be worse.\""]
["08:29,180","08:30,180","\"You're going to hit a...\""]
["08:30,180","08:32,700","\"like the gooey man. Then that'd be okay.\""]
["08:32,700","08:33,540","\"- These things are...\""]
["08:33,540","08:36,340","\"- That is a really good rendition of like mucus.\""]
["08:36,340","08:37,980","\"- Yeah, it's really creepy.\""]
["08:37,980","08:41,380","\"- I remember I was really sick and I was throwing up a lot\""]
["08:41,380","08:42,820","\"and that's what it looked like.\""]
["08:42,820","08:45,740","\"- You know what I'll say?\""]
["08:45,740","08:47,420","\"Resident Evil 7 did a really good job\""]

["08:59,700","09:01,300","\"- Oh, it's very, very nice.\""]
["09:01,300","09:06,860","\"- I like that somebody left a little pile of sand\""]
["09:06,860","09:08,460","\"in the middle of this cathedral.\""]
["09:08,460","09:10,460","\"- Of course, what are the sewers?\""]
["09:10,460","09:11,300","\"- Sewers.\""]
["09:11,300","09:13,020","\"- What's a character design you like a lot,\""]
["09:13,020","09:16,300","\"but most people think it's very poorly done.\""]
["09:16,300","09:18,140","\"- Oh man, I don't know.\""]
["09:18,140","09:19,740","\"I can't think of any.\""]
["09:19,740","09:22,180","\"- It's really hard to think of that shit on the spot.\""]
["09:22,180","09:24,180","\"I think you asked me the same question a while back\""]
["09:24,180","09:25,900","\"and I couldn't think of anything.\""]
["09:25,900","09:27,180","\"Would you live in a sewer?\""]

["09:32,060","09:32,900","\"- That's a good point.\""]
["09:32,900","09:33,900","\"- Look at all those chunks.\""]
["09:33,900","09:36,180","\"- Tasty chunks.\""]
["09:36,180","09:38,140","\"- Stupid rat, I knew you were in there.\""]
["09:38,140","09:39,220","\"- Stupid rat.\""]
["09:39,220","09:40,060","\"- Stupid rat.\""]
["09:40,060","09:44,780","\"- I like slipping and sliding through these bloody chunks.\""]
["09:44,780","09:46,140","\"- Do you like rap boy?\""]
["09:46,140","09:47,020","\"- I love rap boy.\""]
["09:47,020","09:48,300","\"- Do you like rap boy?\""]
["09:48,300","09:49,220","\"- That's what I was about to say,\""]
["09:49,220","09:51,120","\"what if it was a rap boy genius?\""]
["09:51,120","09:55,500","\"Oh, I like that door, let me look at him.\""]
["09:55,500","09:56,780","\"- It's all slippery.\""]
["09:56,780","09:57,780","\"Oh, look at him.\""]
["09:57,780","09:59,220","\"It'd be a text to speech voice saying,\""]
["09:59,220","10:01,580","\"what up y'all at Rat Boy Genius?\""]
["10:01,580","10:03,020","\"Oh, there's a giant rat.\""]
["10:03,020","10:03,860","\"He's a big man.\""]
["10:03,860","10:04,700","\"Go right on him.\""]
["10:04,700","10:05,140","\"I can't.\""]
["10:05,140","10:05,860","\"He hurts you.\""]
["10:05,860","10:06,860","\"Oh.\""]
["10:06,860","10:09,580","\"This is one of the most hated levels in the game.\""]

["10:10,100","10:10,500","\"I don't know.\""]
["10:10,500","10:10,940","\"I love it.\""]
["10:10,940","10:11,620","\"I think it's really fun.\""]
["10:11,620","10:13,340","\"Because people hate sewer levels in games.\""]
["10:13,340","10:14,180","\"I know, but this one's actually like--\""]
["10:14,180","10:15,140","\"This isn't like--\""]
["10:15,140","10:15,780","\"Well designed.\""]
["10:15,780","10:16,420","\"You can blast through it.\""]
["10:16,420","10:18,860","\"I never really understood that sort of thing anyways,\""]
["10:18,860","10:21,300","\"because it's just a setting piece.\""]
["10:21,300","10:24,780","\"It's not all sewer levels have to play out the same way.\""]
["10:24,780","10:28,320","\"I used to hate cave levels and games.\""]

["10:32,120","10:34,000","\"- Oh my God, he's tumbling all over.\""]
["10:34,000","10:36,280","\"- Or he's not even like animal crossing.\""]
["10:36,280","10:38,960","\"- I never really played it that much.\""]
["10:38,960","10:41,520","\"- Do you know what happens when you play it a long time?\""]
["10:41,520","10:43,040","\"- You get a burger.\""]
["10:43,040","10:46,540","\"- You get blessed and then you get superpowers.\""]
["10:46,540","10:47,380","\"- Really?\""]
["10:47,380","10:49,800","\"- And you can travel into the villagers' minds\""]
