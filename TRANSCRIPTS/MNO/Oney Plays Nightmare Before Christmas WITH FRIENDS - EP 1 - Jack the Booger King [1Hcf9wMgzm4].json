["08:11,440","08:14,480","\"and then it crashed into the water, and the two guys flew out of it,\""]
["08:14,480","08:16,520","\"and started beating across the surface of the water.\""]
["08:16,520","08:18,120","\"- Yeah, they skipped like the rocks.\""]
["08:18,120","08:19,640","\"- Yeah, it's like if you were playing worms\""]
["08:19,640","08:21,080","\"and you sent someone across the water.\""]
["08:21,080","08:22,080","\"- Yeah, but--\""]

["08:58,860","09:03,720","\"It was like 14 different fights happening. That was an amazing sight to behold\""]
["09:03,720","09:07,360","\"The best part is that there's no context behind it\""]
["09:07,360","09:10,220","\"It just starts with a guy falling over a token machine\""]
["09:10,220","09:13,220","\"And then two other people dragging the star punch again.\""]
["09:13,220","09:14,220","\"[laughter]\""]

["09:52,180","09:55,140","\"There's nothing in me. Should I enter the mat?\""]
["09:55,140","10:02,460","\"Good job. I wish I could do something that funny when we were trying to do the monster mash. He did the man.\""]
["10:02,460","10:08,620","\"He can't do it again. That's a one video thing. I'm scared. God damn it.\""]
["10:08,620","10:10,620","\"These enemies are boring.\""]
["10:10,620","10:12,620","\"Yeah, is it always the same ones?\""]
["10:12,620","10:15,620","\"It's going to be the same song and the same enemies for a while.\""]
["10:15,620","10:16,620","\"Are you serious?\""]
["10:16,620","10:18,620","\"That's probably the one that's...\""]
["10:18,620","10:19,620","\"It starts over too!\""]
["10:19,620","10:25,620","\"Once you get into new areas, it starts to mix it up, but it's not going to be for a while.\""]
["10:25,620","10:28,620","\"It's already overdoing it.\""]
["10:28,620","10:31,620","\"The song starts over each time too.\""]
["10:31,620","10:34,620","\"Well, it doesn't make you remember it better.\""]
["10:34,620","10:35,620","\"Yeah.\""]
