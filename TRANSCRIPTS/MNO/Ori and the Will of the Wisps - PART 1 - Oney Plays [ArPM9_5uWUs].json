["00:54,320","00:54,960","\"*Laughs*\""]
["00:54,960","00:56,960","\"Go back\""]
["00:56,960","00:59,160","\"Absolutely not\""]
["00:59,160","01:05,560","\"Get up you little dickhead. I'm I play as Ori. I think that's Ori\""]
["01:05,560","01:11,480","\"It's job of the hunt\""]
["01:11,480","01:17,280","\"Oh, did you see that you did a little flip that was cool\""]
["01:23,520","01:25,520","\"Whoa, you can't say that\""]
["01:25,520","01:31,960","\"Can't show those and say that\""]
["01:31,960","01:34,720","\"What is that you're dead?\""]
["01:34,720","01:41,740","\"Wait, what is this family dynamic going on? We never play I never played the first one. Yeah that thing dies in the first one\""]
["01:41,740","01:43,740","\"I guess it doesn't I guess it undies\""]
["01:43,740","01:52,720","\"Yeah, there's a second game - we named her cool wait hold on okay, so that's the biological child of that spider and\""]
["01:52,720","01:57,480","\"No face. I don't know. I think they just found it. Yeah, okay\""]
["01:57,480","02:04,440","\"I guess that's fair. So me and Tomar started this game for five minutes straight just to see if it recorded well because it's a\""]
["02:04,440","02:06,520","\"New computer, but um\""]
["02:06,520","02:11,520","\"We were saying that throughout this part. It's showing you, you know falling in love with this little owl and stuff\""]
["02:11,520","02:14,000","\"But it would have been better if they did it through gameplay\""]
["02:14,000","02:21,760","\"Yeah, probably I mean any time you build a relationship with another character through gameplay\""]
["02:21,760","02:29,060","\"It's always a little bit better because nine times out of ten and maybe this is changing because people are more like\""]
["02:29,060","02:31,280","\"\"\"Ooh, video games, I want to get invested in this story!\"\"\""]
["02:31,280","02:39,380","\"But nine times out of ten, especially with kids, you don't really care if the character doesn't have any impact on gameplay or anything like that.\""]
["02:39,380","02:44,660","\"So if you lose something that actually has been helping you, you're like \"\"No, I want it back!\"\"\""]
["02:44,660","02:47,860","\"You know, even if you don't really give a shit about what's going on.\""]
["02:47,860","02:50,460","\"It's because it plays into your mechanics to have more fun.\""]
["02:50,460","02:51,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:51,160","02:54,540","\"That said, I don't know if there is a mechanic designed around the owl\""]
["02:54,540","02:58,360","\"There could have been though. We were saying that he could like let you glide for a bit\""]
["02:58,360","03:03,560","\"There still could be we don't we don't actually know what the game is like past the first five to ten minutes\""]
["03:03,560","03:07,360","\"I'm just assuming he's gonna get kidnapped. I don't think this thing is gonna betray you\""]
["03:07,360","03:14,640","\"You think that dark evil fucking monsters gonna betray little spider monster with no pupils. I think that\""]
["03:15,360","03:20,080","\"That is doing this game's equivalent of what we do to cattle where it's just\""]
["03:20,080","03:23,040","\"Raising you up to get fatter like that thing\""]
["03:23,040","03:25,700","\"And it's gonna eat all of you. I\""]
["03:25,700","03:28,760","\"Like the music a lot. It's very pretty\""]
["03:28,760","03:31,940","\"Maybe you meet that thing in the last game and it's your friend\""]
["03:31,940","03:37,100","\"It probably like chases you for a second and then it becomes friendly\""]
["03:37,100","03:43,200","\"Yeah, cuz when the first game isn't there like a big alchase and you know the third game isn't it?\""]
["03:43,200","03:45,200","\"Is it? No, this is a second game.\""]
["03:45,200","03:49,200","\"Oh, okay. I thought there was one between Ori and the Blind Forest and this for some reason.\""]
["03:49,200","03:55,200","\"Yeah, I did play maybe two hours of Ori and the Blind Forest and it was fine.\""]
["03:55,200","04:00,200","\"It didn't upset me, but it didn't do anything that really...\""]
["04:00,200","04:02,200","\"That sounds identical to my experience.\""]
["04:02,200","04:04,200","\"Yeah, I played it for a little bit.\""]
["04:04,200","04:08,200","\"I'm like, this is kind of sort of like a Metroidvania thing and I'm not super feeling it.\""]
["04:08,200","04:11,200","\"I really liked Hollow Knight though, which was kind of along the same lines.\""]
["04:11,200","04:12,440","\"Yeah, no, I'm with you there.\""]
["04:12,440","04:14,160","\"The first time I played Hollow Knight even,\""]
["04:14,160","04:16,560","\"like I didn't really realize what I was doing\""]
["04:16,560","04:18,240","\"and I played it for like 15 minutes\""]
["04:18,240","04:20,420","\"and then I was like, all right, this is nice.\""]
["04:20,420","04:22,600","\"And I stopped, but then I picked it up another time\""]
["04:22,600","04:26,360","\"and then played it for like two weeks straight.\""]
["04:26,360","04:29,320","\"- Yeah, it's like one of my favorite games now, Hollow Knight.\""]
["04:29,320","04:30,160","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:30,160","04:34,240","\"- Aw, they pet the owl and then kicked it out.\""]
["04:34,240","04:36,220","\"- He's gonna fucked up Nemo Wing.\""]
["04:36,220","04:40,080","\"Nemo Wing.\""]
["04:40,080","04:41,280","\"Oh yeah, he's defective.\""]
["04:41,280","04:42,280","\"Oh, like finding me money.\""]
["04:42,280","04:44,640","\"They're sending it back to the factory.\""]
["04:44,640","04:46,000","\"'Cause they bought a bad one.\""]
["04:46,000","04:51,060","\"My fucking wig sucks.\""]
["04:51,060","04:54,520","\"Is that just a congenital thing?\""]
["04:54,520","04:56,280","\"There was no back story as to why his wig is growing.\""]
["04:56,280","04:57,180","\"Why is his wig growing?\""]
["04:57,180","04:59,360","\"Yeah, that's how they hump.\""]
["04:59,360","05:01,080","\"I meant like he was born with it.\""]
["05:01,080","05:03,080","\"Oh, look at the face on the black dude.\""]
["05:03,080","05:06,040","\"I was born with it too, the dude of color, but yeah.\""]
["05:06,040","05:09,640","\"Yeah, I guess he's more of a colorful man.\""]
["05:09,640","05:11,560","\"He's a rotan monster of color.\""]
["05:11,560","05:12,400","\"- Yeah.\""]
["05:12,400","05:15,440","\"- Tomar, that's me looking up at you.\""]
["05:15,440","05:16,800","\"- Where am I?\""]
["05:16,800","05:18,720","\"- You're the big rock I'm leaning against.\""]
["05:18,720","05:19,560","\"- Aww.\""]
["05:19,560","05:20,400","\"- Yeah, thank you.\""]
["05:20,400","05:24,160","\"- Of all the things that you could be, Telmar.\""]
["05:24,160","05:26,400","\"- Telmar's you, I think, fucking rock.\""]
["05:26,400","05:29,040","\"- Look at that, it's so nice.\""]
["05:29,040","05:30,680","\"It feels good.\""]
["05:30,680","05:31,560","\"- Wow.\""]
["05:31,560","05:34,120","\"- Hey, watch out, those geese fuck things.\""]
["05:34,120","05:36,880","\"- See, those are birds and they swim.\""]
["05:36,880","05:38,480","\"Maybe you can swim.\""]
["05:38,480","05:44,880","\"shove you in just to prove it to you. They're like really nicely blending the music together\""]
["05:44,880","05:54,040","\"too. So are you just sad because it can't fly? Yeah, he's got a stupid wing. Oh, it's\""]
["05:54,040","06:02,600","\"really chapping his ass. But Ori feels bad. Ori hasn't been able to fly his whole goddamn\""]
["06:02,600","06:08,280","\"Yeah, that's fair if the gameplay would have been a lot easier if you could yeah\""]
["06:08,280","06:18,480","\"Before he break his stupid wing I can't believe we'll let me off myself right now\""]
["06:18,480","06:21,760","\"I can't believe it doesn't let you pluck all the feathers out of that bird's face\""]
["06:21,760","06:27,960","\"This is so pretty it's like the movie Avatar all right you got this\""]
["06:27,960","06:31,320","\"Bro, where's the slide around on your ass button dude a\""]
["06:32,080","06:35,440","\"A better video game would have a slide around on your ass button.\""]
["06:35,440","06:36,640","\"*Cough* You're so right.\""]
["06:36,640","06:40,080","\"Or \"\"mother's final game.\"\"\""]
["06:40,080","06:42,080","\"\"\"Mother.\"\"\""]
["06:42,080","06:43,440","\"Wait, I go down there?\""]
["06:43,440","06:45,600","\"Yeah, you just opened that by hanging on that rope.\""]
["06:45,600","06:45,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:45,600","06:47,520","\"Whoo!\""]
["06:47,520","06:52,240","\"I do love controlling this little guy, I'll give it that.\""]
["06:52,240","06:55,520","\"Yeah, he looks like he controls a lot better than the first game.\""]
["06:55,520","06:58,560","\"People told me that in the first game he controls amazingly.\""]
["06:58,560","07:05,680","\"Controls okay. I don't I don't recall it being anything special. I also remember him taking up a weird amount of space on the screen\""]
["07:05,680","07:07,680","\"Rose feather. Okay. Now you can fly\""]
["07:07,680","07:15,060","\"Idiot you can go rub it in that owl's face. That's stupid dumbass never thought of finding a feather in a chest\""]
["07:15,060","07:17,060","\"Well, he doesn't have fingers to grab it\""]
["07:17,060","07:21,440","\"I take back what I said about the gliding around the L earlier\""]
["07:21,440","07:27,400","\"Or he's like hey, I've been holding out on you. I've had this the whole time. This is cool. It's mine\""]
["07:27,400","07:31,500","\"I just want you to know that are we okay by are we gonna give this to the owl?\""]
["07:31,500","07:35,620","\"I'm gonna shove it up his ass\""]
["07:35,620","07:38,760","\"This is from your mommy\""]
["07:38,760","07:42,160","\"Your mother gave birth to this instead of you\""]
["07:42,160","07:45,100","\"What and she's raising it\""]
["07:45,100","07:48,460","\"She's still alive and well right now\""]
["07:48,460","07:53,160","\"Are they gonna like create a hang glider out of that they're gonna tape it to him\""]
["07:53,480","07:58,660","\"They're gonna repair him like and how to train your dragon nor he has to ride him I\""]
["07:58,660","08:06,980","\"Guess I at this point you've seen as much of this as I have okay. Oh look. They're so happy I\""]
["08:06,980","08:16,820","\"Like that thing I don't know what he is, but I like it plug this into the owl what you want me to do what\""]
["08:16,820","08:18,820","\"Oh\""]
["08:18,820","08:27,820","\"Go real it tape I\""]
["08:27,820","08:36,460","\"Could have done that at any time mr. You stupid assholes never thought of this. Oh cool. Oh my god\""]
["08:36,460","08:38,460","\"We were so wrong you asshole\""]
["08:38,460","08:40,580","\"You do get to fly around\""]
["08:42,020","08:46,740","\"No, I'm not wrong. I'm still right. I just made the mistake of trusting my two friends\""]
["08:46,740","08:51,040","\"I still think they shouldn't like tell the story through not playing it\""]
["08:51,040","08:57,920","\"But it seems like they are would you want there was actually like what do you want there press X to frown at the corner of a\""]
["08:57,920","09:03,920","\"This game fucking rocks\""]
["09:03,920","09:06,640","\"Look at this\""]
["09:06,640","09:11,500","\"See I could flap and I can tap they made it they made it good. Yeah\""]
["09:11,500","09:12,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:12,000","09:15,200","\"Can this thing wall jump or no?\""]
["09:15,200","09:17,300","\"The sky was within reach.\""]
["09:17,300","09:20,180","\"- They're gonna do exactly what we talked about.\""]
["09:20,180","09:22,980","\"- But now his idiot friend was on his back.\""]
["09:22,980","09:27,580","\"Oh, no, he's coming back up.\""]
["09:27,580","09:28,580","\"Yeah, look at that.\""]
["09:28,580","09:33,420","\"- So now you have this awesome flying companion\""]
["09:33,420","09:35,620","\"that you're gonna get to play with for another five minutes.\""]
["09:35,620","09:37,060","\"- Yeah, so they're gonna kill him.\""]
["09:37,060","09:38,860","\"- And then he's gonna get kidnapped.\""]
["09:40,020","09:41,660","\"Probably by an evil witch.\""]
["09:41,660","09:43,580","\"That fucking better not.\""]
["09:43,580","09:46,380","\"What if a good witch gives him a hug, Tomar?\""]
["09:46,380","09:48,580","\"And then you play as him the whole game.\""]
["09:48,580","09:51,540","\"I'm not trusting any of your predictions now.\""]
["09:51,540","09:56,980","\"You get to go to the rave in the cave.\""]
["09:56,980","09:58,740","\"Can you believe it?\""]
["09:58,740","10:01,820","\"By the way, I still stand by my point.\""]
["10:01,820","10:05,540","\"This is cool and all, but it would be better if we were playing through a fun-ass level with this thing right now.\""]
["10:05,540","10:09,420","\"Oh yeah, a good flying level on this would probably make this more exciting.\""]
["10:09,420","10:15,300","\"It's a good alternative to a flying level like two seconds. I know but then you don't need all this. That's what I'm saying\""]
["10:15,300","10:17,300","\"That's it point taken\""]
["10:17,300","10:22,700","\"Wish I could sing like a while. Yeah, I mean\""]
["10:22,700","10:28,340","\"That's the lonely mountain from the movie the Hobbit\""]
["10:28,340","10:36,460","\"Wow there it goes all traces of the movie the Hobbit\""]
["10:38,020","10:40,020","\"Go down there. Oh\""]
["10:40,020","10:45,460","\"Great goose he's gonna do that thing from Avatar where he jumps off and steps the big thing with his hair\""]
["10:45,460","10:50,420","\"And then it believes him when it would it would he lies to it\""]
["10:50,420","10:58,180","\"Oh see now they're a part of a goose formation da evil\""]
["11:07,180","11:09,180","\"What if it gets struck by lightning?\""]
["11:09,180","11:15,860","\"Well, I feel like they're placing a little too much confidence in this just repaired wing\""]
["11:15,860","11:18,540","\"Yeah, they're being kind of stupid\""]
["11:18,540","11:23,780","\"They got to fly above the clouds, Tomar. Look at that fucking cloud\""]
["11:23,780","11:28,420","\"Take a look at it. He's trying to get above the storm. Oh\""]
["11:28,420","11:31,500","\"No, he's not oh\""]
["11:36,940","11:37,940","\"Oh no!\""]
["11:37,940","11:41,940","\"That was the house still flying at all if you just lost the...\""]

["12:01,940","12:03,940","\"Ruffus it's hair.\""]
["12:04,940","12:11,260","\"There are little ring-tailed lemurs.\""]
["12:11,260","12:15,940","\"That big shrieking monster saved you from getting eaten by ring-tailed lemurs.\""]
["12:15,940","12:17,940","\"This game is sickeningly beautiful.\""]
["12:17,940","12:20,140","\"Yeah, it looks real good.\""]
["12:20,140","12:25,300","\"I remember the first one looking good too, but not anywhere near this good.\""]
["12:25,300","12:28,380","\"You know, this is just insane.\""]
