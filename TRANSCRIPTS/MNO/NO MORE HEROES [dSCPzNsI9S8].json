["12:40,120","12:46,140","\"I don't know that smash ultimate had that going on yet. Yeah, no, but I feel like you've got to really be living on the edge to be hacking\""]

["12:48,140","12:54,040","\"You're living on the edge, but I feel like modern consoles will like straight up like just incorporate shit\""]
["12:54,040","12:58,920","\"that'll like brick them or they'll like put you like so far behind on like patches and\""]
["12:58,920","13:03,680","\"stuff that you basically need to constantly keep up with the community of people that\""]
["13:03,680","13:06,640","\"is gonna make sure your shit works you know.\""]
["13:06,640","13:12,440","\"That's kind of how like the PSP was because if you get patches that are too far ahead\""]

["14:14,280","14:20,120","\"Hey, we're gonna need to whack off soon. I don't even know what I'm doing dude. Oh shit\""]
["14:20,120","14:27,700","\"You're winning though. You are winning you can definitely mash through this game. I think I played this game so the reason I brought up\""]
["14:27,700","14:33,260","\"Fucking hacking my switch and pirating games. This is one of the games that I pirated\""]
["14:33,260","14:36,960","\"But the second one was also out at the time\""]
["14:36,960","14:40,040","\"So I think I was just kind of like impatient to get through it\""]
["14:40,040","14:43,120","\"And so I didn't really like like I did play all the way through it\""]
["14:43,120","14:48,280","\"But I don't remember super liking it probably because I was like I just want to get to the second one\""]
["14:48,280","14:52,000","\"That's like a bad mindset to play anything. I think yeah\""]
["14:52,000","14:57,520","\"I think I kind of like part of the reason I didn't really dig half-life - was because I also sort of had that mindset\""]
["14:57,520","15:04,120","\"Whoa, but there is no half-life three. Yeah, but I didn't know that at the time. Oh my god. I went super saying you did\""]
["15:04,120","15:06,120","\"I\""]
["15:06,120","15:17,120","\"Is poor guys get me that's right. Yeah, I'm getting it. I'm sort of like they kind of don't deserve it\""]
["15:17,120","15:21,120","\"No my super saying\""]
["15:21,120","15:22,720","\"Oh\""]
["15:22,720","15:24,560","\"That'll teach you\""]
["15:24,560","15:29,580","\"But yeah, I kind of I think I ruined half-life too a little bit for myself because I like thought of it as like\""]
["15:29,580","15:36,540","\"Oh, this is a 10 year old game or whatever when I played it and I was like I'll bet like the the episodes or whatever\""]
["15:36,540","15:42,560","\"I bet those are like way better. Oh man. I kind of I kind of just like you fuck yourself. The episodes are just more of the same\""]
["15:42,560","15:44,800","\"I know exactly they're literally exactly the same\""]
["15:44,800","15:49,020","\"I changed it at all when I beat half-life - I never actually got under the other episodes\""]
["15:49,020","15:51,780","\"They always got bored like really quickly. I don't think I beat them\""]
["15:51,780","15:55,260","\"I think I was like I was expecting basically like a half-life three\""]
["15:55,260","16:00,320","\"I remember seeing like crazy scenes of like bridges bending and buckling over what you missed the church\""]
["16:00,320","16:10,940","\"Our name was Travis and it's time to touchdown\""]
["16:10,940","16:17,020","\"That's his name by the way Chris is a step down Travis. Yeah, yeah, there you go\""]
["16:17,020","16:23,300","\"So what did there was actually pretty clever. I knew you were funny\""]
["16:23,300","16:25,300","\"I\""]
["16:25,300","16:32,000","\"Knew you were something special Dave. Oh, thanks guys. We need more games for blood flies out of people\""]

["17:30,660","17:35,360","\"No, it's fine for girls if you're the pussies to dudes, but also he was already a cool mafia dude\""]
["17:35,360","17:36,960","\"I enjoyed and they ruined him\""]
["17:36,960","17:41,420","\"You're cool. They should have had a character in there from the beginning for girls to flick their beam to you\""]
["17:41,420","17:44,760","\"They put Zack in there and they made him gacked\""]
