["04:45,920","04:49,980","\"In literally seconds I want to clarify that sound effects why I'm laughing\""]
["04:51,200","04:55,920","\"It's funny cuz like every boss like this boss comes in it has like the worst cutscene ever\""]
["04:55,920","04:59,400","\"It just sort of phases in and you just and pop it in two seconds\""]
["04:59,400","05:04,720","\"I was dead and you don't actually level up any devil trigger all you do is purchase devil fruit\""]
["05:04,720","05:11,640","\"Where the fuck it's called who's this talking now devil gems? He's like the shadow person that the hot topic items. Yeah, okay\""]
["05:11,640","05:13,640","\"Yeah, so\""]

["05:19,560","05:23,040","\"I've never been so mad at a game besides Mario maker and\""]
["05:23,040","05:30,720","\"But there's a part where in anyone who's played it on a even if you're playing ironically\""]
["05:30,720","05:35,620","\"You're just laughing along with it you get to this fucking part where you have to fight a zombie helicopter and zombie tank\""]
["05:35,620","05:37,420","\"That's all I want to tell yourself\""]
["05:37,420","05:42,180","\"It is so fucking impossibly hard and long and stupid and boring so we at this part\""]
["05:42,180","05:45,000","\"You have to climb like the Empire State Building pretty much and here\""]
["05:47,160","05:51,320","\"Okay, it's kind of all the way to the top and you have to like wall jump up the building and it takes fucking forever\""]
["05:51,320","05:54,240","\"And then the helicopter is at the top horrible and Cory was like\""]
["05:54,240","05:58,920","\"I don't know this game kind of sucks and he got to the top and a missile hit him square in the face the moment\""]
["05:58,920","06:04,420","\"His feet touch the top and it knocked him like 20 and gave miles off the top of the building and the fucking scream\""]
["06:04,420","06:10,680","\"I'm gonna say this this this part. This is one of those situations where you can beat the final boss like right away\""]
["06:10,680","06:12,680","\"So if Dave loses he stinks\""]
["06:12,680","06:16,680","\"Yes, okay first try\""]
["06:16,680","06:18,680","\"I\""]
["06:18,680","06:22,520","\"Could try come on, baby. You can do it. I can\""]
["06:22,520","06:28,640","\"Also that weird throat room demon has a lot of potential\""]
["06:28,640","06:35,920","\"Cory what do you think of bosses that are just dude sitting in chairs like\""]
["06:35,920","06:44,260","\"Just one in Kingdom Hearts is my final fantasy 15 and now here. I like how nonchalantly he's tossing like fuck you fireballs\""]
["06:44,260","06:49,640","\"And just not really he's not really hey, it's pretty neat. I don't know. Yeah, it's really cool\""]
["06:49,640","06:54,780","\"Jeff yeah, hello, why would you say is your favorite\""]
["06:54,780","07:00,920","\"aesthetic in this screen right now my favorite aesthetic in the screen I\""]
["07:00,920","07:04,140","\"Just like the fact that the guys like face palm and he's so bored\""]
["07:08,660","07:12,460","\"Lay love how so disinterested he is. Is this the first boss?\""]
["07:12,460","07:14,920","\"You'll sort of kind of oh my god\""]
["07:14,920","07:18,600","\"It's supposed to be like a sequence that you can't beat but Jeff just dared me to beat it\""]
["07:18,600","07:21,100","\"So now I have to this is like back, and I know he's losing\""]
["07:21,100","07:27,340","\"There's a thing about double my cry. I would lose that. Did you ever beat this Jeff? No, you suck\""]
["07:27,340","07:33,520","\"Well, I only played through the game once you've already brown brown out you literally only nicked off like\""]
["07:33,520","07:38,040","\"0.3% of the watch I'm gonna kill him as soon as this ends alright, so basically\""]
["07:38,040","07:41,080","\"- Basically, Devil May Cry,\""]
["07:41,080","07:43,560","\"it's the weirdest gaming experience ever.\""]
["07:43,560","07:44,720","\"I can't even explain it.\""]
["07:44,720","07:46,200","\"You just kinda go on autopilot\""]
["07:46,200","07:47,800","\"and you just let the game play itself,\""]
["07:47,800","07:49,020","\"and it's just like a light show.\""]
["07:49,020","07:50,440","\"You don't even know what you're doing at the time.\""]
["07:50,440","07:52,200","\"You're just switching buttons, you're going from--\""]
["07:52,200","07:53,640","\"- I mean, boy, I'll just tell you that.\""]
["07:53,640","07:55,140","\"- I don't think that's a lot of people do that.\""]
["07:55,140","07:55,980","\"- No, it is!\""]
["07:55,980","07:57,440","\"That's how I play it.\""]
["07:57,440","07:59,420","\"I'm just like, my brain is turned off.\""]
["07:59,420","08:01,580","\"I'm literally like, gone.\""]
["08:01,580","08:03,480","\"- That's a muscle memory.\""]
["08:03,480","08:05,280","\"- Oh, you're winning, you're doing it.\""]
["08:05,280","08:06,280","\"- Oh, man. - That's almost done.\""]
["08:06,280","08:07,120","\"- First try, no hits.\""]
["08:07,120","08:09,120","\"Maybe he just let him kill you.\""]
["08:09,120","08:11,120","\"No, Jeff, I got this.\""]
["08:11,120","08:13,120","\"You're all powered up, Jeff.\""]
["08:13,120","08:14,120","\"It's not fair.\""]
["08:14,120","08:15,120","\"Oh my god.\""]
["08:15,120","08:16,120","\"Whatever.\""]
["08:16,120","08:18,120","\"Jeff, you look like a complete fucking asshole now.\""]
["08:18,120","08:20,120","\"No, Dave's cheating anyway.\""]
["08:20,120","08:22,120","\"He basically invented it.\""]
["08:22,120","08:25,120","\"Jeff, you said we should play with all the end game powers, so that's all I know.\""]
["08:25,120","08:27,120","\"Yeah, we were not going to do that, and then Jeff forced us to do it.\""]
["08:27,120","08:28,120","\"But it's like it take...\""]
["08:28,120","08:29,120","\"Oh man.\""]
["08:29,120","08:30,120","\"Yeah.\""]

["08:32,120","08:34,120","\"By the way, what difficulty is this?\""]
["08:34,120","08:36,120","\"This is normal.\""]
["08:36,120","08:42,440","\"Mmm, baby. Yeah, I'm just taking it all back then. Okay, fine. Okay fine. There's a point. It's kind of gay\""]
["08:42,440","08:48,440","\"Dave do don't they must die? No, I'm not actually stopped playing after that because I just got tired of it\""]
["08:48,440","08:50,440","\"I beat the game seven times\""]
["08:50,440","08:52,440","\"Oh, you just got tired of it also tired of it\""]
["08:52,440","09:00,520","\"I had earned like three million souls and I was spending all of them to like fucking buy continues in the game\""]
["09:00,520","09:05,720","\"So there we go. You get the first boss now the game says alright good job game over and we get the credits because we weren't\""]
["09:05,720","09:07,720","\"Wait, really? Oh, you beat the game.\""]
["09:07,720","09:09,720","\"That's supposed to be the end boss and you're supposed to die.\""]
["09:09,720","09:10,720","\"I was gonna play through it.\""]
["09:10,720","09:12,720","\"I have the end powers, so you beat him.\""]
["09:12,720","09:14,720","\"Oh, Jeff is too stupid to ever do that.\""]
["09:14,720","09:16,720","\"Sorry, Jeff.\""]
