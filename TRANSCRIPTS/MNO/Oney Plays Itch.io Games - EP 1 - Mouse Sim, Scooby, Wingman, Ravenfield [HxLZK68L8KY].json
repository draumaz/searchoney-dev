["16:34,720","16:39,360","\"If she falls, I just hurt you you know that this game is not programmed well enough for that to happen\""]
["16:39,360","16:41,700","\"She looks so mitt. She looks so mad\""]
["16:41,700","16:44,700","\"Can you wake the cat up at all I wonder?\""]

["17:30,700","17:35,420","\"It was the happiest day of this. Does tell you the objectives at all check for updates\""]
["17:35,420","17:43,380","\"The objective is to check for updates. I can pee and I wonder if you'll get an email notification every time this game is updated\""]
["17:43,380","17:45,380","\"Which I assume will be often\""]
["17:45,380","17:49,060","\"So I think the goal has to be that you make her step in every oh you can hide you there by the way\""]
["17:49,060","17:53,620","\"Just realized are you invincible when you're in the go cannot be you fuck with the cat?\""]
["17:53,620","17:56,580","\"I feel like a confort and wake the cat up. Maybe yeah\""]
["17:56,580","17:59,660","\"I was gonna say follow your piss and take the cat wake up when a puke on the cat\""]
["17:59,660","18:03,820","\"I was gonna say though the objective can't be to make her step on the rat traps because\""]
["18:03,820","18:09,460","\"Some of those are the tables and shit. Oh, I think I know what to do also. That took away my fucking health\""]
["18:09,460","18:16,020","\"You're pooping. Yeah, I thought that was magic up there. I think by her stepping on the rat traps. I can eat the cheese. I\""]
["18:16,020","18:20,260","\"Think I think that's the whole point. What about the one at the table though\""]
["18:20,260","18:23,940","\"and so what the the point is the game is to poop is that\""]
["18:25,580","18:30,760","\"There's a hunting screw that is actually like a horror that she sounds like somebody be killed with a hammer\""]
["18:30,760","18:32,760","\"It's very genuine like blood-curdling scream\""]
["18:32,760","18:41,920","\"Bet actual money that that scream is taken from something else or that it's you know like that was not recorded for this game\""]
["18:41,920","18:48,280","\"That is seriously hard the of that kidding come at me a big bitch. I'm a little meows. She slipped on your peepee\""]
["18:48,280","18:53,140","\"Fallen that oh god. She didn't get that one. Oh my god. She sprays and walks\""]
