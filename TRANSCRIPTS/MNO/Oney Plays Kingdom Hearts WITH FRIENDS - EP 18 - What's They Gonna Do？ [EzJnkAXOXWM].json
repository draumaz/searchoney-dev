["02:18,920","02:23,680","\"It's it's it's so much odds against it. It's such a big game anyway\""]
["02:23,680","02:29,680","\"Yeah, there's no way you're gonna be able to they got the director of Advent children who that's not a good movie\""]

["05:42,620","05:48,780","\"13 was such a garbage. I I don't expect people who are involved with that to really do something good for seven\""]
["05:48,780","05:50,380","\"Ha\""]
["05:50,380","05:54,740","\"But do you think kids who watch that movie now think it's a ghost instead with genie?\""]
["05:54,740","06:02,660","\"No, well, maybe I don't know he says I think genie's in fiction have kind of disappeared because Robin Williams is dead all that to you\""]
["06:02,660","06:06,000","\"Oh, you were making a joke. I see I\""]
["06:06,000","06:13,040","\"I felt bad about that just because Robin Williams has done a lot and everyone was just like he was a genie\""]
["06:13,040","06:19,320","\"He didn't even want that movie advertised with his name on it. That's true. Why not because they didn't they shafted him\""]

["06:35,940","06:39,660","\"Yeah, all the posters and everything they went completely against what he requested\""]
["06:39,660","06:42,180","\"So he got really upset about it\""]
["06:42,180","06:47,340","\"Which is why he didn't ever reprise his role after that. Wow for the sequels\""]
["06:47,340","06:51,460","\"He came back in the third one. Did he? Yeah, okay. Why did he?\""]
["06:51,460","06:55,020","\"Isn't he Pam? So Homer Simpson wouldn't I do it? I thought\""]

["07:39,220","07:40,820","\"Never mind\""]
["07:40,820","07:45,740","\"Probably yeah, what's they gonna do? What's they gonna do about it? Oh?\""]
["07:45,740","07:48,620","\"Look, it's a lot of these dying\""]
["07:50,460","07:53,340","\"Gorsh still again. He's being hacked up by those Arabs\""]
["07:53,340","07:59,200","\"He is an Arab press. Yes true. Well, then why isn't he wearing a turban and have a sword?\""]
["07:59,200","08:03,760","\"That is a nice final fantasy Santa Fe\""]
["08:03,760","08:06,860","\"That's Homer\""]
["08:06,860","08:15,740","\"What if genie said\""]
["08:15,740","08:30,780","\"said, what if Homer said, you would die. What if Robin Williams said, you're by\""]
["08:30,780","08:37,900","\"precious darling, and he's talking about the video game Zelda and not his daughter. I\""]

["08:56,900","08:58,900","\"Because I'm crazy.\""]
["08:58,900","09:03,900","\"Did he hold his middle finger?\""]
["09:03,900","09:05,900","\"Oh, he always has four.\""]
