["00:19,680","00:21,280","\"\"\"Parodious\"\"\""]
["00:21,280","00:24,560","\"\"\"I would say, uh, Final Fantasy 12?\"\"\""]
["00:24,560","00:26,720","\"\"\"I actually really like that game.\"\"\""]
["00:26,720","00:27,680","\"\"\"I hate that game.\"\"\""]

["00:55,520","00:57,520","\"You can't put mashed potatoes between their toes\""]
["00:57,520","00:58,360","\"- There you go.\""]
["00:58,360","01:01,400","\"- Why are you so obsessed with that today?\""]
["01:01,400","01:02,880","\"- 'Cause it's funny.\""]
["01:02,880","01:05,160","\"Chris, you know it's funny.\""]
["01:05,160","01:06,000","\"That's funny.\""]
["01:06,000","01:08,200","\"- Just mix it up, start using other foods.\""]
["01:08,200","01:09,280","\"Do you feel like great del--\""]
["01:09,280","01:11,880","\"- There's the kid on YouTube we found,\""]
["01:11,880","01:14,520","\"who did all the videos and from the green screen\""]
["01:14,520","01:17,880","\"where he was making himself into a giant.\""]
["01:17,880","01:20,120","\"- And stepping on his friend over and over and over.\""]
["01:20,120","01:22,400","\"- We saw the one video and Julian just said like,\""]
["01:22,400","01:24,400","\"okay, this is probably a fetish video.\""]
["01:24,400","01:25,400","\"- And you guys didn't believe me.\""]
["01:25,400","01:28,640","\"Well, I believed you, but I said only if he did more than one.\""]
["01:28,640","01:29,480","\"- Fucking God.\""]
["01:29,480","01:30,880","\"- And then we found his channel, and surely enough,\""]
["01:30,880","01:34,060","\"he has a playlist of like 20 videos of him doing it.\""]
["01:34,060","01:36,400","\"I'm sure his friends had no idea what it was for.\""]
["01:36,400","01:39,400","\"- I don't know if he even knew what it was for.\""]
["01:39,400","01:40,240","\"He was so young.\""]
["01:40,240","01:41,080","\"- It's true.\""]
["01:41,080","01:42,640","\"- He probably doesn't understand what the feelings are.\""]
["01:42,640","01:44,440","\"- Ha ha, come over, it'll be fun.\""]
["01:44,440","01:46,560","\"And this one, you get stuck between my toes\""]
["01:46,560","01:51,560","\"and then this one, I twirl you around on my tongue.\""]
["01:51,560","01:53,760","\"And this one, I pin you against a wall,\""]
["01:53,760","01:55,040","\"I sit down on you.\""]
["01:55,040","01:57,040","\"This one you come on me\""]

["02:24,240","02:26,840","\"I'm small enough for your urethra\""]
["02:26,840","02:30,680","\"Blinked it out of my urethra\""]
["02:30,680","02:39,080","\"He's laughing about it. The crabs don't even have urethra. It's what they used to do when they were kids. He would say like urethra\""]
["02:39,080","02:46,120","\"Urethra, because he always a spatula. Oh my god. If they were friends, they probably would do stuff like that when they're younger\""]
["02:46,120","02:53,100","\"Experimenting. It's an award. You're urethra smells terrible. It's the crab\""]
["02:53,100","02:55,500","\"- The Krabby Patty secret urethra.\""]
["02:55,500","02:57,500","\"- The Krabby Patty secret urethra.\""]
["02:57,500","03:01,140","\"- Every Krabby Patty has a few flakes of skin\""]
["03:01,140","03:02,480","\"from his urethra.\""]
["03:02,480","03:03,740","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:03,740","03:04,940","\"That's what makes it taste so good.\""]

["03:41,980","03:44,780","\"- I thought, wasn't that an episode?\""]
["03:44,780","03:45,620","\"- Yeah.\""]

["03:50,540","03:51,380","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:51,380","03:55,380","\"I don't like it. You have SpongeBob, but I have a big big star man.\""]

["04:05,380","04:09,380","\"Says, you know, these used to be one.\""]
["04:09,380","04:12,380","\"That's a gross. It's funny. It's a poopy pee pee joke.\""]
["04:12,380","04:17,380","\"I wish to his little brand stain right in his bum bum.\""]
["04:17,380","04:20,380","\"Are they allowed to show poop?\""]
["04:20,380","04:21,380","\"I don't think so.\""]
["04:21,380","04:24,380","\"Uh, no, but they're allowed to show pulsating veins now.\""]
["04:24,380","04:27,380","\"Is that what they had to call it, \"\"Numa Sludge\"\"?\""]
["04:27,380","04:28,380","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["04:28,380","04:29,380","\"Numa sludge.\""]
["04:29,380","04:31,380","\"Is that the beach they're on all the time?\""]
["04:31,380","04:32,380","\"It's just full of shit.\""]
["04:32,380","04:34,380","\"We love that backdrop.\""]
["04:34,380","04:35,380","\"The backdrop's so cool.\""]
["04:35,380","04:38,380","\"I can fall asleep to that backdrop and have horrible nightmares.\""]
["04:38,380","04:40,380","\"[laughter]\""]
["04:40,380","04:43,380","\"What if it means face to start appearing in this little dot?\""]
["04:43,380","04:46,380","\"It's like, as in \"\"In Each Little Dot\"\" is his face.\""]
["04:46,380","04:47,380","\"[laughter]\""]
["04:47,380","04:49,380","\"You just see a bunch of browned black.\""]
["04:49,380","04:52,380","\"I was imagining him taking up the whole background.\""]
["04:52,380","04:57,380","\"I mean this back from Bugs me because it's a giant cylinder that you're trapped inside of.\""]
["04:57,380","05:00,380","\"It's like the Drownhouse in 64.\""]
["05:00,380","05:02,380","\"Oh yeah, I love the Drownhouse.\""]
["05:02,380","05:03,380","\"How do you get here?\""]
["05:03,380","05:04,380","\"The Drownhouse.\""]
["05:04,380","05:05,380","\"I like that we call it the Drownhouse.\""]
["05:05,380","05:07,380","\"I think it's really good for it.\""]
["05:07,380","05:09,380","\"That's the name of it on the Mario wiki.\""]
["05:09,380","05:10,380","\"Is it really?\""]
["05:10,380","05:11,380","\"No.\""]
["05:11,380","05:13,380","\"It should be the Drownhouse.\""]
["05:13,380","05:14,380","\"You're that viewer.\""]
["05:14,380","05:15,380","\"It's up to you to change that.\""]
["05:15,380","05:17,380","\"Making it a part of history.\""]
["05:17,380","05:18,680","\"The same thing they did with Jackie Chan\""]
["05:18,680","05:20,920","\"make a whole bunch of bad things.\""]
["05:20,920","05:23,880","\"God, this fucking stresses me out.\""]
["05:23,880","05:25,180","\"Oh my God. - I love this shit.\""]
["05:25,180","05:26,680","\"- It's okay, Julian, I'm really good.\""]
["05:26,680","05:27,980","\"- The stuff is fun. - The past 30 minutes\""]
["05:27,980","05:29,080","\"I've been really good.\""]
["05:29,080","05:33,740","\"- Oh, he jumped. - I mean, it seems like\""]
["05:33,740","05:35,180","\"you're doing great on these.\""]
["05:35,180","05:39,300","\"'Cause I can't talk.\""]
["05:39,300","05:41,500","\"- Mario ran by the blue thing.\""]
["05:41,500","05:42,700","\"- And then the orange thing.\""]
["05:42,700","05:44,900","\"- Firmly on the floor.\""]
["05:44,900","05:46,240","\"- This is my fan story.\""]
["05:46,240","05:49,600","\"It's called the time I played Mario Sunshine.\""]
["05:49,600","05:52,880","\"Then he walked past the blue thing and did a jump.\""]
["05:52,880","05:54,520","\"- He did a slip off. - He almost fell,\""]
["05:54,520","05:56,880","\"but he got to end and collect shine.\""]
["05:56,880","05:59,400","\"Mother came into room and said dinner ready.\""]
["05:59,400","06:00,580","\"I said not yet.\""]
["06:00,580","06:04,520","\"- Mom, I can't save yet, but really I could save.\""]
["06:04,520","06:07,760","\"- She said time for bed.\""]
["06:07,760","06:11,040","\"I put the GameCube under my bed with the TV.\""]
["06:11,040","06:12,360","\"It was a secret.\""]
["06:12,360","06:14,560","\"- Mm-hmm, he went to Disneyland.\""]
["06:14,560","06:15,400","\"- How was it?\""]
["06:15,400","06:20,440","\"Uh, it was actually a very good day. It was not crowded. The weather was nice.\""]
["06:20,440","06:23,620","\"The worst thing that happened was that we, uh,\""]
["06:23,620","06:29,080","\"the haunted mansion, they intentionally kept us inside for 10 minutes despite no one being in line.\""]
["06:29,080","06:33,020","\"Because the park was about to close and they didn't want us to go on another ride.\""]
["06:33,020","06:39,200","\"We had a fast pass for Indiana Jones and we were one minute over, just one minute over.\""]
["06:39,200","06:42,560","\"Like it just turned 1201, or 1101.\""]
["06:42,560","06:50,920","\"And the guy said, \"\"Oh Noah, sorry, we can't let anyone else on.\"\" He lied. He lied. He was so sad.\""]
["06:50,920","07:11,080","\"He lied. Snowball went to heaven. He died. I'm glad you knew what I was saying, Chris. Why? Why is my cat dead? Why couldn't that haunted me? Why is it dead? Why did my friend... I've never... I've ever had a Lisa Simpson toy and stepped on her head by accident.\""]
["07:11,080","07:15,960","\"Everything what it hurts. That's a relatable thing. Yes, it is\""]
["07:15,960","07:21,800","\"Did you ever have a little brother eight years old exactly and then you've put a Lisa Simpson toy on the floor\""]
["07:21,800","07:27,360","\"And then you would step on it and it would cut your foot open and it would bleed and you look for band-aids and there were no band-aids\""]
["07:27,360","07:29,360","\"I'm minor something\""]
["07:29,360","07:35,320","\"Yeah, they use those where did you even find a Lisa Simpson? They use those in war zones. Mom and dad got me Simpson's toys\""]
["07:35,320","07:38,200","\"Why'd you be on the floor?\""]
["07:38,600","07:40,600","\"Fucking kids\""]
["07:40,600","07:46,080","\"I love this I want to do\""]
["07:46,080","07:55,440","\"Watch watch and squirm I like this Yoshi's Island background. Yeah. Oh, it's really nice. It's like crayons\""]
["07:55,440","08:00,920","\"If only they did an HD Yoshi's Island that would like this. Oh, this is scary. Why is it doing this?\""]
["08:00,920","08:06,280","\"Yeah, have fun Chris fuck. Okay, Chris. Do you see the path? No, okay go\""]
["08:07,960","08:14,280","\"My god, oh remember you can dive forward, but if you're coming out of it\""]
["08:14,280","08:23,240","\"Well if the tech said you're not very good ha ha ha ha I would like that I wish games were meaner\""]
["08:23,240","08:32,260","\"You don't need the snap out of the dive\""]
["08:32,260","08:36,200","\"Mario I wish they kept the long\""]
["08:37,360","08:38,200","\"- Mariam.\""]
["08:38,200","08:39,400","\"- I love the long jump.\""]
["08:39,400","08:41,680","\"You could steer it really easy too.\""]
["08:41,680","08:43,040","\"- Why didn't you just feel good to play?\""]
["08:43,040","08:46,380","\"- Yeah, did they ever change the controls from Mario 64?\""]
["08:46,380","08:49,280","\"- Well, this is the point that they cut a little bit of it back,\""]
["08:49,280","08:51,220","\"but they gave you the flood for movement options.\""]
["08:51,220","08:53,060","\"But after this, they did galaxy,\""]
["08:53,060","08:55,020","\"and that's when they started really cutting down on movement.\""]
["08:55,020","08:55,860","\"- Thank you.\""]
["08:55,860","08:57,560","\"They gave you a long jump in the galaxy, right?\""]
["08:57,560","08:58,400","\"- Whoa.\""]
["08:58,400","08:59,880","\"They gave you the spin in the air too,\""]
["08:59,880","09:02,640","\"but they were starting to cut back a movement.\""]
["09:02,640","09:07,040","\"And then they did 3D, which was cutting back too.\""]
["09:07,040","09:12,660","\"Isn't physics this is stupid. What the fuck?\""]
["09:12,660","09:20,340","\"Nothing we're talking about pressing B over no really you're gonna have to do it here really so you dive on your belly\""]
["09:20,340","09:22,340","\"You keep pressing B\""]
["09:22,340","09:27,640","\"No, yeah, that works to yeah, that works too. But watch out for the corner on the on the other one\""]
["09:27,640","09:29,640","\"There you go, cuz that's gonna disappear\""]
["09:29,640","09:34,320","\"Don't go for life by the way. It's not me so Jar Jar bank, dude. He says\""]
["09:35,320","09:40,660","\"He did see that piece of that piece of jar charge like toy that had like a candy tongue when you suck on it. Yes\""]
["09:40,660","09:44,580","\"Good idea\""]
["09:44,580","09:56,920","\"Thank God for letting me do it. I like those levels. I don't like the flood levels\""]
["09:56,920","09:59,680","\"You don't like 90% of the game. Yeah\""]
["09:59,680","10:05,180","\"If the game was all this I'd love it, you know what what that actually would be a lot of fun\""]
["10:05,180","10:11,900","\"If they did, if they just took Mario 64 and made like 500 of those to play, that'd be really fun.\""]
["10:11,900","10:13,900","\"And if they brought back the slide jump and shit?\""]
["10:13,900","10:17,180","\"Because Mario 64 doesn't really have that many linear levels in it.\""]
["10:17,180","10:18,380","\"The Bowser stages.\""]
["10:18,380","10:21,900","\"You know, I don't really like exploring in Mario games. I like platforming.\""]
["10:21,900","10:26,460","\"I like exploring because Mario 64 can come up with, because people say it has no replay value,\""]
["10:26,460","10:29,100","\"but I love coming up with new shortcuts and everything.\""]
["10:29,100","10:29,420","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["10:29,420","10:30,460","\"That's a lot of fun to get back to.\""]
["10:30,460","10:34,620","\"That's not what I mean by exploring. I mean, like, I don't care about the game world as a story point.\""]
["10:34,620","10:39,140","\"What I will say is I'd still much rather have something that controlled like 64 again.\""]
