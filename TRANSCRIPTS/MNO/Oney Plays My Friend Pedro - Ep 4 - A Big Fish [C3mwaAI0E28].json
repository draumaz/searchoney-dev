["07:25,800","07:31,120","\"I was kind of waiting for anybody else to pick up on it, but oh good point weirdly enough. Nobody did\""]
["07:31,120","07:35,740","\"Yeah, this day. I don't know that you've ever hired a new editor that didn't have a name ending an aisle\""]
["07:35,740","07:41,060","\"We haven't there you go. Yeah job. Oh, I think pretty fresh\""]
["07:41,060","07:46,820","\"There's an open offer if there's a miles out there. We'll take a miles editor. Yeah, it's a little bit of a stretch\""]

["07:49,920","07:52,480","\"guile I\""]
["07:52,480","07:57,360","\"Mean if there's really a human being named guile if there's someone named after the Street Fighter guy\""]

["08:02,460","08:06,460","\"I guess that'd be fine too as long as you went by it colloquially like yeah\""]

["08:22,620","08:24,940","\"fuck\""]
["08:24,940","08:30,860","\"There really is no more aisles. I just went through the whole alphabet. I was yeah that that was why I went weirdly silent\""]
["08:30,860","08:35,500","\"My eyes glazed. I was trying really hard. No other reason miles is the closest. Oh\""]
["08:35,500","08:38,780","\"But it doesn't count\""]
["08:38,780","08:41,780","\"If there's a guy called miles if they're fuck you you'll never make it\""]
["08:41,780","08:49,660","\"That's kind of mean. I kind of wish I was called miles per hour, you know, and there's also the name Niles like from Frasier. Oh\""]
["08:51,140","08:57,200","\"Okay, I did not know that that wasn't gonna kill me. Oh, okay. Well, it didn't I knew that was game\""]
["08:57,200","09:01,400","\"You see the episode of Fraser where he takes off his shoes and he starts clapping his feet together and going\""]
["09:01,400","09:08,680","\"He forced honey all over his feet starts sucking on his toes. Yeah, that's all this. Yeah, you're lying\""]
["09:08,680","09:14,460","\"It's a good episode. This is the best I would go as far as to say his brothers like my brothers were told\""]
["09:14,460","09:19,240","\"This is the second time today. I've heard you mention a honey on feet. It's just my thing\""]
["09:20,080","09:27,080","\"Chris is having a very foot oriented day. Give him a break. Yeah, that's true. Chris you probably should stop soaking it by the way\""]
["09:27,080","09:29,880","\"Really? It's been over a half hour. Yeah, it's gonna fall off now\""]
["09:29,880","09:33,360","\"I mean you just don't want to over soak it. It's gonna like\""]

["09:36,760","09:40,600","\"Tomar if you were my dad, I think you might actually disown\""]
["09:40,600","09:48,560","\"Why? I'm such a fucking asshole. You probably called Tomar daddy more than your actual father. I call my daddy dad\""]
["09:48,760","09:55,320","\"Yeah, exactly. That's what I meant actually I call a pop-a a lot. I've never called anybody daddy and I'm not about to start\""]
["09:55,320","09:58,540","\"I stopped calling my daddy daddy when I was like seven\""]
["09:58,540","10:03,560","\"Do you think if you confronted your dad with that information Chris like if you said hey dad\""]
["10:03,560","10:05,060","\"One of my friends\""]
["10:05,060","10:09,660","\"I've just taken to calling daddy and I've probably called him daddy more times than I have you\""]
["10:09,660","10:11,860","\"Do you think you would get dad jealous?\""]
["10:11,860","10:15,300","\"I wouldn't admit it, but he would\""]
["10:17,660","10:21,540","\"My dad wouldn't get jealous. He'd just be like that's weird Chris. He's a cool guy\""]
["10:21,540","10:26,900","\"He would get the joke. But if he would be down he would be really sad. He wouldn't you don't know my father\""]
["10:26,900","10:32,820","\"I think I know I think I know some dads. You know my dad used to be really really cool at basketball\""]

["11:00,220","11:06,180","\"I'm a little like defensive about any information that you give about your heritage or family because of the steamroller story\""]
["11:06,180","11:11,540","\"I was genuinely like kind of gauging that one out. I'm like, okay, where's it go with this?\""]
["11:11,540","11:16,060","\"It was just a regular story about like slipping discs and basketball.\""]

["11:17,060","11:18,820","\"You got me.\""]
["11:18,820","11:23,620","\"I think there was some bit of like plot information that I skipped through from that falling guy\""]
["11:23,620","11:25,260","\"about who I might be.\""]
["11:25,260","11:26,980","\"But maybe not.\""]
