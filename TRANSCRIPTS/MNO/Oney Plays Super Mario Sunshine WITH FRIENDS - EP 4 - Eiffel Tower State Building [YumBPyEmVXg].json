["02:58,560","03:01,560","\"What's the worst penny smasher you ever got?\""]
["03:01,560","03:10,560","\"Uh, Jesus. I stopped doing them after a while because I realized like, oh every time I bring back one as a souvenir I would always get it lost.\""]
["03:10,560","03:11,560","\"Yeah, because it's a penny.\""]
["03:11,560","03:12,560","\"Yeah.\""]

["03:54,100","03:56,940","\"They would pop only wooden their copper\""]
["03:56,940","04:00,420","\"Even if you put a hole in it it wouldn't float though, would it?\""]
["04:00,420","04:06,160","\"I don't know we're making up physics. It would just be a fucking ball of copper with\""]
["04:06,160","04:10,980","\"Erinsize you playing catch with someone they catch because it's strong enough and then you're like you're looking the other way\""]
["04:10,980","04:16,460","\"And just crave half your head in the minutes. Well it'd be full of like it would be way as much as a penny\""]

["04:55,860","04:57,860","\"That was one part of the movie that I didn't like.\""]
["04:57,860","04:58,860","\"I thought that was silly.\""]
["04:58,860","05:02,860","\"You know what the four bases of the Eiffel Tower represent?\""]

["06:14,740","06:16,740","\"Exactly, all he did was explode.\""]
["06:16,740","06:21,740","\"I mean that's what you would do is if you already wasted your recovery movie, you could just keep throwing grenades at yourself.\""]
["06:21,740","06:24,740","\"You couldn't die, he was too heavy.\""]

["07:48,120","07:52,400","\"Yeah, so there's train tracks. That's your life also adjust the camera when you need to\""]
["07:52,400","07:55,440","\"Because it can get a little bit confusing\""]
["07:59,280","08:01,280","\"I'll try one more time\""]

["08:15,440","08:20,600","\"Like an eighth of a second, but still it's like it's probably like two frames or something\""]
["08:20,600","08:23,640","\"There's a little bit of a delay on it, so it makes it hard to\""]
["08:23,640","08:26,480","\"- You get used to doing that.\""]
["08:26,480","08:27,640","\"- You get used to doing that.\""]

["08:42,400","08:43,560","\"- Oh, did he review that?\""]
["08:43,560","08:46,320","\"- He did, he talked about Mario Sunshine,\""]
["08:46,320","08:49,040","\"and he was saying he hates the soundtrack\""]
["08:49,040","08:50,600","\"'cause he thinks it's obnoxious.\""]
["08:50,600","08:52,200","\"- There are parts worth obnoxious.\""]
["08:52,200","08:55,920","\"That was when we tried to record Twin Sanity earlier today,\""]
["08:55,920","08:58,400","\"and we found out it doesn't work on PS3s.\""]
["08:58,400","09:00,920","\"- Yeah, it has a weird emulation thing where\""]
["09:00,920","09:02,560","\"everyone has a fog of water.\""]
["09:02,560","09:04,160","\"- Oh, not even that, we couldn't get past.\""]

["09:18,720","09:19,560","\"- The music's good.\""]
["09:19,560","09:21,040","\"- And it made me sad.\""]
["09:21,040","09:23,380","\"'Cause I really like the Twin Sandity soundtrack.\""]
["09:23,380","09:24,620","\"- The Twin Sandity soundtrack's good,\""]
["09:24,620","09:26,660","\"but it is jarring from the usual music.\""]
["09:26,660","09:28,660","\"It's probably a bit obnoxious for old fans.\""]
["09:28,660","09:29,500","\"- It's a fun though.\""]
["09:29,500","09:31,100","\"- It's better than like fucking Rat the Cortex,\""]
["09:31,100","09:32,500","\"we just like remixed everything.\""]
["09:32,500","09:33,860","\"- Oh yeah, Rat the Cortex is no fun.\""]
["09:33,860","09:35,780","\"- That had a fucking awful soundtrack.\""]
["09:35,780","09:37,700","\"- It sounds like the Rascal soundtrack.\""]
["09:37,700","09:39,060","\"- I like the Castle music.\""]
["09:39,060","09:41,300","\"That's the only, like when it's the medieval music\""]
["09:41,300","09:43,140","\"and it sounds really quirky.\""]
