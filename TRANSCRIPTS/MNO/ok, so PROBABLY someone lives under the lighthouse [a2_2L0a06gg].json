["14:20,200","14:22,360","\"Why would it make you do that though?\""]
["14:22,360","14:24,000","\"I guess he didn't just clip it.\""]
["14:24,000","14:25,920","\"He also stole it.\""]
["14:25,920","14:27,360","\"He stole the sand.\""]
["14:27,360","14:31,120","\"So maybe you have to just go down and steal the sandbags.\""]
["14:31,120","14:34,200","\"Yeah, fucking--\""]
["14:34,200","14:35,200","\"Are you eating them?\""]
["14:35,200","14:36,200","\"I think so.\""]
["14:36,200","14:39,720","\"Don't eat sand, Tomar.\""]
["14:39,720","14:42,280","\"Tomar, stop.\""]
["14:42,280","14:43,760","\"Please, why he's doing it?\""]
["14:43,760","14:49,360","\"Maybe he craves sandbag. Yum yum yum, I am hungry for sand.\""]
["14:49,360","14:52,100","\"It feels my belly so hard.\""]
["14:52,100","14:55,080","\"What the fuck has happened?\""]
["14:55,080","14:57,160","\"Yeah, you gotta cake the walls with it now.\""]
["14:57,160","15:01,080","\"Cake the wall to it lots of sand.\""]
["15:01,080","15:03,000","\"Fa la la la la la la la.\""]
["15:03,000","15:05,480","\"Shoot it from your frontal gland.\""]
["15:05,480","15:10,040","\"Oh, I can go in here.\""]
["15:10,040","15:12,120","\"Go Thomas.\""]
["15:12,120","15:17,120","\"Okay, now we're...\""]
["15:17,120","15:20,120","\"You're on the wall going down the ladder.\""]
["15:20,120","15:21,120","\"That's where you came from?\""]
["15:21,120","15:23,120","\"Oh, I see.\""]
["15:23,120","15:25,120","\"Tarzan, oh I see.\""]
["15:25,120","15:30,120","\"Whoa.\""]
["15:30,120","15:35,120","\"(laughs)\""]
["15:35,120","15:37,120","\"That's kind of scary looking.\""]
["15:37,120","15:38,120","\"I like that.\""]
["15:38,120","15:41,120","\"Yeah, that's very like Silent Hill.\""]
["15:41,120","15:45,120","\"Ooh, you are the mothman.\""]
["15:45,120","15:49,120","\"It's like a weird larval stage.\""]
["15:49,120","15:52,120","\"Oh, now you gotta fucking chase that dude, right?\""]
["15:52,120","15:53,120","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:53,120","15:55,120","\"[laughs]\""]
["15:55,120","15:57,120","\"[sighs]\""]
["15:57,120","16:02,120","\"So now you're playing this from the other perspective?\""]
["16:02,120","16:03,120","\"Yeah.\""]
["16:03,120","16:05,120","\"Now you truly are controlling it.\""]
["16:05,120","16:31,800","\"I mean, you could open the other doors.\""]
["16:31,800","16:34,080","\"I feel like I've heard that sound before.\""]
["16:34,080","16:36,160","\"The sound effect of the scary chase.\""]
["16:36,160","16:40,160","\"It's gonna drive me crazy thinking about it.\""]
["16:40,160","16:42,740","\"(upbeat music)\""]
["16:42,740","16:55,560","\"I love the style of this game though.\""]
["16:55,560","16:59,120","\"What is this giant blowing light?\""]
["16:59,120","17:00,520","\"Go to words and you'll find out.\""]
["17:00,520","17:02,760","\"Sounds like something a moth would want.\""]
["17:02,760","17:05,000","\"Sounds like something a moth would say.\""]
["17:05,000","17:05,840","\"Probably.\""]
["17:05,840","17:07,600","\"Oh, look at this sphincter.\""]
["17:07,600","17:09,380","\"Oh, it's the moth's meat hole.\""]
["17:09,380","17:13,720","\"(laughs)\""]
["17:13,720","17:15,320","\"Was that there the whole time?\""]
["17:15,320","17:16,140","\"I don't know.\""]
["17:16,140","17:18,400","\"That's what Barry made those like holes?\""]
["17:18,400","17:19,400","\"What?\""]
["17:19,400","17:21,400","\"This is your like little moth meat hole\""]
["17:21,400","17:24,480","\"that you sleep in and you suck your thumb in,\""]
["17:24,480","17:28,000","\"you roll around and that kind of stuff.\""]
["17:29,200","17:30,200","\"Yeah, you would.\""]
["17:30,200","17:35,320","\"Looks like good.\""]
["17:35,320","17:36,320","\"It's the beating heart.\""]
["17:36,320","17:38,480","\"It's the heart of the moth.\""]
["17:38,480","17:39,480","\"Still hard.\""]
["17:39,480","17:42,080","\"Please, don't do something about that.\""]
["17:42,080","17:47,520","\"I feel like using this information, maybe you could do better in another playthrough.\""]
["17:47,520","17:48,520","\"I don't know.\""]
["17:48,520","17:50,120","\"You can try to attack the heart.\""]
["17:50,120","17:53,920","\"That's like, I don't know though.\""]
["17:53,920","17:56,920","\"That was literally like a heart underneath the lighthouse.\""]
["17:56,920","17:58,640","\"So the lighthouse is made of meat.\""]
["17:58,640","18:00,840","\"Is that what it's getting at?\""]
["18:00,840","18:03,120","\"- I think this whole thing is just an organism\""]
["18:03,120","18:06,440","\"that traps you and turns you into a moth man.\""]
["18:06,440","18:10,700","\"I guess is part of a, wait, okay,\""]
["18:10,700","18:13,480","\"so you were the original guy.\""]
["18:13,480","18:15,960","\"So this moth is the original guy?\""]
["18:15,960","18:17,320","\"He was the moth?\""]
["18:17,320","18:19,400","\"- Yeah, I think this moth is the first guy,\""]
["18:19,400","18:22,600","\"but there's definitely was another moth that was,\""]
["18:22,600","18:25,640","\"I don't know, it's kind of confusing.\""]
["18:25,640","18:28,480","\"There's something weirdly cyclical.\""]
["18:28,480","18:30,080","\"- Bring him to me. - Bring him to me.\""]
["18:30,080","18:32,720","\"So the moth is trying to bring.\""]
["18:32,720","18:34,640","\"You might have to go back out now.\""]
["18:34,640","18:37,440","\"- Nah, there's a little door right there.\""]
["18:37,440","18:38,280","\"- Is that what that is?\""]
["18:38,280","18:39,120","\"- Yeah.\""]
["18:39,120","18:41,160","\"- Oh wait, wait, is that like a little model\""]
["18:41,160","18:42,520","\"of the lighthouse?\""]
["18:42,520","18:44,080","\"Like is that the door? - There's a door right there.\""]
["18:44,080","18:45,040","\"- Yeah.\""]
["18:45,040","18:46,080","\"Oh, what the fuck?\""]
["18:46,080","18:50,120","\"(water splashing)\""]
["18:50,120","18:54,040","\"Mm.\""]
["18:54,040","18:57,120","\"And there's a disc right there.\""]
["18:57,120","19:00,720","\"Oh yeah, so this is where he ascends the stairs.\""]
["19:00,720","19:09,800","\"The guy comes out when I was looking at the record player, right?\""]
["19:09,800","19:10,800","\"You remembering it.\""]
["19:10,800","19:15,880","\"Tell me, remembering what music was.\""]
["19:15,880","19:17,880","\"remember\""]
["19:17,880","19:28,880","\"What the fuck is your head it's just exposed brains sort of the kind of looks like oh\""]
["19:28,880","19:36,480","\"It's okay take your time it's not like you catch him or anything\""]
["19:36,480","19:56,240","\"thing. There's gotta be a point to this. There's gotta be a reveal. I should be\""]
["19:56,240","20:00,480","\"able to predict exactly where this dude's gonna go. Dude, I'm like genuinely\""]
["20:00,480","20:06,400","\"invested in this. I'm like, that's down. Wait, I hear him. He's behind you. It's\""]
["20:06,400","20:07,800","\"- It sounded like, yeah.\""]
["20:07,800","20:10,740","\"- That did, oh no.\""]
["20:10,740","20:11,820","\"- Oh, there you go.\""]
["20:11,820","20:13,740","\"- You found it.\""]
["20:13,740","20:14,580","\"- Oh.\""]
["20:14,580","20:15,820","\"- Did you just kill him?\""]
["20:15,820","20:16,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["20:16,660","20:22,220","\"- Oh, and then you bring him down into that place.\""]
["20:22,220","20:23,780","\"- No.\""]
["20:23,780","20:24,900","\"It's a moth hell.\""]
["20:24,900","20:28,380","\"- Oh.\""]
["20:28,380","20:31,140","\"(dramatic music)\""]
["20:34,580","20:36,580","\"You're in red land now\""]
["20:36,580","20:45,580","\"Oh it fell over\""]
["20:45,580","20:53,900","\"What the fuck are you can you do something here\""]
["20:53,900","20:58,780","\"Nope, no, I think it's just applying they're sitting there in shock. Oh\""]
["20:58,780","21:02,500","\"That was the assistant or whatever\""]
["21:03,420","21:05,780","\"No one lives under the lighthouse\""]
["21:05,780","21:11,120","\"Wow, what the fuck that was pretty cool that was neat. I\""]
["21:11,120","21:14,900","\"liked it. Thanks, mr. Zubakov\""]
["21:14,900","21:15,860","\"I\""]

["21:17,860","21:26,620","\"Inca Manko I think that was just three guys made that game. Okay good game guys. You did a good one. Yeah, not bad guys, okay\""]
["21:27,660","21:32,020","\"No, it was really good, but um here's a thought for for your next one\""]
["21:32,020","21:38,020","\"Maybe don't make it look like it was so old. Yeah, they thought it like it's new. Yeah, make it look like it's like a new game\""]
["21:38,020","21:40,020","\"Not an old game\""]
["21:40,020","21:42,060","\"Yeah, also\""]
