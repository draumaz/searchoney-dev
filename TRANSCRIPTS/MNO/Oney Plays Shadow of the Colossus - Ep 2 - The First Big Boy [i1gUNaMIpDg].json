["00:10,000","00:13,000","\"Yeah, that body is like way too floppy to be.\""]

["00:14,000","00:15,000","\"*Intro*\""]
["00:15,000","00:18,000","\"It goes rigid, then it goes floppy, then it turns blue.\""]
["00:18,000","00:22,000","\"So he's got a very limited amount of time before it turns blue.\""]
["00:22,000","00:24,000","\"Make up your mind woman.\""]
["00:24,000","00:26,000","\"Once it turns blue, you can't fill it with goo.\""]

["00:28,000","00:34,320","\"You I was thought this game had a really good opening but now I've I realized that it was blinded nostalgia\""]
["00:34,320","00:41,120","\"You were just you were just young and enjoying watching a 3d anime well to be fair. We are actively ruining it\""]
["00:41,120","00:48,520","\"I remember I remember putting into this right I must have skipped this shit\""]
["00:48,520","00:54,120","\"Cuz I remember putting the disc I got on my horse and I found my first colossus and I was like wow that was a great opening I\""]
["00:54,120","00:56,640","\"To be fair I think I skip this too\""]
["00:56,640","01:00,800","\"You can get the plot he puts the girl there. He's obviously here to bring her back\""]
["01:00,800","01:03,420","\"You know what you honestly you just need this shot\""]
["01:03,420","01:09,080","\"This is the only shot you actually need wow. Why do you you run like you're on a mission?\""]
["01:09,080","01:14,900","\"You ran any faster you punch yourself in the face dude look at him look at his arms when you're running\""]
["01:14,900","01:19,160","\"You're like ah they do that that this game is already 30 years old\""]
["01:19,160","01:24,080","\"Can you believe that the Nintendo 64 was a century and a half ago?\""]
["01:24,280","01:31,280","\"You're dead I believe that there is more time now between us and the original Super Mario brothers than there was\""]
["01:31,280","01:32,640","\"Up with that role\""]
["01:32,640","01:36,080","\"Super Mario brothers and the founding fathers establishing America\""]

["01:43,600","01:54,240","\"Yeah, no that roll sucks dick like that like that I mean I guess I guess it makes sense like you your momentum\""]
["01:54,240","01:55,240","\"would kind of slow down.\""]
["01:55,240","01:57,240","\"I'm going to make you big fucking stupid...\""]
["01:57,240","01:58,240","\"Well, I couldn't...\""]
["01:58,240","02:00,160","\"I'm just going to run right over you.\""]
["02:00,160","02:03,360","\"You know Dark Souls was heavily influenced by this game probably.\""]
["02:03,360","02:05,720","\"Damn, your horse's dick is made of metal.\""]
["02:05,720","02:09,120","\"No, he's a good guy.\""]

["02:11,160","02:12,400","\"Well, I didn't mean to do that.\""]
["02:12,400","02:20,240","\"So, uh, Mick, there are no enemies, uh, whatsoever in this game.\""]
["02:20,240","02:23,320","\"When you hunt down the Colossus, it's like this\""]
["02:23,320","02:27,520","\"sort of atmospheric breathing room thing,\""]
["02:27,520","02:31,600","\"which means we get to do a little road trip games\""]
["02:31,600","02:34,200","\"in the meantime 'cause we're fucking--\""]
["02:34,200","02:36,240","\"- It's just a horse riding simulator.\""]
["02:36,240","02:37,720","\"- Kind of. - It is a horse riding.\""]
["02:37,720","02:41,200","\"- It does, if you're playing this alone,\""]
["02:41,200","02:43,880","\"it does pace it out in a really nice way.\""]
["02:43,880","02:46,720","\"I don't know how that'll translate to a let's play.\""]
["02:46,720","02:50,440","\"But if you see a lizard, Chris, fucking kill it.\""]
["02:50,440","02:51,540","\"- Yeah. - Remember that.\""]
["02:51,540","02:52,680","\"- Yeah. - But those are,\""]
["02:52,680","02:55,240","\"those are the only other creatures besides colossi.\""]
["02:55,240","02:56,400","\"- There are lizards there. - You're in the horse.\""]
["02:56,400","02:57,960","\"- There are lizards that run around,\""]
["02:57,960","03:00,400","\"and if you kill them, you get more stamina.\""]
["03:00,400","03:03,800","\"So they're probably not worth seeking out.\""]
["03:03,800","03:05,960","\"You can beat the game without ever doing it,\""]
["03:05,960","03:08,360","\"'cause I know people that didn't even know that.\""]
["03:08,360","03:10,320","\"But if you see a lizard and you kill it,\""]
["03:10,320","03:11,360","\"you get more stamina.\""]
["03:11,360","03:13,400","\"- But the world is already so empty.\""]
["03:13,400","03:14,320","\"- Like I'm sneaking.\""]
["03:14,320","03:16,360","\"No, you,\""]
["03:16,360","03:17,840","\"- Why are you looking at your horse like you're about to do\""]
["03:17,840","03:18,680","\"some dirty?\""]
["03:18,680","03:19,520","\"- I'm coming from fucking--\""]

["03:23,080","03:24,800","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:24,800","03:26,160","\"- I mean, if you succeed in fucking--\""]
["03:26,160","03:27,560","\"- No, don't put your head there,\""]
["03:27,560","03:29,800","\"that is the worst place to put your head.\""]
["03:29,800","03:31,760","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:31,760","03:32,600","\"- Don't you know.\""]
["03:32,600","03:36,400","\"- No, yeah, this game was made for my people.\""]
["03:36,400","03:38,560","\"- The horse people?\""]
["03:38,560","03:41,320","\"- So are there like clues and stuff in the walls?\""]
["03:41,320","03:43,880","\"- Well, he can do something where he raises his sword\""]
["03:43,880","03:46,480","\"and it will show him the direction the Colossus is in.\""]
["03:46,480","03:47,880","\"Exactly.\""]
["03:47,880","03:50,380","\"For his art too to grab onto places.\""]
["03:50,380","03:51,680","\"Why can't I play?\""]
["03:51,680","03:53,080","\"Like hairy places?\""]
["03:53,080","03:53,580","\"Yes.\""]
["03:53,580","03:54,080","\"Exactly.\""]
["03:54,080","03:55,380","\"And he plays like that.\""]
["03:55,380","03:57,380","\"That's what my back looks like.\""]
["03:57,380","03:58,080","\"Does it really?\""]
["03:58,080","03:58,980","\"Just not green.\""]
["03:58,980","04:00,080","\"It's blue.\""]
["04:00,080","04:02,080","\"You know, I thought this game was pretty cool,\""]
["04:02,080","04:03,480","\"but then I saw this rock.\""]
["04:03,480","04:04,780","\"And now I want to turn it off.\""]
["04:04,780","04:06,280","\"Done.\""]
["04:06,280","04:10,280","\"Oh, while holding or to use blue, but do do do climb.\""]
["04:10,280","04:12,280","\"Hey.\""]
["04:12,280","04:13,540","\"- What is this Crash Bandicoot?\""]
["04:13,540","04:14,540","\"This sucks.\""]
["04:14,540","04:15,380","\"- You're gone.\""]
["04:15,380","04:16,220","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:16,220","04:18,020","\"- I don't know, I think this looks pretty smooth.\""]
["04:18,020","04:18,860","\"- No, it looks awesome.\""]
["04:18,860","04:20,540","\"- considering how old this game is.\""]
["04:20,540","04:21,380","\"- Well, this is a remake.\""]
["04:21,380","04:22,220","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:22,220","04:23,980","\"- It is a remake, but I don't think that they touched\""]
["04:23,980","04:25,220","\"the programming a whole lot.\""]
["04:25,220","04:28,180","\"I remember this controlling really well on PS2.\""]
["04:28,180","04:30,740","\"Although I might just be fucking rejecting.\""]
["04:30,740","04:31,780","\"- Does it control well?\""]
["04:31,780","04:32,620","\"- It's really strange.\""]
["04:32,620","04:33,740","\"- It's really strange, 'cause it looks good,\""]
["04:33,740","04:35,300","\"but I don't think it controls that good.\""]
["04:35,300","04:36,220","\"- Yeah, this is a--\""]
["04:36,220","04:37,420","\"- You seem kind of floppy.\""]
["04:37,420","04:40,900","\"- This is one of those games where I remember it\""]
["04:40,900","04:42,780","\"looking almost exactly like this,\""]
["04:42,780","04:44,340","\"but I know if I saw the rest.\""]
["04:44,340","04:46,180","\"- No, if you went back it would look like Tekken One, man.\""]
["04:46,180","04:48,820","\"Like, your memory's tricking you.\""]
["04:48,820","04:49,660","\"- Exactly.\""]
["04:49,660","04:51,020","\"Oh, there it is.\""]
["04:51,020","04:51,940","\"It's the Colossus.\""]
["04:51,940","04:52,980","\"- It's the Iron Giant.\""]
["04:52,980","04:53,980","\"- And there's a shadow.\""]
["04:53,980","04:55,580","\"- Does he become your friend?\""]
["04:55,580","04:56,420","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:56,420","05:00,180","\"- Can you ride up on his shoulder and save the day?\""]
["05:00,180","05:02,500","\"- He doesn't even look like me.\""]
["05:02,500","05:04,260","\"- You should take him back to the lady\""]
["05:04,260","05:06,580","\"and have him give her really big CPR.\""]
["05:06,580","05:07,460","\"(laughs)\""]
["05:07,460","05:08,860","\"- You have a bone arrow from the beginning,\""]
["05:08,860","05:09,860","\"I forgot about it.\""]
["05:09,860","05:14,420","\"The main thing is just stabbing at him. I like how the rocks go right back into the ground\""]
["05:14,420","05:23,100","\"I'm a little man. I'm on your spot. Oh, you don't be a dick. Oh you little shithead\""]
["05:23,100","05:28,960","\"What would you do if a fucking little man? I would be so pissed dude a\""]
["05:28,960","05:35,440","\"Little lily pution. Yeah, little little bit my leg and stabbed me with a yeah started\""]
["05:36,140","05:42,620","\"Killies tent a sewing needle I'm gonna grab his boom and then you try to talk to it and what you are you make\""]
["05:42,620","05:50,520","\"My little man you're holding on to his Turkish focus. This still looks pretty dang good. Yeah, fuck no\""]
["05:50,520","05:56,080","\"Didn't mean to do that. Oh better better make my gun. I've got plenty of blood in that ankle. She's sneaking away\""]

["06:02,220","06:04,220","\"You look good though, fuck off me.\""]

["06:06,220","06:07,220","\"Don't they go away?\""]
["06:07,220","06:08,220","\"Oh yeah, the hole, the hole's gone.\""]
["06:08,220","06:10,220","\"Don't they go away when you're done stabbing it?\""]
["06:10,220","06:13,220","\"I could be fucking wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure-\""]
["06:13,220","06:14,220","\"Oh you mean like there's a new target?\""]
["06:14,220","06:16,220","\"You ragged all of us fucking game.\""]
["06:16,220","06:20,220","\"Yeah, this whole game is about managing when you're floppy and when you're not.\""]
["06:20,220","06:22,220","\"Just stab it until it disappears.\""]
["06:22,220","06:26,220","\"I'm pretty sure that it disappears once it's done doing damage.\""]
["06:26,220","06:29,220","\"Yeah, I'm like 50% sure.\""]
["06:29,220","06:30,220","\"Okay, let's see.\""]
["06:30,220","06:32,220","\"Did you just make it fall?\""]
["06:32,220","06:34,620","\"There we go. Yeah, there you go. I\""]
["06:34,620","06:36,980","\"Told you I haven't played this in\""]

["06:52,500","06:54,780","\"This is the second time. I\""]
["06:54,780","06:57,100","\"This is a remake a set well not even a remake\""]

["07:04,980","07:06,980","\"I'll do it. Oh no\""]
["07:06,980","07:10,820","\"Right in the fucking brain\""]
["07:10,820","07:13,300","\"His brain tears spilling\""]
["07:13,300","07:20,700","\"What do you think what do you think the realistic reaction would be of tiny husband if he was actually?\""]
["07:20,700","07:24,340","\"Confronted by something like this. Oh, okay\""]
["07:24,340","07:26,580","\"- So you think he'd be legitimately happy\""]
["07:26,580","07:31,220","\"or that once it, like, we talk about tiny husband a lot.\""]
["07:31,220","07:34,380","\"Have we recapped what that is in a while?\""]
["07:34,380","07:35,220","\"- No.\""]
["07:35,220","07:36,660","\"- Okay, for me please. - Basically please.\""]
["07:36,660","07:40,420","\"- We found, wait, I thought you were involved\""]
["07:40,420","07:42,060","\"in that whole scheme, were you not?\""]
["07:42,060","07:45,300","\"- I may have no recollection, I often blackout.\""]
["07:45,300","07:48,140","\"- We found these goofy, like cringy,\""]
["07:48,140","07:50,060","\"I guess they're fetish videos on you.\""]
["07:50,060","07:51,060","\"- Yes I was there.\""]
["07:51,060","07:55,440","\"- A guy who, he greenscreens himself tiny,\""]
["07:55,440","07:59,360","\"and then also puts on lady clothes\""]
["07:59,360","08:03,500","\"and does like shots of these big lady feet\""]
["08:03,500","08:04,920","\"stomping after him.\""]
["08:04,920","08:09,740","\"All the videos are called like tiny husband, whatever.\""]
["08:09,740","08:12,260","\"But yeah, do you think that if he was actually\""]
["08:12,260","08:14,660","\"realistically confronted with something that big\""]
["08:14,660","08:17,960","\"that he'd like get excited or that he'd react\""]
["08:17,960","08:18,960","\"like any normal fucking woman?\""]
["08:18,960","08:19,800","\"- He should himself.\""]
["08:19,800","08:22,200","\"- You should, yourself, get a boner and die of a heart attack.\""]
["08:22,200","08:24,240","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:24,240","08:25,280","\"- Also, you're a big bully.\""]

["08:26,920","08:28,520","\"Why would you kill the Colossus?\""]
["08:28,520","08:30,920","\"- 'Cause I wanna bring my fucking girl back.\""]
["08:30,920","08:33,620","\"- What part of the game ever said,\""]
["08:33,620","08:35,080","\"\"\"Hey, go kill these guys?\"\"\""]
["08:35,080","08:36,840","\"- The Mac guy. - At the beginning.\""]
["08:36,840","08:39,040","\"- He does say like, \"\"Hey, you want your--\"\"\""]
["08:39,040","08:41,240","\"- I was too busy listening to you guys\""]
["08:41,240","08:42,400","\"do horse impressions.\""]
["08:42,400","08:43,800","\"- Yeah, no, that's what it says.\""]
["08:43,800","08:45,920","\"It basically just says, \"\"Fuck up the colossi.\"\"\""]
["08:45,920","08:47,040","\"And then like-- - That's another thing.\""]
["08:47,040","08:49,440","\"I remember knowing that just because,\""]
["08:49,440","08:52,920","\"Like from the visuals it was like oh I killed the Colossus. He put his girl down\""]
["08:52,920","08:58,760","\"He's clearly trying to bring her back. You don't need these guys telling you any of that shit. Well, Mick apparently did\""]

["09:16,320","09:24,620","\"Well, yeah, basically what you do is you you get you get her dead body ghost pregnant and entire and then by magical stem cell\""]
["09:24,620","09:30,120","\"Research see that she's satanically revived see that yeah, that's the first hydraulic press\""]
