["14:18,080","14:23,180","\"Yeah, it's really what makes this actually difficult is all the other people that you're sharing\""]
["14:23,180","14:26,260","\"Sharing oh\""]
["14:26,260","14:28,720","\"Yeah, if you're playing this on your own it'd be so fucking easy\""]
["14:28,720","14:33,680","\"Yeah, I think the the addition of extra people actually makes it more of a challenge\""]
["14:33,680","14:41,860","\"So if you're at home with no friends talking about how good you are at this game and how bad we are at this game\""]
["14:41,860","14:45,960","\"We're only bad because that's our best defense. Yeah\""]
["14:46,820","14:50,500","\"We're only bad because this is a fucking six legged race here\""]
["14:50,500","14:56,980","\"Or wait no it'd be a that seems right it'd be a four legged race\""]
["14:56,980","15:03,620","\"Well, there's three wouldn't it be six no the thing like a three one of us is on their hands still\""]
["15:03,620","15:08,100","\"That's right. No, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? Isn't a three legged race?\""]
["15:08,100","15:13,700","\"No, that's a wheel to I'm thinking of a wheelbarrow race. That's the one okay. That's where you tie your legs together\""]
["15:13,700","15:15,660","\"Yeah, right, but you're right if there were\""]
["15:16,060","15:19,380","\"I guess we could also we could also still race yeah\""]
["15:19,380","15:26,040","\"I I was thinking of the wrong kind of strange race also if we we here's here's the other thing is if you\""]
["15:26,040","15:31,740","\"Tod you should do a three-man wheelbarrow race now that I thought of that that rock we're definitely strong enough for it\""]
["15:31,740","15:40,700","\"but uh yeah on the subject of multi-legged races we could actually if we then tie the other person on the sides legs to the\""]
["15:40,700","15:45,420","\"first person's legs then it would still be a three-legged race with three people would have thought they're running into that\""]
["15:45,420","15:50,760","\"Kill me a lot of people might have thought such a thing has there ever been a fun to like it race\""]

["16:15,320","16:20,720","\"To entice other Olympians come fuck them in their garbage chute. I heard all the Olympic\""]
["16:20,720","16:25,840","\"Olympic Village kids do kill do fuck each other. Yeah with condoms because if they didn't\""]
