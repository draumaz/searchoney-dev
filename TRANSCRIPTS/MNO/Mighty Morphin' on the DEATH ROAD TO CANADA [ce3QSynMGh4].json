["01:41,240","01:46,760","\"If you need to Chris a good good move is to like you say from to a corner\""]
["01:46,760","01:50,240","\"But also like throwing a thing in the middle of the entrance knocks them all down\""]
["01:51,120","01:58,080","\"Look we got more bullets there. It looked like good. Hi fucker. There we go. Plenty of bullets for now\""]

["02:45,380","02:47,820","\"Oh, I get a lot of medical supplies, too\""]
["02:47,820","02:54,060","\"We do have a pretty good mechanic in our group. Yeah, a doctor in Santa was a really good get actually because he's a mechanic\""]

["20:23,600","20:28,360","\"But I guess you just start exploring because you need food. I mean this is a big fucking area go inside a house\""]
["20:28,360","20:32,860","\"Okay, I'm just gonna go in that one. It's just below you that right?\""]
["20:32,860","20:37,940","\"fucking idea go to this area go to an area where you won't be stuck in\""]
["20:37,940","20:42,360","\"So like okay. Well, that's a fence. He's already stuck in there. I'm okay. I'm okay\""]

["21:16,360","21:20,980","\"I think you can truly kill them off. I'm sorry. I think more zombies just bleed in from the dark spawner really\""]

["21:40,220","21:43,660","\"You could blow away like six of them and just go through\""]
["21:43,660","21:52,820","\"See it's not that no it is good you're hitting three or four of them at once you really shouldn't be fighting them\""]
["21:52,820","21:57,700","\"I know I'm trying to get three of them. It's kind of hard. I know this game's fucking the most hardest game\""]

["26:30,240","26:35,780","\"Right and then white and black yellow and black were the reason green eventually becomes white\""]
["26:35,780","26:39,680","\"Wasn't he at least in the original he was evil when he was green\""]
["26:39,680","26:46,040","\"And then he turns black and then and then the green candle blows out which was supposed to kill him\""]

["29:07,800","29:11,120","\"I think that really is a payoff to getting the Rangers or something\""]
["29:11,120","29:14,320","\"I don't know what to pay off is one of the Rangers is holding a zombie arm\""]
