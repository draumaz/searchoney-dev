["00:23,320","00:24,400","\"Why'd they do that?\""]
["00:24,400","00:26,040","\"'Cause they lost the rights to Guilty Gear,\""]

["04:24,420","04:32,080","\"Did they render it like for 100 pixels? Probably yeah probably I think so. Yeah, what would they do that?\""]
["04:32,080","04:41,360","\"Wasn't that like 90 that looked like flash like 96 or 95 or something. It's probably closer than that wasn't flash\""]
["04:41,360","04:45,920","\"No, something else like your cats really look like I have no idea what I\""]
["04:46,860","04:52,860","\"You probably have not seen dr. Katz then no really because it looks nothing. Oh, you know what? I'm thinking of the zone party\""]
