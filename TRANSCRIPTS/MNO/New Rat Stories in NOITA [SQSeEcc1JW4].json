["02:01,000","02:07,120","\"Was yeah, I feel like we need to beat this as the noise just once we just have to oh, it's it's it's necessary\""]
["02:07,120","02:11,120","\"The noise needs to get out of the cave for all you viewers at home\""]
["02:11,120","02:17,120","\"No, no, no, I don't will be a series until the day Chris\""]
["02:17,120","02:19,320","\"Chris\""]
["02:19,320","02:23,200","\"Complete the noise run. It's just a bunch of fucking missiles\""]
["02:23,200","02:25,400","\"What what is the noise exacting?\""]
["02:25,400","02:34,040","\"Objective is there like a backstory or no now now I understand it. I finally understand it the noise objective is to ruin\""]
["02:34,040","02:39,000","\"Pizza is it ruin pizza and and the point is\""]
["02:39,000","02:42,920","\"Every other pizza place so it's a comment on how\""]
["02:42,920","02:48,440","\"Pizza delivery guys can mishandle pizzas and it comes to you and it gets all fucked up\""]
["02:48,520","02:51,080","\"So the implication is that everyone else is\""]
["02:51,080","02:56,660","\"Has their pizzas ruined by this mysterious force called the noid\""]
["02:56,660","03:00,240","\"Oh, so it's like by ordering dominoes you avoid the noise\""]
["03:00,240","03:04,000","\"So they're saying your pizza is gonna come and it's not gonna look like shit. Oh\""]
["03:04,000","03:11,160","\"Do they do they hide the other campaign do they say that they like hire military guys to like fight them off or what?\""]
["03:11,160","03:13,160","\"What's the implication there? I?\""]
["03:13,160","03:16,320","\"Don't know if there's any implication about how you avoid the noid\""]
["03:16,440","03:20,000","\"What's important is just that the annoyed is successfully been avoided\""]
["03:20,000","03:26,740","\"That's pretty cool, but I mean they're just they're trying to say that like dominoes drivers are like special forces or something\""]
["03:26,740","03:31,100","\"This is blatantly false that I was actually asking though like\""]
["03:31,100","03:34,920","\"What like what is he doing now? Maybe you're meant to think that\""]
["03:34,920","03:44,460","\"Secret to their to their slightly different shaped box that keeps your pizza protected. Oh, it's probably religious. Oh\""]
["03:45,660","03:49,480","\"You like it wards off like they do a bad omen to have a\""]
["03:49,480","03:51,480","\"Dominos every box\""]
["03:51,480","03:56,020","\"That's what I would do if I own a pizza business. I think that goes without saying\""]
["03:56,020","04:01,080","\"If I owned any kind of business, I would have a priest come every week and bless everything\""]
["04:01,080","04:03,580","\"Dude if I guess I mean why not\""]
["04:03,580","04:07,980","\"Yeah, yeah, if you have annoyed enter your home and you managed to subdue it\""]
["04:07,980","04:09,100","\"Hey, what would you yeah?\""]
["04:09,100","04:10,300","\"What would you do with it?\""]
["04:10,300","04:14,340","\"Would you like call the government or would you try to dissect it yourself?\""]
["04:14,580","04:20,500","\"If there's something like the annoyed if you if you found like an actual living specimen of a noise\""]
["04:20,500","04:24,100","\"Yeah, if it attacked you in your home and you managed to like subdue it\""]

["04:33,740","04:39,220","\"Probably I don't give a fuck the annoyed does kind of deserve whatever is coming to him\""]
["04:39,220","04:43,340","\"I think so yeah, cuz that means anytime I've ever gotten a bad pizza\""]
["04:43,340","04:44,820","\"It wasn't the driver's fault.\""]
["04:44,820","04:46,540","\"It was this guy.\""]
["04:46,540","04:49,460","\"Why would a driver ever mess up a pizza\""]
["04:49,460","04:51,820","\"or be responsible with it or drop it\""]
["04:51,820","04:55,900","\"or shove it in the backseat of his car without a care?\""]
["04:55,900","04:57,660","\"- I got a pizza the other night\""]
