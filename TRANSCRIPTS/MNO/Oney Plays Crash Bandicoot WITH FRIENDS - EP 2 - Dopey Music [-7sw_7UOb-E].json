["00:05,660","00:08,340","\"*phone rings* \"\"Well I don't know what the fuck, what are you gonna hit you?\"\"\""]
["00:08,340","00:10,880","\"The-the fish, 'cause the camera angles so weird.\""]
["00:10,880","00:13,040","\"*phone rings* What? I didn't see a fish.\""]
["00:13,040","00:16,840","\"There was one of these, but it went- I didn't- it went off-screen 'cause the camera's angled weird.\""]
["00:16,840","00:21,060","\"And then, because I had the mask, it launched me upwards even higher, so I missed the jump.\""]
["00:21,060","00:22,820","\"*phone rings* It's weird.\""]
["00:22,820","00:24,920","\"*phone rings* Don't worry, he'll be okay.\""]
["00:24,920","00:27,720","\"*phone rings* What? What? *laughs*\""]
["00:27,720","00:32,640","\"Those fishes like just catch you off guard fish. Yeah, I guess it hit me. I didn't even see it\""]
["00:32,640","00:39,320","\"Yeah, they kind of come out of nowhere. This game is awful. It's not awful. Julie. Why are we playing this?\""]
["00:39,320","00:42,320","\"We could have been playing Kingdom Hearts. See there he is. That's what killed you\""]
["00:42,320","00:48,320","\"It's cuz crash was standing like this. So he was blacking him. The music is like fucking calming\""]
["00:48,320","00:53,280","\"Yeah, it's nice. This is not a cartoon wacky music. This is just like regular nice music\""]
["00:53,280","00:57,300","\"Well, this is what this environment and everything it goes pretty well. I like it\""]
["00:57,300","00:59,300","\"It's I'm just very\""]
["00:59,300","01:03,740","\"My turn I'm just very unused to it is what I'm saying. Wait, does Chris I?\""]
["01:03,740","01:06,980","\"Expect crash bandic. Oh, he just\""]
["01:06,980","01:10,560","\"Jesus you feel so weird in this one here. You do\""]
["01:10,560","01:17,040","\"I just like crash bandicoot to have really like loud and I'm not just music obnoxious in a good way. I like it\""]
["01:17,040","01:23,300","\"Julian I I won't even describe to his music. It's obnoxious. No, it's not. I'm just saying that um\""]
["01:23,860","01:29,540","\"No, that's what that's what Julian said. Yeah, two's not two's good. I would say two's perfect\""]
["01:29,540","01:32,100","\"but\""]
["01:32,100","01:34,640","\"Crash team racing's music started kind of getting there\""]
["01:34,640","01:37,260","\"Was more overstated than understated?\""]
["01:37,260","01:44,500","\"Still good. It's weird playing two and then going back to this. Yeah, cuz uh, and I wish you was to a super\""]
["01:44,500","01:50,020","\"Oh, you're right. There is a fish there. Yeah, we finally made it and then that acts as a slope\""]
["01:50,500","01:55,140","\"Which is kind of weird. I think the later games do anything like that with slopes. Oh\""]
["01:55,140","01:58,300","\"My god, or they get to go fucker\""]
["01:58,300","02:09,340","\"I like this music. It's really dopey. This is a pretty bonus level -\""]
["02:09,340","02:13,100","\"This is a stupid bonus level\""]
["02:13,100","02:19,320","\"These are all very easy. I imagine they get harder though. Oh, they do pretty sure later like the fucking\""]
["02:19,660","02:26,720","\"Cortex bonus levels are really hard and if you want all the jams you got to do one guess what I'm not gonna do\""]
["02:26,720","02:31,600","\"Why do they have passwords did they and not where they're not able to like save to a memory?\""]
["02:31,600","02:34,600","\"This you can with this game. I think it's for people who didn't have one\""]
["02:34,600","02:39,840","\"Yes, I remember one of my favorite things was they did a king of fighters for ps2\""]
["02:39,840","02:44,280","\"It's a really bad game, but uh, they had a mode where you could look at the characters\""]
["02:44,280","02:49,260","\"and if you left it running for like eight hours and came back to it because of how the\""]
["02:49,260","02:53,640","\"character like the characters' hair physics were, the hair would just start clipping through\""]
["02:53,640","02:57,200","\"their model coming up the back of their head and it was like permanent. If you started\""]
["02:57,200","03:01,440","\"playing the game after that happened, it would just be happening in game. And it would mess\""]
["03:01,440","03:06,800","\"up the models too. Sometimes like little details on them would disappear. Like when the characters\""]
["03:06,800","03:10,000","\"are supposed to be wearing a hat and this hat just disappeared because of that.\""]
["03:10,000","03:11,760","\"Where should he boss fight this is?\""]
["03:11,760","03:12,260","\"Yep.\""]
["03:12,260","03:14,260","\"So the first one.\""]
["03:14,260","03:16,260","\"Give him a break.\""]
["03:16,260","03:18,300","\"He's been sitting on his chair all day.\""]
["03:18,300","03:21,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:21,100","03:22,660","\"I like that sound.\""]
["03:22,660","03:23,300","\"You too.\""]
["03:23,300","03:26,060","\"That man's not going to be a name or these games.\""]
["03:26,060","03:26,660","\"He's in crash.\""]
["03:26,660","03:27,660","\"Demerasing actually.\""]
["03:27,660","03:29,060","\"He's stupid.\""]
["03:29,060","03:30,540","\"No, he's epic.\""]
["03:30,540","03:32,660","\"That's like something that really holds up here too.\""]
["03:32,660","03:34,900","\"They took advantage of the fact that's low poly.\""]
["03:34,900","03:35,800","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:35,800","03:37,060","\"There's a lot of weight to the animations.\""]

["03:38,060","03:40,860","\"They... I love that about it.\""]
["03:40,860","03:43,760","\"It was the same problem as...\""]
["03:43,760","03:47,960","\"Wrath of Cortex when like a box breaks open. It just looks super weak and shitty.\""]
["03:47,960","03:50,160","\"Oh my god!\""]
["03:50,160","03:52,660","\"I could never do that.\""]
["03:52,660","03:57,360","\"So much for that.\""]

["03:59,060","04:01,160","\"I thought those pillars broke.\""]
["04:01,160","04:03,360","\"Nah, it's if they're floating.\""]
["04:03,360","04:07,660","\"Why are these turtles trying to kill you?\""]
["04:07,760","04:09,360","\"They're not, they're just poisons.\""]
["04:09,360","04:11,960","\"Poisonous turtles?\""]

["04:21,040","04:22,000","\"Is, um,\""]
["04:22,000","04:23,520","\"analog control.\""]
["04:23,520","04:27,240","\"I mean, it's not suited for these games anyways.\""]
["04:27,240","04:29,280","\"No, but like in any game, like,\""]
["04:29,280","04:31,320","\"you know, in driving games, analog is good for like,\""]
["04:31,320","04:32,560","\"steering slowly or whatever.\""]
["04:32,560","04:35,080","\"I still just like, tap it, like,\""]
["04:35,080","04:37,360","\"just really fast if I want to steer slowly.\""]
["04:37,360","04:42,120","\"I was playing Overwatch and he was pointing out like oh you're you know you can just hold click down\""]

["05:12,680","05:13,180","\"Oh my gosh\""]
["05:13,180","05:14,180","\"Specifically\""]
