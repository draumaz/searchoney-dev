["05:25,740","05:31,100","\"With red water balloons. It's like you should do it. You should fake a monkey death for Halloween\""]
["05:31,740","05:33,740","\"But what if they don't believe it?\""]
["05:33,740","05:35,740","\"What if they?\""]

["05:38,820","05:43,940","\"They just find you inside of it and then it'll have done your job. I'll be millions of miles away in Alabama\""]
["05:43,940","05:49,400","\"You should put a tiny little monkey in a weather weather balloon\""]
["05:49,400","05:52,300","\"and then tell everybody\""]
["05:52,300","05:53,800","\"That it got away\""]
["05:53,800","05:58,800","\"It'd be really fun to put a monkey in a balloon to set it off. It would just jump out. No\""]
["05:59,820","06:01,820","\"Give him a gun\""]
["06:01,820","06:06,280","\"Why would that make it flying above the city shooting\""]
["06:06,280","06:12,020","\"Every day people I think that like people would fund that on Kickstarter like put a monkey in a hot air balloon\""]
["06:12,020","06:14,660","\"Phillip with bananas one harpoon guns let him go\""]
["06:14,660","06:20,660","\"Those are all the different stretch goals. Can we arm him with better weapons?\""]
["06:20,660","06:25,720","\"Every goal is a new upgrade his arsenal. Oh, you know what we could do\""]
["06:25,720","06:29,700","\"We could give him a little a septic tank that hangs on the side of the thing\""]
["06:29,700","06:34,340","\"and then he could hook that up to a super-soaker and spray people with it\""]
["06:34,340","06:39,300","\"You're gonna go to work. You're gonna do it. I think you do it. Just gotta teach him how to use it first in space\""]
["06:39,300","06:42,180","\"Is it going up in the space is he?\""]
["06:42,180","06:48,140","\"No, we'll send him the space to learn how to do stuff in low gravity so it's easier than when he comes back down\""]
["06:48,140","06:50,140","\"We'll put them in the balloon\""]
["06:50,140","06:52,940","\"Good idea, but then his bone density will\""]
["06:52,940","06:56,340","\"That's his problem\""]
["06:56,940","07:03,020","\"Well, we'll give them an assisted monkey to help them up and stuff. Yeah, give them an extending boxing love\""]
["07:03,020","07:07,100","\"We'll give them a little nursing monkey that wears a little nurse hat and dress she'll help now\""]
["07:07,100","07:10,880","\"Now this is just like a little miniature hovering space station type thing\""]
["07:10,880","07:11,480","\"It's okay\""]
["07:11,480","07:17,580","\"So we'll they look down and we'll pay for four balloons and hang a little like monkey house in the center just make a monkey village\""]
["07:17,580","07:19,700","\"That's hovering okay. That's fine\""]
["07:19,700","07:23,740","\"And then what we can like leave it for like 700 years and then come back to see how they're all doing yeah\""]
["07:24,300","07:29,900","\"Chris how much money does this need I think around 40 million dollars\""]
["07:29,900","07:34,180","\"Think about for just a 40. Yeah, well we need to buy\""]
["07:34,180","07:41,420","\"Okay, let's let's be realistic here. We'll buy 10 monkeys to start five girls five men all sexually mature\""]
["07:41,420","07:47,720","\"We'll wait actual men to go with the monkeys or just monkeys. No, no no humans. That's gonna defeat the experiment\""]
["07:47,720","07:51,820","\"Five men will mail monkeys. We'll have to buy 10\""]
["07:52,420","07:55,340","\"Fully fully grown hot air balloons\""]
["07:55,340","08:03,560","\"We need a shit donny better we need a shit ton of fuel and helium we need\""]
["08:03,560","08:11,180","\"Oxygen in case to get up too high we need to make a little monkey settlement area for them all to hang out in we need a little\""]
["08:11,180","08:13,460","\"TV for them\""]
["08:13,460","08:14,660","\"computer\""]
["08:14,660","08:16,660","\"So they\""]
["08:16,620","08:19,660","\"So they can hack satellites. Okay, it's a good idea\""]
["08:19,660","08:23,700","\"Can we get them like a grappling hook so they can kidnap people to bring into their society?\""]
["08:23,700","08:29,220","\"Let's um build a giant like claw machine on the bottom so they can just like make it go down and snag stuff\""]
["08:29,220","08:34,060","\"Okay, come back up into the clouds. That's a good idea. That's how they learn about our world slowly over time\""]
["08:34,060","08:36,560","\"No, no, no, no, they should never learn about our world\""]
["08:36,560","08:40,780","\"We should make them go above the clouds so they can't see underneath the clouds and we should make them fear the clouds\""]
["08:40,780","08:42,860","\"So they never try to go through the nasal blind them\""]
["08:42,860","08:44,860","\"How would you make them feel the clouds, Chris?\""]
["08:44,860","08:50,700","\"Well, we'll put a screen in the center area that like shows them like people be or shows the monkeys be nice to each other\""]
["08:50,700","08:54,980","\"But when the cloud comes it like rips their skin off so the monkeys will fear it\""]
["08:54,980","08:57,300","\"What if they create a weather control device?\""]
["08:57,300","08:59,900","\"If they do that, we'll just add the experiment\""]
["08:59,900","09:03,660","\"We'll push the button and make all the helium just float out and they'll just fall to their death\""]
["09:03,660","09:06,340","\"You shouldn't kill them\""]
["09:06,340","09:12,000","\"Okay, and instead of killing them we'll take out their eyes. That's okay. Yeah\""]
["09:12,260","09:14,260","\"It should just be blind to begin with\""]
["09:14,260","09:20,660","\"Blind monkeys. Yeah, what if they have kids they won't be blind. Well, that's how you develop the sixth sense for these monkeys\""]
["09:20,660","09:22,820","\"Can we also you're trying to make psychic. Yes\""]
["09:22,820","09:29,340","\"Okay, we can breathe. We'll have to genetically alter their Chris when you finally shut off the helium\""]
["09:29,340","09:34,820","\"It will only discover that their their psychic abilities allow them to stay afloat. That's true\""]
["09:34,820","09:38,460","\"Well, that means it worked. Yeah, that means we did it and at that point\""]
["09:38,460","09:42,540","\"We'll bring it back down and shake their hands and reintroduce them in society\""]
["09:42,540","09:45,980","\"They take over\""]
["09:45,980","09:51,160","\"They say the earth is gobshite. Yeah, they say this earth is gobshite\""]
["09:51,160","09:53,940","\"You're a bunch of Amadans\""]
["09:53,940","09:57,980","\"Is that what they sound like?\""]
["09:57,980","10:01,500","\"We sickly children. No, I don't want to teach them English\""]
["10:01,500","10:07,700","\"No, they'll come up with a better language. Let's teach them something like that most people wouldn't like\""]
["10:07,700","10:09,700","\"They come down and they say, \"\"Ooh!\"\"\""]
["10:09,700","10:11,700","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:11,700","10:15,700","\"Yeah, they come down and say, \"\"Ooh, but can we dance?\"\"\""]
