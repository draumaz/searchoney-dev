["01:37,200","01:38,920","\"his whole childhood.\""]
["01:38,920","01:40,000","\"'Cause Virgil made a point of that.\""]
["01:40,000","01:42,760","\"He was like, \"\"You can't get meningitis.\""]
["01:42,760","01:44,000","\"You are epic.\"\"\""]
["01:44,000","01:50,760","\"- People get people, I had to get a meningitis vaccination\""]
["01:50,760","01:52,960","\"before I could live at a college dormitory.\""]
["01:52,960","01:55,000","\"- And did you get meningitis?\""]
["01:55,000","01:58,360","\"No, because I got the vaccination and anti-vexers are wrong.\""]
["01:58,360","01:59,960","\"But you are autistic.\""]
["01:59,960","02:03,320","\"Well, yeah, but that was before the meningitis show.\""]

["02:05,800","02:07,440","\"Yeah, go for it.\""]
["02:07,440","02:11,000","\"When I was in primary school and I was around eight years old,\""]
["02:11,000","02:13,520","\"a kid in our school died of meningitis.\""]
["02:13,520","02:16,280","\"And we all had to get that shot.\""]
["02:16,280","02:19,440","\"But after that, the teacher came in and she was like,\""]
["02:19,440","02:23,320","\"OK, everybody, Michael's parents are coming into school today.\""]
["02:23,320","02:26,760","\"and everyone's gonna draw a nice picture for them.\""]
["02:26,760","02:28,960","\"And then one of the kids said,\""]
["02:28,960","02:30,400","\"\"\"Can we draw him in his coffin?\"\"\""]
["02:30,400","02:34,040","\"- Jesus, I'm just just said, \"\"No.\"\"\""]
["02:34,040","02:36,680","\"- You can't, kids don't fucking know\""]
["02:36,680","02:38,600","\"how to like process shit like that.\""]
["02:38,600","02:42,160","\"Like, that's a fair enough question when you were a kid,\""]
["02:42,160","02:43,000","\"I guess.\""]
["02:43,000","02:45,600","\"- Yeah, like, we were so young,\""]
["02:45,600","02:46,720","\"like no one knew that.\""]
["02:46,720","02:48,240","\"- Why did they come in?\""]
["02:48,240","02:49,240","\"Just to, I don't know,\""]
["02:49,240","02:50,640","\"this is 'cause the school invited them in,\""]
["02:50,640","02:52,720","\"like, and the teat, like they didn't,\""]
["02:52,720","03:00,120","\"I don't know it's all it's probably some they're probably having issues processing what happened and maybe this\""]
["03:00,120","03:05,120","\"Would have friends or something. I don't know anyway, so let's move on to nicer things. Oh, that was a oh\""]
["03:05,120","03:09,480","\"That was a puzzle. I just did kind of was it now. I just I\""]
["03:09,480","03:12,280","\"identified simple colors\""]
["03:12,280","03:16,280","\"That's Christian's husband wife\""]
["03:16,280","03:21,080","\"I don't know if he thinks Mewtwo is male or female this game seems like it's really full of those like\""]
["03:21,680","03:25,480","\"Those feel good not really curved curve balls. Yeah, I\""]
["03:25,480","03:31,920","\"Just thought maybe you'd be you'd be proud of me for being able to distinguish blue from right?\""]
["03:31,920","03:37,680","\"Oh, you're clearly proud of you. So well, I I don't know I did that for you. I played this game for you\""]
["03:37,680","03:43,740","\"I grew a beard for you. I just you know is it too much to get noticed by by my papa every once in a while. Oh\""]
["03:43,740","03:46,600","\"Everyone on this couch has a beard right now\""]
["03:46,600","03:50,960","\"Honestly, oh look at you Chris. You do have quite the beard. Oh no no\""]
["03:50,960","03:58,740","\"Oh, it's good. I never grew a beard until this year. So you got to keep pushing it so that the go-to part connects\""]
["03:58,740","04:04,540","\"Yeah, no literally I didn't know that the longer you leave it the more little hairs actually wake up\""]
["04:04,540","04:05,120","\"Yeah\""]
["04:05,120","04:11,340","\"Yeah, so my little hairs are all waking up right now and every day it gets more disgusting lock in but more little hairs wake up\""]
["04:11,340","04:18,800","\"So I'm trying to see how far it can go wait. Is that true? Yeah, cuz like when you're younger like I'm assuming at one point\""]
["04:18,800","04:24,320","\"You just disgustingly let your beard grow out like at some point in your teenage years or something. Yeah, I\""]
["04:24,320","04:33,140","\"I kind of didn't really realize I was growing facial hair until like someone said like oh your mustache looks good and I was like\""]
["04:33,140","04:41,420","\"But like for my entire life ever since I was 13 I shaved my face regularly so those little hairs never woke up\""]
["04:41,420","04:45,280","\"But now that I'm not shaving they're all waking up and it's really weird awesome, man\""]
["04:45,800","04:50,080","\"But um, I want to see how far I can go at it too at this part at this point\""]
["04:50,080","04:55,240","\"It looks kind of gross. I want to see you with a fucking epic Irishman beard. I want to grow a beard\""]
["04:55,240","04:59,920","\"So that I hope your beard is bright red when I finally finish balding. I'll have something on my face\""]
["04:59,920","05:05,920","\"That's the strategy. That's the old Tomlar one - that is a good retirement plan for your hairline\""]
["05:05,920","05:09,320","\"Is that kids had that's literally my retirement\""]
["05:09,320","05:14,600","\"I've enacted it. They sure do like using the same picture over and over. Yeah\""]
["05:14,600","05:15,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:15,100","05:17,600","\"It's a cool motion graphic.\""]
["05:17,600","05:18,600","\"Uh.\""]
["05:18,600","05:21,600","\"See, you liked it a lot the first time, but what do you think about it the sixth time?\""]
["05:21,600","05:22,600","\"The more they show it the worse.\""]
["05:22,600","05:24,100","\"Dude, that kid's about to get fucked up.\""]
["05:24,100","05:26,100","\"That's a little donty and Virgil right there.\""]

["05:28,100","05:29,600","\"You white-haired pussy.\""]
["05:29,600","05:31,600","\"How come Virgil gets to have white hair?\""]
["05:31,600","05:33,600","\"Here, that's his dad, the demon.\""]
["05:33,600","05:34,600","\"I know who sport he is.\""]
["05:34,600","05:36,600","\"He's holding his hand.\""]
["05:36,600","05:37,600","\"Like a...\""]
["05:37,600","05:39,100","\"Like a bitch.\""]
["05:39,100","05:41,600","\"Look at you, showing affection to your son.\""]
["05:41,600","05:43,100","\"F*** you!\""]
["05:43,600","05:47,040","\"Oh yeah, so in case you weren't paying attention.\""]
["05:47,040","05:51,880","\"In this one, yeah, so in the old Devil May Cry, right?\""]
["05:51,880","05:55,680","\"Dante's dad is a demon and his mom is just a normal human being,\""]
["05:55,680","05:56,680","\"but in this one?\""]
["05:56,680","05:57,520","\"She's an angel.\""]
["05:57,520","05:58,520","\"She's an angel.\""]
["05:58,520","06:00,240","\"So it's even more cool.\""]
["06:00,240","06:03,600","\"I am half-angel, but also half-demon.\""]
["06:03,600","06:04,440","\"That kind of stinks.\""]
["06:04,440","06:06,080","\"That is my story.\""]
["06:06,080","06:07,640","\"That kind of art there is really cool.\""]

["06:08,480","06:09,880","\"Yeah, it's cool.\""]
["06:09,880","06:12,040","\"Except for when it zooms right up on his face like this.\""]
["06:12,040","06:15,040","\"I'll never forget what he did to her, but then you totally did.\""]
["06:15,040","06:17,720","\"And they were like, \"\"Oh, you got meningitis, whatever.\"\"\""]
["06:17,720","06:19,080","\"Is that Sparta right there?\""]
["06:19,080","06:19,580","\"Yeah.\""]

["06:20,800","06:23,920","\"He looks like a-- who's the guy that plays Agent Coulson?\""]
["06:23,920","06:25,480","\"In the original one, then they always\""]
["06:25,480","06:28,720","\"show him as a big epic demon lord guy with big horns.\""]
["06:28,720","06:30,840","\"And this one, he's just like a guy in like--\""]
["06:30,840","06:32,660","\"I don't think they ever showed him as a human dream\""]
["06:32,660","06:34,520","\"for a casual Friday.\""]
["06:34,520","06:37,160","\"He looked like the Tim Curry red horn guy.\""]

["06:38,560","06:40,600","\"Wait, was that from the last--\""]
["06:40,600","06:45,880","\"No, that's not the last unicorn. What legend? That's the movie. I've never actually seen it fully. I've never seen it either\""]
["06:45,880","06:50,520","\"I've just seen that Tim Curry I do want to I finally saw for the first time like a year or two ago\""]
["06:50,520","06:53,440","\"We had a we had a curry and Tim Curry night\""]
["06:53,440","07:01,280","\"Did you like legend from start the finisher was it kind of boring? It's it's campy. It just kind of had it on his noise at that point\""]
["07:01,280","07:05,240","\"Got you his outfit in that movie is fucking incredible though. Oh\""]
["07:05,240","07:07,960","\"Yeah, it's a really awesome costume\""]

["07:17,200","07:19,680","\"I think he's just called the Lord of Darkness. Yeah, I\""]
["07:19,680","07:26,000","\"Like mine better, but you can use that if you want. There's a guy in Dungeon Keeper. I think his name is actually horny\""]
["07:26,000","07:29,960","\"Isn't that the main character of Dungeon Keeper? Yeah, oh\""]
["07:29,960","07:35,760","\"There was like a secret way there, but I didn't go down it whatever you dungeon keeper too was one of my favorite games of all time\""]
["07:35,760","07:37,380","\"and then they ruined it\""]
["07:37,380","07:41,560","\"Like EA bought the rights to it and then we really sit on phones and they just destroyed it\""]
["07:41,560","07:45,100","\"Oh, is that the one where you have to like dig out like space for your dungeon?\""]
["07:45,100","07:50,300","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah for your god like mine. It's like the original Minecraft. I really love that game\""]

["07:59,640","08:01,840","\"I think you did tell him that but no matter\""]
["08:01,840","08:10,440","\"Yeah, this level is fucking so hamfisted and stupid, but every level after this is actually really fucking cool. I love you bro\""]
