["00:28,880","00:56,160","\"I can empathize with her desire to just own a cool castle.\""]
["00:56,160","00:58,160","\"I guess that's her motivation.\""]
["00:58,160","01:01,160","\"[mumbling]\""]
["01:01,160","01:05,160","\"Then her world falls to darkness or something.\""]
["01:05,160","01:09,160","\"She wants this castle, but this castle is worth nothing at all.\""]
["01:09,160","01:10,160","\"It's true, it doesn't exist.\""]
["01:10,160","01:11,160","\"What's that?\""]
["01:11,160","01:12,160","\"Is that what it's supposed to be?\""]
["01:12,160","01:17,160","\"Is that she's trying to claim this world now for herself because she lost her own world or something?\""]
["01:17,160","01:18,160","\"Uh, I guess.\""]
["01:18,160","01:19,160","\"Yeah, you know what?\""]

["01:45,880","01:47,920","\"This is the ending. It is. No, it is a fun ending.\""]
["01:47,920","01:51,280","\"I like it a lot. It's the part I look forward to through the whole game.\""]
["01:51,280","01:52,280","\"Is this world?\""]

["02:27,720","02:29,320","\"Who's looking inside it?\""]
["02:29,320","02:32,600","\"Then allow me another question.\""]
["02:32,600","02:37,200","\"You accept darkness yet choose to live in the light.\""]

["05:21,080","05:23,080","\"Nito Clipto?\""]

["06:04,300","06:08,720","\"Actually genuinely like the prequels for how entertaining they are they well\""]
["06:08,720","06:14,600","\"You can't say that about episode one now thing for episode two honestly episode two is really I would say that more about\""]

["06:23,880","06:30,460","\"Would say episode three gets so stupid and ridiculous though that it's pretty entertaining. Yeah\""]
["06:30,460","06:36,020","\"Oh, that man's dead\""]

["07:04,320","07:07,000","\"This would be the most chaotic universe who can't keep any balance\""]
["07:07,000","07:13,440","\"Like how could you enforce any of that? I don't think the random average citizen knows about any of this shit\""]
["07:13,440","07:18,000","\"That's the implication because whenever they go to a world. They're all like what's a heartless. Yeah\""]
["07:18,000","07:22,760","\"They've been getting attacked by them now though at this point, but they just think they're random monsters\""]
["07:27,400","07:32,320","\"This guy's a piece of shit. No, he's a terrorist. He just loves people so much\""]
["07:32,320","07:39,600","\"That's why he's chosen the symbol. This is a gigantic Valentine he made for you for the whole universe\""]
["07:39,600","07:43,240","\"Kingdom hearts is a violent time\""]

["07:48,840","07:51,680","\"During this scene\""]
["07:53,880","07:58,040","\"Like that he's just hovering there singing it to himself. He's got a very nice voice\""]
["07:58,040","08:05,920","\"You guys are totally ignoring the theme of this game. This one is called sanctuary the one that no one remembers\""]
["08:05,920","08:07,920","\"I don't remember it\""]
["08:07,920","08:15,680","\"Part I remember\""]
["08:20,760","08:24,640","\"Why didn't they just do a new song for every game? I thought that was what they were gonna do\""]
["08:24,640","08:28,760","\"I don't know what they're gonna do too. I guess it's because this one didn't really stick out to people or something\""]
["08:28,760","08:33,960","\"They do do that. No, I think this is the only alternate song they ever did. No, they did one for Kingdom Hearts 3 -\""]
["08:33,960","08:37,600","\"Well, that one hasn't come out yet. I know but the songs out I\""]

["09:17,680","09:22,320","\"Do you think Mickey's voice actor thought this was a little weird to have this character sing these things?\""]
["09:22,320","09:25,260","\"Yes, I'm sure all these people felt really awkward about it. I\""]
["09:25,260","09:30,260","\"Don't know. Maybe they didn't maybe they didn't like maybe this kind of thing feels\""]
["09:30,260","09:35,240","\"I would imagine they have like a big smile on his face having to read that one talk to Riku\""]
["09:35,240","09:41,280","\"Talk to Riku. What does he say? I am definitely that silver boy the silver boy\""]

["10:02,080","10:06,360","\"Well, I'm going to fight you dead.\""]
["10:06,360","10:08,360","\"That is the stupidest intro.\""]
["10:08,360","10:10,360","\"What is cloud doing?\""]
["10:10,360","10:11,360","\"It's big.\""]
["10:11,360","10:14,440","\"You're 100% out of no.\""]
["10:14,440","10:16,840","\"It's an interesting sword you're carrying.\""]
["10:16,840","10:19,440","\"Oh, it's also the wrong one.\""]
["10:19,440","10:20,440","\"I see.\""]
["10:20,440","10:26,640","\"Hey, so here we are after all that, like grinding we were doing at the same time as Pokemon.\""]
["10:26,640","10:32,640","\"I was grinding the dry forms to make sure I had them all at the max.\""]
["10:32,640","10:35,440","\"Uh, it's probably not going to be enough.\""]
["10:35,440","10:36,940","\"I'm probably still going to fuck this up.\""]
["10:36,940","10:40,040","\"I'm sorry everybody, especially because I've got the wrong keyblade.\""]
["10:40,040","10:41,040","\"It's okay, Julia.\""]
["10:41,040","10:42,040","\"Don't fight that thing.\""]
["10:42,040","10:43,040","\"I believe in you.\""]
["10:43,040","10:44,040","\"Oh, you got it.\""]
["10:44,040","10:46,240","\"I'm glad you remembered.\""]
["10:46,240","10:48,480","\"Is this the hardest fight in the game again?\""]
["10:48,480","10:50,160","\"I would say no.\""]
["10:50,160","10:51,160","\"No.\""]
["10:51,160","10:52,760","\"It's probably some of the secret stuff is harder.\""]
["10:52,760","10:55,200","\"They added a lot of cool new stuff on.\""]
["10:55,200","10:59,160","\"I was getting excited by it seeing some of it.\""]
["10:59,160","11:00,640","\"I love Safe You Rode.\""]
["11:00,640","11:01,840","\"We were talking about it earlier.\""]
["11:01,840","11:05,120","\"I think the reason I'm starting to get invested at the end is just because the pacing in\""]
["11:05,120","11:06,960","\"Kingdom Hearts 2 is all over the place.\""]
["11:06,960","11:09,840","\"It's because I fall down with nothing at the beginning.\""]
["11:09,840","11:13,680","\"All the important stuff is either at the beginning or at the end of the game.\""]
["11:13,680","11:16,080","\"in the middle, it puts you to sleep.\""]
["11:16,080","11:20,280","\"I wouldn't even say the beginning, I'd say the very beginning, and then that's it.\""]
["11:20,280","11:24,880","\"Only the first half hour of it, and then it turns into Mulan World and just nonsense\""]
["11:24,880","11:26,480","\"from there.\""]
["11:26,480","11:30,280","\"Then it gets back to it at the end, and it actually ends up being really exciting.\""]
["11:30,280","11:32,280","\"Shit.\""]
["11:32,280","11:36,240","\"All of these new organization fights they added on are really cool.\""]
