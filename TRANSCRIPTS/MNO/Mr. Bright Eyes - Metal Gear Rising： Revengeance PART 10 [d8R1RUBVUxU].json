["00:04,400","00:05,600","\"With friends!\""]
["00:05,600","00:11,600","\"I did have a phase of drawing cartoon characters killing each other in really gory ways, and I did go on for a little too long.\""]
["00:11,600","00:13,600","\"I bet my mom and dad were concerned of that shit.\""]
["00:13,600","00:14,800","\"*laughs*\""]
["00:14,800","00:16,600","\"Like what cartoon characters?\""]
["00:16,600","00:20,400","\"Like, \"\"Pow Puff Girls\"\" and like, \"\"Dextor\"\", \"\"Tasmania\"\".\""]
["00:20,400","00:23,400","\"Every cartoon character just murdering each other on a huge page.\""]
["00:23,400","00:26,400","\"It was like the ultimate \"\"showdown\"\" before that was the thing.\""]
["00:27,400","00:32,820","\"So what you're saying is he stole your idea your genius idea. Yeah pretty much pretty much you know\""]
["00:32,820","00:33,920","\"and uh\""]
["00:33,920","00:35,920","\"It was because my uncle had these weird\""]
["00:35,920","00:40,280","\"He had these magazines called bizarre and it was like a weird like\""]
["00:40,280","00:45,940","\"Half-soft-corp and half like horrible gore and leg rotting bodies and shit\""]
["00:45,940","00:50,460","\"I don't know. I've definitely heard of that magazine. I don't know but you know I found them as a kid\""]
["00:50,460","00:53,220","\"I was like oh my god. This is down real world\""]
["00:54,640","00:59,200","\"Real world I saw some weird stuff in my grandpa's penthouse's\""]
["00:59,200","01:04,640","\"Penthouse I remember they'd have they had comp like they had like hardcore comics in it\""]
["01:04,640","01:11,480","\"And that was the thing that I zeroed in on because I was always just obsessed with cartoons and animation stuff\""]
["01:11,480","01:17,760","\"Oh my god, it looks painful that guy's animated very well. Yeah, everything in this game is pretty well animated. I think\""]
["01:17,760","01:20,840","\"Yeah, you're so right dude\""]
["01:22,960","01:24,960","\"This guy doesn't need that arm\""]
["01:24,960","01:32,680","\"Chris if someone just did that to you would you be mad at them? It's like cut my arm into pieces. Yeah, would you ever forgive them? No\""]
["01:32,680","01:37,840","\"If I would ruin my life like that I would make it my mission to hunt them down and like cut them up\""]
["01:37,840","01:38,920","\"All right\""]
["01:38,920","01:45,240","\"How about this is there any part of your body that you would trust to replace with a machine like if it was like the the future\""]
["01:45,240","01:49,040","\"And they were like my foot your foot. I don't need my foot to be too articulate\""]
["01:49,480","01:56,240","\"Yeah, you know what like robotic legs might work. I definitely wouldn't do it with hands though. No robotic hands seem kind of well\""]
["01:56,240","01:57,120","\"I\""]
["01:57,120","02:01,160","\"Mean a lot of drawing comes from your shoulder and you're like arm your full arm a\""]
["02:01,160","02:04,920","\"Lot of artists say like don't draw with just your hand anyway\""]
["02:04,920","02:10,620","\"Hmm. I don't know. I don't know if I that would be a part of myself that I trust to like be a machine\""]
["02:10,620","02:16,200","\"Ah, I've seen people draw with your feet and they're pretty good. Yeah, no no\""]
["02:16,200","02:22,520","\"I'm saying like would you willingly replace it like just if I would never take away any part of me not anything\""]
["02:22,520","02:26,760","\"No, maybe my pancreas. I think I'd consider it organs\""]
["02:26,760","02:33,120","\"Yeah, cuz you don't need to see those I don't know if I could have like a robot like exoskeleton that protected all my organs\""]
["02:33,120","02:38,760","\"If I got in a car accident, I think I consider that you know what yeah skeleton would be the coolest thing to have actually\""]
["02:38,760","02:42,000","\"You also have the most fucking like surgery scars from that\""]
["02:42,440","02:46,840","\"No, I said exoskeleton like just just something that I like wear over\""]
["02:46,840","02:51,480","\"But then you never get to see your sick ass naked body again. You just take it off. That's the whole point\""]
["02:51,480","02:58,280","\"But that's not part of you. You're just lying to yourself. I guess that's a guess while saying like what would you permanently attach to yourself?\""]
["02:58,280","03:04,480","\"I see no I totally go for I'd love the like Wolverine and a maddiam bones. I totally go for that\""]
["03:04,480","03:10,720","\"You have to unwrap your body like a 3d model. I'd accept that I'd accept the surgical scars. Okay, that would be kind of cool\""]
["03:11,440","03:18,280","\"Hmm. I would you trust eyes? No, you wouldn't know. I think eyes are gonna like be there\""]
["03:18,280","03:22,120","\"They will in the next like decade or two. I'm pretty sure they've already done it\""]
["03:22,120","03:24,300","\"Yeah, like no the technology's existence\""]
["03:24,300","03:30,020","\"It's like the 90s to literally wire an electrical camera into someone's brain and give them basic vision\""]
["03:30,020","03:35,920","\"How do they charge those little eyeballs though? It's just a battery like wow, okay?\""]
["03:35,920","03:39,780","\"How about this right? Mm-hmm. You got robotic eyes. They're perfect\""]
["03:39,780","03:43,780","\"They can zoom in on things you see time slower. You're really fast\""]
["03:43,780","03:51,940","\"The only requirement is they sell jars of fire ants and you have to pour the jars of fire ants into your eyes\""]
["03:51,940","03:57,140","\"No, it doesn't hurt. It just you just see it in first person like a jar of fire ants\""]
["03:57,140","04:00,820","\"They're just nano machines that look like fire. No, they're real live fire ants\""]
["04:00,820","04:05,620","\"Yeah, the the engine of the eyes like churns them up on the inside\""]
["04:05,620","04:09,660","\"-So this is more of like a weird, wicking ritual than technology.\""]
["04:09,660","04:10,660","\"-No, it's technology.\""]
["04:10,660","04:12,940","\"I guess the fuel is just fire ants.\""]
["04:12,940","04:14,860","\"You're an engineer that checks out, right?\""]
["04:14,860","04:15,500","\"-That makes sense.\""]
["04:15,500","04:17,220","\"-Because each ant is very powerful,\""]
["04:17,220","04:19,300","\"and then you put an ant farm inside your eyeball,\""]
["04:19,300","04:19,780","\"so they power it.\""]
["04:19,780","04:21,460","\"-That's why they're red, because they're full of power.\""]
["04:21,460","04:22,380","\"-Yeah.\""]
["04:22,380","04:24,980","\"And I guess if it ever leaks or you need repairs,\""]
["04:24,980","04:27,780","\"there's the possibility that ants can leak into your skull,\""]
["04:27,780","04:29,980","\"but there's only a 10% chance of that happening.\""]
["04:29,980","04:32,300","\"-10% is a huge percent.\""]
["04:32,300","04:34,020","\"-Would you take it?\""]
["04:34,020","04:38,420","\"to bring back my vision yes to replace my eyeball no\""]
["04:38,420","04:40,020","\"yeah okay\""]
["04:40,020","04:44,380","\"what if you only lost one i would you do it one i heard you just keep one i\""]
["04:44,380","04:46,540","\"i would do it one i i'd try it\""]
["04:46,540","04:48,840","\"i would want my depth perception bag\""]
["04:48,840","04:52,460","\"to hear about that woman who had a a bug in her ear she didn't know about it\""]
["04:52,460","04:55,180","\"and she started thinking like really scary things and then when they remove\""]
["04:55,180","04:57,900","\"the bug she was back to normal\""]
["04:57,900","05:00,420","\"the sounds a little urban mythi\""]
["05:00,420","05:03,540","\"it is completely made up okay i i i i i i\""]
["05:03,540","05:05,020","\"- It sounds believable, I don't know.\""]
["05:05,020","05:08,100","\"- Well, I assumed it wasn't exactly how you explained it,\""]
["05:08,100","05:09,260","\"but I thought that there was a maybe.\""]
["05:09,260","05:10,740","\"- We're like, yeah, there's some explanation.\""]
["05:10,740","05:12,020","\"- I just wanted to see if you guys would be\""]
["05:12,020","05:12,940","\"tricked even a little bit.\""]
["05:12,940","05:15,180","\"- It's little legs, we're just pushing on the lobes\""]
["05:15,180","05:19,140","\"of her brain, giving her weird like hallucinations.\""]
["05:19,140","05:21,260","\"I mean, that's happened to people with brain tumors\""]
["05:21,260","05:23,420","\"where they see like really bizarre things\""]
["05:23,420","05:25,100","\"that don't make any sense,\""]
["05:25,100","05:26,740","\"and then it turns out they had a brain tumor.\""]
["05:26,740","05:28,300","\"- Imagine if an earway got into your brain,\""]
["05:28,300","05:30,860","\"what kind of things would make you think about it?\""]
["05:30,860","05:31,860","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:31,860","05:33,780","\"- I don't think they actually crawl into your ear.\""]
["05:33,780","05:35,540","\"- No, I think that was an urban legend.\""]
["05:35,540","05:36,540","\"- Yeah, I think so.\""]
["05:36,540","05:38,660","\"- People have had spiders in their ear though, I've seen it.\""]
["05:38,660","05:39,980","\"My mom's friend had it.\""]
["05:39,980","05:41,980","\"She had like a full like,\""]
["05:41,980","05:44,140","\"tarantula inside of her ear.\""]
["05:44,140","05:45,060","\"- No way.\""]
["05:45,060","05:47,220","\"- And like ate all of her brain and controlled her.\""]
["05:47,220","05:48,380","\"- You're lying.\""]
["05:48,380","05:49,300","\"- Then we made hell benders.\""]
["05:49,300","05:50,460","\"- That was an episode of hell benders.\""]
["05:50,460","05:51,660","\"It wasn't about to say.\""]
["05:51,660","05:53,220","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:53,220","05:55,060","\"- This music is very strange.\""]
["05:55,060","05:57,580","\"- It's the boss music for this character.\""]
["05:57,580","05:58,780","\"- Is she back now?\""]
["05:58,780","06:00,820","\"- She's not back, it's just a person with her like,\""]
["06:00,820","06:05,540","\"I think this is just an indicator we're getting your end game because it's starting to give us like\""]
["06:05,540","06:08,740","\"Read on bosses. Huh? That's a pretty\""]
["06:08,740","06:16,020","\"Conventional thing to do right. Yeah, I do like a boss rush. No. Yeah, I've got a fucking slice her stick\""]
["06:16,020","06:20,900","\"Hey, gotta slice her stick be funny - you gotta admit\""]
["06:20,900","06:29,200","\"Motherfucker what's that dragon ball move when you turn right again? Okay? Oh, yeah, that was it that was short-lived\""]
["06:29,460","06:34,980","\"Yeah, it was that that guy has a bad habit of like forgetting everything that he writes and then just like bringing in a new\""]
["06:34,980","06:38,900","\"Okay, okay was just like the super say not before super sayin yeah\""]
["06:38,900","06:46,320","\"It's pretty funny like the disparity between like the dragon ball fans that like are like doing math to figure out\""]
["06:46,320","06:53,560","\"Like who would win in a fight and then the guy who's like did we do a super sayin - I thought the super sayin - was the long-haired one\""]
["06:54,420","07:00,660","\"The Super Saiyan 2 was was just when his hair was extra sticky-uppy and 3 was the long-haired one\""]
["07:00,660","07:05,840","\"Yeah, I think the guy didn't intend for that to be Super Saiyan 2 and then everyone called it that and he was like\""]
["07:05,840","07:07,460","\"Oh, okay. I guess it's that\""]
["07:07,460","07:13,220","\"Yeah, they definitely never say said Super Saiyan 2 in the show really well\""]
["07:13,220","07:17,060","\"I mean like it's definitely all that's they said something they did they did it\""]
["07:17,060","07:22,140","\"Further beyond yeah, like I really I feel like they didn't call it that at the time\""]
["07:22,220","07:27,220","\"But I was so used to the way people talked about it on the internet that I was like I don't know\""]
["07:27,220","07:30,180","\"It is one of those things where there's this weird\""]
["07:30,180","07:37,020","\"There's this weird disconnect between what the fans obsess over and what the actual like storyteller focuses on\""]
["07:37,020","07:37,580","\"Yeah, well\""]
["07:37,580","07:43,820","\"I mean that's that's kind of the way that almost anything works because like the internal logic of of a show or something\""]
["07:43,820","07:49,620","\"Ultimately it takes the backseat to like what has to happen plot wise. So it's like\""]
["07:50,300","07:56,540","\"And it's not always like a especially in things like live action TV shows\""]
["07:56,540","08:03,880","\"You know it's like a character is stronger than another character like that doesn't like factor into it\""]
["08:03,880","08:08,220","\"I don't know people are weird with how they like analyze media sometimes especially nerds\""]
["08:08,220","08:14,520","\"I'm not a nerd. I say a lot of a lot of anime have definitely borrowed from Dragon Ball doing the whole like quantifying\""]
["08:14,520","08:18,940","\"Power levels and stuff. Yeah, but even that the guy goes on record needs like yeah\""]
["08:18,940","08:23,280","\"The whole point of power levels was like because I wanted to say they were stupid or like that\""]
["08:23,280","08:29,500","\"I wanted the guy to win despite that, you know? Yeah, you only have power levels so that we can like\""]
["08:29,500","08:32,040","\"Fuck we can say how they don't matter\""]
["08:32,040","08:37,360","\"Yeah, it would be like you know like a really scrawny guy beating up a buff guy\""]
["08:37,360","08:41,520","\"It's like the point is he was like I wanted to make it so it would be like whoa\""]
["08:41,520","08:46,740","\"He's not supposed to win that fight and then he wins that fight, but nobody really that point was completely lost\""]
["08:46,820","08:52,620","\"No, cuz everyone is still just obsessed with like well definitely by this point in a series Goku's power level would be\""]
["08:52,620","08:56,900","\"2.5 million because freezes was too million and he best immediately like\""]
["08:56,900","09:06,060","\"This there's a lot of discussion like that. Yeah, and I and I I read it at great length when I was in high school\""]
["09:06,060","09:08,060","\"And I guess more middle school, but yeah\""]
["09:08,060","09:13,020","\"What'd you get a rocket? I've had it. I just forget that I have it\""]
["09:13,020","09:16,420","\"And that's how I killed\""]
["09:16,420","09:21,320","\"Tom, what would you do if you were sitting at home with Jaxie and Santa Christ walked in?\""]
["09:21,320","09:23,720","\"Santa Christ yeah\""]
["09:23,720","09:28,800","\"Who's Santa Christ? You're oh my god. Tom our wake up dude. Just wake up\""]
["09:28,800","09:31,720","\"Is that just a combination of Santa and Jesus?\""]
["09:31,720","09:36,100","\"Yeah, I mean you probably have Rob Walker\""]
["09:36,100","09:41,800","\"Well, I mean walker is that Doug Walker's brother? Yes. Yeah, Santa Christ is a titular\""]
["09:42,220","09:50,040","\"Well, he's not titular look. I guess he is I don't think it would matter to Tomar because for Tomar both Santa and Jesus are Moses\""]
["09:50,040","09:56,300","\"Oh my god in Judaism, right? Yeah, that's how that works. He brings you Hanukkah presents and he died\""]
["09:56,300","10:04,140","\"That is a weird thing like that when I say it Chris I think of the South Park pilot. Oh, yeah\""]
["10:04,140","10:09,640","\"Nobody ever mentions that like Moses got like fucked over at the end of his story. Yeah\""]
["10:10,020","10:12,020","\"He was punished because of\""]
["10:12,020","10:15,100","\"Because he hit a rock\""]
["10:15,100","10:18,940","\"Yeah, that's the me that's the like old Jewish me Josh anyway\""]
["10:18,940","10:25,420","\"The reason why he wasn't allowed to ever see the promised land after 40 years of wandering in the desert for nothing\""]
["10:25,420","10:32,620","\"Was because one time God told him to talk to a rock to get water and instead of just talking to it\""]
["10:32,620","10:36,900","\"He hit it with a stick first and God's like I didn't like that extra detail you added\""]
["10:37,380","10:43,700","\"Yeah, I didn't like that. Yeah, I'm provised. He's like you didn't put your I didn't enlist you to put your own special\""]
["10:43,700","10:46,700","\"What a fucking worship that God what an complete piece of shit\""]
["10:46,700","10:50,500","\"It's I think it's a totally valid point that you're not just ever supposed to make\""]
["10:50,500","10:55,060","\"No, that happens a lot that's in the Christian Bible too is like\""]
["10:55,060","10:59,740","\"At the end of the story. Yeah, he just he kind of just gets screwed over\""]
["10:59,740","11:05,060","\"It's like um huckleberry Finn where they they they don't they don't tell you the last part a lot\""]
["11:05,500","11:06,780","\"What's the last part?\""]
["11:06,780","11:11,380","\"I do think the whole idea, at least with like the Christian side of it, is that it's like\""]
["11:11,380","11:17,580","\"the fact that Jesus died despite being this really good dude is to prove the point that like the\""]
["11:17,580","11:20,980","\"Justice of Man is shit and the Justice of God is the only good one.\""]
["11:20,980","11:23,380","\"Yeah, but that's a happy ending for Jesus gets to go to heaven.\""]
["11:23,380","11:27,780","\"Again, if you look at the Justice of God in the context of the Old Testament, it's like really?\""]
["11:27,780","11:33,260","\"There's also a certain point where you're just like God is just torturing people for no fucking reason at all.\""]
["11:33,260","11:35,340","\"Yeah, like like poor Joe\""]
["11:35,340","11:36,180","\"- I'm gonna kill Job.\""]
["11:36,180","11:37,260","\"- Reasing.\""]
["11:37,260","11:39,220","\"Job is a great example.\""]
["11:39,220","11:41,420","\"- Is that the guy who's always buy it?\""]
["11:41,420","11:42,780","\"- He's the guy who God was like,\""]
["11:42,780","11:44,040","\"\"\"You know, I'm gonna kill your whole family\""]
["11:44,040","11:45,060","\"\"\"and you'll still worship me.\"\"\""]
["11:45,060","11:47,700","\"- No, like yeah, the whole story is it's like,\""]
["11:47,700","11:49,140","\"or I don't know if it's the whole story,\""]
["11:49,140","11:51,460","\"but like definitely part of it of the book of Job\""]
["11:51,460","11:54,100","\"is it's like God and the devil basically have a bet\""]
["11:54,100","11:56,460","\"and he's like, \"\"Your people only worship you\""]
