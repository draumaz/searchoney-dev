["12:31,260","12:37,100","\"Did it did I lose my there it is? Yep, okay? I had to literally glitch the system to get that to work\""]
["12:37,100","12:39,460","\"Where are you I don't know man?\""]
["12:39,460","12:44,500","\"Okay, I'm back in the car. Oh glitch. Yeah, it was your house here before\""]

["13:42,820","13:46,540","\"Looking into a building so mar is this how you make a game with minimal effort?\""]
["13:46,540","13:54,140","\"Obviously some effort went in but this I think this just makes the point of like making games ain't easy\""]
["13:54,140","14:00,860","\"Yeah, it's hard you put in a whole bunch of effort and make a whole bunch of stuff and it still can be a complete shit\""]
["14:00,860","14:02,860","\"Here's the thing. Here's the thing\""]
["14:02,860","14:07,100","\"Even it but if that's the case, let's just let's admit that yes making a game is hard\""]
["14:07,100","14:12,300","\"But but is it ethical but do you charge ten bucks for it? Yeah, okay?\""]
["14:12,300","14:15,200","\"This is more expensive than those really good free games\""]
["14:15,200","14:18,900","\"I suck at the piano and it's because it's very hard to do\""]
["14:18,900","14:25,040","\"But I would never I'd never charge admission to a concert of me trying to play a fucking piano\""]

["17:08,140","17:12,060","\"Became critical doesn't that reset you automatically when this happens?\""]
["17:12,060","17:17,180","\"No, you got to go into town and buy new car parts and then you got to read a instruction manual on how to fix your car\""]
["17:17,180","17:22,220","\"Are you fucking serious? I guess long rewind let's try that again\""]
["17:22,980","17:28,340","\"How the fuck are you supposed to get no you know what go back to the factory the factory\""]
["17:28,340","17:33,980","\"Yeah, go back to the factory. It's gonna fall through the ground again. Oh, you're good. Yeah, you fixed the game\""]
["17:33,980","17:37,120","\"So look do you see where it says observatory center?\""]
["17:37,120","17:41,700","\"Yes, or central with the arrow. Yeah, try to get in there. Okay\""]
["17:41,700","17:46,620","\"I want to see if if we've got a populated town or some shit, okay\""]
["17:46,620","17:49,420","\"That's so fucked you have to look at their exclamation\""]

["18:38,500","18:43,720","\"Wait, really? Yeah, it's that it's behind you on the street. Oh, yeah structure one wing. I think you're gonna die now\""]
["18:43,720","18:46,360","\"You're at structure. No beautiful turn. Thanks, man. I\""]
["18:47,420","18:49,420","\"Want it to be day so this\""]
["18:49,420","18:56,840","\"You can give you a safe spot to clue you in I hate that. It's nighttime. I really do. Oh great. Thank you. Oh\""]

["19:12,980","19:16,980","\"Okay, this is the famous structure 120 the famous\""]

["19:23,980","19:26,980","\"I think I said effort went into this just not in all the right places.\""]
["19:26,980","19:28,980","\"How do we get up to structure 120?\""]
["19:28,980","19:30,980","\"Probably got to get out of your car.\""]

["20:42,780","20:49,340","\"You probably have to try to put her up into that you're so fucking right he was just saying in his little instruction manual\""]
["20:49,340","20:53,700","\"Alright, so that's the little ramp that you go up and then okay\""]
["20:53,700","20:59,500","\"I'm truly curious as to where this story is gonna go the fucking house just light up and fucking fly into space\""]
