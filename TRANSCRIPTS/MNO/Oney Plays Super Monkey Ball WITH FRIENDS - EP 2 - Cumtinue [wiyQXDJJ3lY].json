["08:26,340","08:32,620","\"Because you're not moving with the platform the platform sliding you along it is the thing so you can fall off a bit\""]
["08:32,620","08:39,860","\"Oh, I fucking hate these bananas. That's called inertia. I know what inertia is. It's in space. It's a property of matter\""]

["09:12,460","09:13,560","\"I'm not being mean.\""]
["09:13,560","09:15,260","\"You got to kill himself.\""]
