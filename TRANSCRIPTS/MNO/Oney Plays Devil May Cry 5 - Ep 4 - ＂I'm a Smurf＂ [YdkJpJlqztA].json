["03:03,200","03:04,600","\"in the middle of this little fucking--\""]
["03:04,600","03:06,800","\"- Yeah, we could have beautiful women like this,\""]
["03:06,800","03:09,400","\"but people just don't know how to raise their children.\""]
["03:09,400","03:11,600","\"- All you need is to make this spray.\""]
["03:11,600","03:14,240","\"All you need is some kind of concentrated chloroform\""]
["03:14,240","03:15,800","\"that goes through the skin's pores.\""]
["03:15,800","03:23,800","\"I'll say this, when we're at the diner and the kids start crying and Corey's having insane rage and his face is slowly getting redder and redder with anger.\""]
["03:23,800","03:26,800","\"When Jeff hears the kids, his pants just get tighter.\""]

["03:40,800","03:42,800","\"You can sleep forever.\""]
["03:43,800","03:48,780","\"Yeah, you know if you dip it in amino acids, but I'm gonna wake up after that that'll make them strong\""]
["03:48,780","03:53,900","\"Yeah, it makes them stronger exactly. You know I send them to the sleep dimension permanently\""]
["03:53,900","03:58,580","\"Cory, what would you do if a baby's enzymes just disappeared enzymes?\""]
["03:58,580","04:03,140","\"What's enzymes? None of your frickin business, and I don't know how to respond to this question\""]
["04:03,140","04:10,680","\"Isn't that little sugars inside your body that caused chemical reactions. I gotta know something. They told me something\""]
