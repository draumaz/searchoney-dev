["03:44,440","03:46,040","\"They should do that in Mario Odyssey\""]
["03:46,040","03:48,080","\"is if he takes too much damage from something,\""]
["03:48,080","03:50,000","\"like if he falls from a height and stuff is going,\""]
["03:50,000","03:51,080","\"\"\"Oof!\"\"\""]
["03:51,080","03:52,400","\"He should go, \"\"Wow!\"\"\""]
["03:52,400","03:53,840","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:53,840","03:55,200","\"He's actually fearful for his life.\""]
["03:55,200","03:56,800","\"He crawls on the ground for a little bit.\""]
["03:56,800","03:58,080","\"He can't stand back up.\""]
["03:58,080","04:01,520","\"He has a link for a minute.\""]
["04:01,520","04:04,760","\"Better find some coin.\""]
["04:04,760","04:06,120","\"No, the way he goes to the real world\""]
["04:06,120","04:08,120","\"with like realistic proportion people.\""]
["04:08,120","04:09,160","\"He has her Pauline's the mayor.\""]
["04:09,160","04:13,480","\"They should give him real human physics, so if he jumps more than three feet, he breaks his leg.\""]
["04:13,480","04:16,020","\"The bone pops out.\""]
["04:16,020","04:18,920","\"Yeah, and then he has to crawl slowly to a hospital.\""]
["04:18,920","04:20,680","\"Crawl slowly.\""]
["04:20,680","04:22,380","\"What is bone sticking out of his leg?\""]

["04:24,720","04:28,420","\"No, he starts crying like really realistically.\""]
["04:28,420","04:31,840","\"Real realistically.\""]
["04:31,840","04:34,140","\"Mario will burn.\""]
["04:34,140","04:37,840","\"Really like it in Resident Evil 2 when you take a lot of damage and you start limping and shit.\""]
["04:38,220","04:40,540","\"I need to do the same thing before. You get super slow.\""]
["04:40,540","04:45,840","\"There's a, there's a face in the original Doom where his eyes are wide open and he's screaming.\""]
["04:45,840","04:46,500","\"Really?\""]
["04:46,500","04:50,780","\"And it's supposed to be for when you, I forget how much damage it is, like 60 or 80 or something.\""]
["04:50,780","04:53,400","\"Which is something that's basically gonna kill you.\""]
["04:53,400","04:58,740","\"But they, uh, they glitched it in the code so it wouldn't show up properly until people fixed it later on.\""]
["04:58,740","04:59,240","\"Oh.\""]
["04:59,240","05:01,220","\"Well, I like it, Dad!\""]
["05:01,220","05:05,740","\"I like stuff like that. I like, uh, different reactions that characters can have.\""]
["05:07,300","05:08,560","\"Are they drowning in there now?\""]
["05:08,560","05:09,760","\"Uh, kinda?\""]
["05:09,760","05:11,560","\"But they're still moving, so it's okay.\""]
["05:11,560","05:12,760","\"They bleed through their anus.\""]
["05:12,760","05:14,760","\"I don't believe that.\""]
["05:14,760","05:17,160","\"It's Mario.\""]
["05:17,160","05:18,160","\"Anything's bossy.\""]
["05:18,160","05:19,160","\"He's floating.\""]
["05:19,160","05:20,720","\"Hi!\""]
["05:20,720","05:22,500","\"I love you.\""]
["05:22,500","05:25,000","\"I think he jumps out of a window.\""]
["05:25,000","05:26,080","\"That's what he says in my drink.\""]
["05:26,080","05:27,080","\"That's my sweetheart.\""]
["05:27,080","05:28,320","\"Wow!\""]
["05:28,320","05:30,280","\"Mario says I love you, the creepy boss.\""]
["05:30,280","05:30,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:30,780","05:34,120","\"Mario says we the \"\"I love you\"\" virus.\""]
["05:34,120","05:35,480","\"Do you remember that?\""]
["05:35,480","05:35,980","\"I do.\""]
["05:35,980","05:39,420","\"Every time you type in, vvvvvvvvv, it says I love you.\""]
["05:39,420","05:40,260","\"- Excuse me?\""]
["05:40,260","05:41,580","\"- No, it's whatever you type in,\""]
["05:41,580","05:43,020","\"it makes it say I love you.\""]
["05:43,020","05:44,340","\"(clapping)\""]
["05:44,340","05:45,700","\"- It was a press.\""]
["05:45,700","05:49,220","\"- The original was that it was an email,\""]
["05:49,220","05:52,460","\"that if you opened it, because Microsoft Outlook fucking sucked\""]
["05:52,460","05:53,740","\"and everything was exploitable,\""]
["05:53,740","05:55,540","\"I don't remember that. - I don't remember that.\""]
["05:55,540","05:57,980","\"- It would circulate itself between all of your contacts,\""]
["05:57,980","05:59,740","\"so it just kept spreading outward.\""]
["05:59,740","06:02,460","\"- I'm probably thinking of a different virus.\""]
["06:02,460","06:05,020","\"- Windows was really vulnerable way back.\""]
["06:05,020","06:09,580","\"You could open anything and it could just fuck with you.\""]
["06:09,580","06:11,940","\"- One of the first viruses I ever got was,\""]
["06:11,940","06:14,780","\"fucking naked lady would appear on screen\""]
["06:14,780","06:17,820","\"spreading her pussy and try to connect to a server\""]
["06:17,820","06:21,700","\"to buy something and it would come up every 10 minutes.\""]
["06:21,700","06:23,300","\"- Did you get Banzi buddy?\""]
["06:23,300","06:24,580","\"I had Banzi buddy.\""]
["06:24,580","06:25,420","\"- Did you really?\""]
["06:25,420","06:26,260","\"- Actually.\""]
["06:26,260","06:28,180","\"- I actually got Banzi buddy as a kid.\""]
["06:28,180","06:30,260","\"- Like you thought it was fun?\""]
["06:30,260","06:31,100","\"- Yes.\""]
["06:31,100","06:32,700","\"- Or because you knew I had a lot of suits.\""]
["06:32,700","06:36,140","\"I liked click-clickable, or they clickmates or something.\""]
["06:36,140","06:36,980","\"- That's not buddies?\""]
["06:36,980","06:38,140","\"- Yeah, like desktop buddies.\""]
["06:38,140","06:38,980","\"- I had one of those.\""]
["06:38,980","06:41,220","\"- I love the idea of those when I was a little kid\""]
["06:41,220","06:42,180","\"'cause I'm a baby.\""]
["06:42,180","06:44,500","\"I was entertained by simple things.\""]
["06:44,500","06:46,340","\"So I fell for BonziBuddy.\""]
["06:46,340","06:48,640","\"I got CometCursor, I remember.\""]
["06:48,640","06:51,340","\"What else did I get?\""]
["06:51,340","06:53,180","\"I downloaded so many of those.\""]
["06:53,180","06:55,900","\"- So is BonziBuddy just considered a virus?\""]
["06:55,900","06:58,540","\"- Yeah, 'cause it would mail out personal information.\""]
["06:58,540","06:59,380","\"- Really?\""]
["06:59,380","07:00,540","\"- To their servers.\""]
["07:00,540","07:02,300","\"- And it would ask you for it all the time too.\""]
["07:02,300","07:09,380","\"I never I never really heard of it until recently but it's a little purple monkey right\""]
["07:09,380","07:15,380","\"yeah I was I mean I was using the Internet since like 1996 so that was not a not a good\""]
["07:15,380","07:20,980","\"point to let a small child on the Internet when everything was very easy to exploit\""]
["07:20,980","07:26,580","\"I'm trying to remember which one I had I had I had a desktop buddy but I can't remember\""]
["07:26,580","07:31,780","\"what it was I had a turkey and you could cut a tad off I had something that walked around\""]
["07:31,780","07:36,140","\"screen it was the fucking bloodhound gang it was the fucking little monkeys from\""]

["07:53,900","08:00,540","\"and pop up I had a game called warning forever that was free and I loved it\""]
["08:00,540","08:06,380","\"But every time I installed it it fucked up every computer. I ever installed it on but I still liked it so much like I kept doing it\""]
["08:06,380","08:07,500","\"I\""]
["08:07,500","08:13,860","\"Mean I remember doing the thing was I had I had family who are they were paranoid about viruses\""]
["08:13,860","08:17,880","\"So I had my favorite game for the PC when I was younger was Windows\""]
["08:17,880","08:22,820","\"3d Movie Maker. I loved the shit out 3d movie. I play it all the time\""]
["08:22,820","08:29,340","\"I had Nickelodeon 3d Movie Maker 2 and what ended up happening was that it crashed one time just because things were crash all the time\""]

["08:31,340","08:37,580","\"The error message popped up and my mom saw it and she freaked out. It's like is that a virus?\""]
["08:37,580","08:40,900","\"Is that a virus and she ended up throwing the disc out my game?\""]
["08:40,900","08:44,060","\"She thought it infected the PC. Oh\""]
["08:44,060","08:48,940","\"Turns out it was because she downloaded a theme for Valentine's Day\""]
["08:48,940","08:54,820","\"They had a virus attached to it. I hate to embarrass these stupid shit that they think doesn't matter, but really does\""]
["08:55,420","09:00,420","\"Like like I remember when my mom gave away my second Genesis my mom used to do that all and I got home\""]
["09:00,420","09:03,120","\"She would blame me. I got home and I was like where's my second?\""]
["09:03,120","09:09,760","\"Everybody that was in our age group at that time that probably happened probably had most of possessions thrown out and everything\""]

["09:43,500","09:47,940","\"I lent a no I tell that story I did to give a lot of people\""]
["09:48,620","09:51,040","\"I'm no I remember a guy scratched up one of my games\""]
["09:51,040","09:55,220","\"So I stole one of his games and snapped it in two because I didn't like the game, but he did\""]

["10:07,780","10:11,820","\"I was a little passive aggressive bitch about it. I was like eight or something though\""]
["10:11,820","10:16,500","\"It's your mr. Grandy a two-caught. I never I never felt good about the whole stealing thing though\""]
["10:16,500","10:21,340","\"because I remember the one time I was tempted to do it was that a kid had crazy bones and\""]
["10:21,340","10:27,860","\"He insisted one of them was really rare even though. No, they fucking weren't. Yeah, it's crazy bones\""]
["10:27,860","10:31,300","\"Yeah, I think the only thing I ever stole besides that was like a\""]
["10:31,300","10:36,440","\"Connects piece and I felt so guilty. I ran back to the guy's house\""]
["10:36,440","10:41,900","\"And I slipped it back into his thing. That was the same thing that happened was that he brought over a Pokemon thing and\""]
["10:41,900","10:44,300","\"He left it under something as like oh\""]
["10:45,580","10:48,060","\"Yeah, you'll be like stealing it. We'll have it. No\""]
