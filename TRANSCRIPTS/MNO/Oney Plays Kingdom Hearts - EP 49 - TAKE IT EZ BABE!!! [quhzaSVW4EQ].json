["06:47,840","06:54,660","\"The best part is he tipped $1\""]
["06:54,660","07:04,220","\"But to be fair you only spent like $6, so it's fair, but it was so funny\""]
["07:04,220","07:11,140","\"Here's the picture as yeah as the story ends be sure to throw up the photo here is\""]
["07:11,820","07:15,920","\"Said should be a zero dollar tip and you underlined it like 20 times\""]

["08:45,380","08:48,380","\"Guess we're canceling that one.\""]
["08:48,380","08:49,300","\"It was really weird.\""]
["08:49,300","08:52,260","\"- Wait, what was he that you canceled it\""]
["08:52,260","08:53,340","\"while you were in the car?\""]
["08:53,340","08:55,020","\"- No, he wouldn't cancel it.\""]
["08:55,020","08:57,780","\"- Yeah, he wouldn't cancel it.\""]
["08:57,780","08:59,740","\"And he was telling us to just get in\""]
["08:59,740","09:02,820","\"after just yelling at us for like a minute and a half.\""]
["09:02,820","09:04,340","\"What have I been like, fuck you dude.\""]
["09:04,340","09:06,220","\"- Well, it's like, why would you do that?\""]
["09:06,220","09:08,260","\"Because this is your job.\""]
["09:08,260","09:10,260","\"What are you expecting to have happen\""]
["09:10,260","09:13,020","\"if you're gonna start yelling and swearing at people?\""]
["09:13,020","09:15,260","\"'Cause what happened was that we needed\""]
["09:15,260","09:17,420","\"to grab something really quick and Julian had asked,\""]
["09:17,420","09:20,300","\"like, is it okay if we can have a minute here for that?\""]
["09:20,300","09:22,460","\"And he was fine for it.\""]
["09:22,460","09:23,820","\"And as soon as I came outside,\""]
["09:23,820","09:26,180","\"he just started yelling and swearing at us.\""]
["09:26,180","09:28,500","\"And he was saying, like, I don't fucking get paid extra\""]
["09:28,500","09:29,700","\"for this shit.\""]
["09:29,700","09:31,580","\"And it's just like, okay.\""]
["09:31,580","09:32,420","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:32,420","09:37,860","\"said that was okay if we grabbed something really quick. It just made a big fuss about it.\""]
["09:37,860","09:45,460","\"Like I get it if you aren't patient for that kind of thing. We also probably would have\""]
["09:45,460","09:53,140","\"tipped because we spent a minute there. But I don't know why in any situation you'd feel the need\""]
["09:53,140","09:58,660","\"to yell and scream. They have a contractual thing of, well I don't know if it's contractual.\""]
["09:58,660","10:01,460","\"The company policy is they're allowed to leave after two minutes.\""]
["10:01,460","10:02,460","\"- Yeah. - If you're not ready to go.\""]
["10:02,460","10:04,860","\"- Yeah. - And he didn't want to do that.\""]
["10:04,860","10:07,160","\"- 'Cause it took us-- - He wanted to just sit there and be angry.\""]
["10:07,160","10:09,660","\"- I think it took us like about a minute and a half,\""]
["10:09,660","10:12,760","\"and I went out because we were just about ready to go there,\""]
["10:12,760","10:15,560","\"and I went out to talk to him, and he was just yelling,\""]
["10:15,560","10:17,860","\"and was furious, and it was just like, \"\"Okay,\""]
["10:17,860","10:20,960","\"this is why we had asked prior.\"\"\""]
["10:20,960","10:22,660","\"And if you didn't want to, that would've been fine.\""]
["10:22,660","10:24,360","\"You could've canceled the ride.\""]
["10:24,360","10:27,760","\"I would've completely understood.\""]
["10:27,760","10:31,120","\"At the same time, what a tip.\""]
["10:31,120","10:35,520","\"If he did do it, he agreed to it.\""]
["10:35,520","10:37,360","\"You don't have to yell, I'm sorry.\""]
["10:37,360","10:42,320","\"Uberman, if you're watching, I'm sorry.\""]
["10:42,320","10:45,320","\"You did not have to scream and call me the fuck word.\""]
