["07:55,880","08:02,880","\"And luckily there's a little ladder here for you to climb down.\""]
["08:02,880","08:03,880","\"Yeah!\""]
["08:03,880","08:06,880","\"Okay, and then there's a bonfire.\""]
["08:06,880","08:08,880","\"There it is.\""]
["08:08,880","08:13,880","\"And now look, all this place is, it's climbing down a tree.\""]
["08:13,880","08:16,880","\"It's not fun, it's really fucking annoying.\""]
["08:16,880","08:19,880","\"I always die, because I'm really impatient.\""]
["08:19,880","08:24,880","\"Okay, run through the old branches.\""]
["08:24,880","08:33,020","\"Oh, oh baby. Hmm. Well, what the fuck? Okay. Uh-huh\""]
["08:33,020","08:39,340","\"Okay, so you just keep running down down down\""]
["08:39,340","08:46,900","\"Okay, let's see. I don't know my way around this place because I always liked I never really cared come down here\""]
["08:46,900","08:50,260","\"Because the first time I did it. I was like that's all this down here is\""]
["08:50,260","08:53,340","\"fucking oh look\""]
["08:53,980","08:55,460","\"Oh\""]
["08:55,460","08:57,460","\"Hey, oh ah\""]
["08:57,460","09:01,140","\"What the fuck scared me no\""]
["09:01,140","09:05,020","\"They fucking saw how\""]
["09:05,020","09:15,980","\"Little bastards no no oh no oh man run through the cars run\""]
["09:15,980","09:19,900","\"God these guys scary\""]
["09:19,900","09:27,220","\"Oh fuck, get out of that.\""]
["09:27,220","09:28,220","\"Get out.\""]
["09:28,220","09:30,220","\"Oh man.\""]
["09:30,220","09:36,780","\"Did you ever see the picture of the kid online who has cancer in his eyes?\""]
["09:36,780","09:40,940","\"That's what these guys remind me of and it's really scary.\""]
["09:40,940","09:43,580","\"Sorry to bring down your day.\""]
["09:43,580","09:44,080","\"Hmm.\""]
["09:44,080","09:49,480","\"Ooh, thank you.\""]
["09:49,480","09:51,880","\"Okay, let's keep going.\""]
["09:51,880","09:54,080","\"Uh...\""]
["09:54,080","09:56,080","\"*sigh*\""]
["09:56,080","09:59,380","\"And fucking, that's another problem with Dark Souls is the camera, right?\""]
["09:59,380","10:03,480","\"Usually it's pretty good, right? Except when, like, say,\""]
["10:03,480","10:05,580","\"this is how games would usually work and it makes sense,\""]
["10:05,580","10:07,280","\"but if I try to move the camera past the street,\""]
["10:07,280","10:08,780","\"squash the camera in like that.\""]
["10:08,780","10:10,680","\"But sometimes you'll be running through like an archway\""]
["10:10,680","10:12,480","\"and the camera will, like, jolt left and right.\""]
["10:12,480","10:17,040","\"And if you're holding up, if the camera goes like that, you're gonna run off the ledge, and that happens way too often.\""]
["10:17,040","10:20,000","\"So, this place is kinda bad for that.\""]
["10:20,000","10:22,080","\"Ah!\""]
["10:22,080","10:26,480","\"I don't know how you'd fix that though, so gotta cut him some slack, I guess.\""]
["10:26,480","10:28,980","\"Mmm.\""]
["10:28,980","10:30,920","\"[laughs]\""]
["10:30,920","10:32,620","\"What do I do?\""]
