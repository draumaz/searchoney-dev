["00:59,640","01:01,480","\"How come it looks like my face?\""]
["01:01,480","01:05,080","\"'Cause it had to look really distinct on a tiny screen.\""]

["01:23,440","01:24,520","\"- No one calls it that, it's you.\""]
["01:24,520","01:26,440","\"- Like so-called zero mission.\""]
["01:26,440","01:31,960","\"You're the one that just titled it that Sam is my so-called two Samus's revenge\""]
["01:31,960","01:37,480","\"Wow wait a room the ending to the game within the first second you shitty game developers\""]
["01:37,480","01:44,240","\"How does that ruin the game by saying the title are being a woman was a big surprise for all the children back in the day\""]
["01:44,240","01:47,440","\"And now they just ruin it from the get-go, but I don't think they were gonna ever support\""]
["01:47,440","01:51,280","\"You know you never say that Samus was a lady\""]
["01:53,080","01:58,040","\"out at the end of ultimate zero mission which was the first game yeah it's\""]
["01:58,040","02:02,000","\"definitely not called ultimate zero and halfway through the game there's that\""]
["02:02,000","02:06,920","\"clever mr. X scene where her suit extends like a little thing so that she takes a\""]
["02:06,920","02:12,200","\"shit her pole up standing up yeah her prolapse extends got him pitched off now\""]
["02:12,200","02:18,200","\"that I've seen that the game's rune let's go in here but yeah Lolly you thought\""]
["02:18,200","02:20,840","\"that was a big important moment to write like when you when you first played the\""]
["02:20,840","02:25,280","\"original Metroid back in 1970. You saw that it was a pixelated woman. What went\""]
["02:25,280","02:31,720","\"through your brain? My brain said, \"\"Horny! Horny me! Horny me do!\"\" And then I\""]
["02:31,720","02:39,040","\"immediately I went and I said, \"\"Naked Samus\"\" on the on the on the on the\""]
["02:39,040","02:43,220","\"- On the 42nd count. - On the dogpile.com\""]
["02:43,220","02:45,620","\"or Ask Jeebs or whatever the hell they had back then.\""]
["02:45,620","02:47,800","\"- The dogpile, I think was one of the first\""]
["02:47,800","02:50,020","\"search engine aggregators.\""]
["02:50,020","02:53,140","\"- And it took 43 minutes and it pulled up a picture\""]
["02:53,140","02:56,700","\"of a whole nipple and I said, this is the future.\""]
["02:56,700","02:58,140","\"My wank tank is complete.\""]
["02:58,140","03:02,180","\"Also, that does look like the fraps frames per second.\""]
["03:02,180","03:03,080","\"- It really does.\""]
["03:03,080","03:07,460","\"- I think maybe fraps, stolen from Metroid Fusion.\""]
["03:07,460","03:10,660","\"- Yeah, we're making ourselves seem so old\""]
["03:10,660","03:12,020","\"with all of this, honestly.\""]
["03:12,020","03:13,340","\"- You're just mentioning fraps.\""]
["03:13,340","03:15,340","\"- Mentioning fraps, mentioning being shocked.\""]
["03:15,340","03:17,260","\"- No one uses anything other than OBS now.\""]
["03:17,260","03:19,020","\"- Samus is a woman.\""]
["03:19,020","03:21,980","\"I legitimately thought it was Samus too,\""]
["03:21,980","03:23,300","\"for the longest time.\""]
["03:23,300","03:24,140","\"- Samus.\""]
["03:24,140","03:26,340","\"- Ah, the great Samus has visited us.\""]
["03:26,340","03:28,820","\"- I just never, you know, it's one of those things\""]
["03:28,820","03:31,060","\"that you read and you never hear set out loud,\""]
["03:31,060","03:33,260","\"so I just assumed it was Samus.\""]
["03:33,260","03:35,140","\"- I'm sure I had some words like that.\""]
["03:35,140","03:37,660","\"- Same way I thought I could be, I least forgotten.\""]
["03:37,660","03:40,460","\"- Same way I thought it was Hermione.\""]
["03:40,460","03:42,460","\"- Hermione, yeah.\""]
["03:42,460","03:45,260","\"No, I think I would have read that as Hermione too.\""]
["03:45,260","03:48,180","\"If I had actually bothered reading the book\""]
["03:48,180","03:49,260","\"before seeing the movie.\""]
["03:49,260","03:50,540","\"- I don't think that's any kid's fault.\""]
["03:50,540","03:52,540","\"That's stupid British people making up silly words.\""]
["03:52,540","03:55,140","\"- Yeah, their names really are just made up.\""]
["03:55,140","03:59,020","\"- Just them and them alone.\""]
["03:59,020","04:02,780","\"- They have names like Rutger, Rutger.\""]
["04:02,780","04:03,820","\"- Billington.\""]
["04:03,820","04:04,940","\"Yeah, Churchill.\""]
["04:04,940","04:06,060","\"Idiots.\""]
["04:06,060","04:07,060","\"A lot of them.\""]
["04:07,060","04:08,500","\"Flambastrio.\""]
["04:08,500","04:09,340","\"Flanders.\""]
["04:09,340","04:11,540","\"Cobble snatch.\""]
["04:11,540","04:12,820","\"Cobble pot.\""]
["04:12,820","04:15,260","\"You cobble pots are real.\""]
["04:15,260","04:15,980","\"And isn't it?\""]
["04:15,980","04:16,980","\"It seems real.\""]
["04:16,980","04:19,980","\"Cobble pot.\""]
["04:19,980","04:21,020","\"Look what I found.\""]
["04:21,020","04:21,900","\"A big testicle.\""]
["04:21,900","04:24,860","\"I mean, it just makes me think of Batman long beam.\""]
["04:24,860","04:27,740","\"Ooh, you shined it on your testicle to kill the sperm.\""]
["04:27,740","04:30,860","\"It makes all your sperm longer.\""]
["04:30,860","04:31,420","\"Check this out.\""]
["04:31,420","04:33,220","\"I don't know what you think the long beam does,\""]
["04:33,220","04:35,220","\"But it does that oh\""]
["04:35,220","04:40,180","\"That's different from your other beam well you should just kind of just fizzle out halfway through at the screen\""]
["04:40,180","04:42,340","\"Oh, I see oh so this one now\""]
["04:42,340","04:47,460","\"It's considered long because it makes it all the way across your your hundred pixel wide screen\""]
["04:47,460","04:49,700","\"Yeah, you can do that see it's weird that that's an upgrade\""]
["04:49,700","04:54,660","\"They give it to you so early to that it might as well not have been that's not very nice\""]
["04:54,660","05:00,820","\"New where to go and you just want to do the idea of upgrades at this point. Okay, that's fair\""]
["05:00,820","05:04,860","\"You don't have to put me on blast like that dude learn a basic game design\""]
["05:04,860","05:11,420","\"Oh, I'm kind of learn some game design mechanics perhaps maybe when you're gonna make the sanity not included video game\""]
["05:11,420","05:15,620","\"Then you'll know what the fuck you're talking about that was a thing at one point. Yeah\""]
["05:15,620","05:21,460","\"No, it was we were we were trying to make something that was kind of similar to punch out or something scrunch out\""]
["05:21,460","05:27,620","\"But I don't think anybody involved in actually putting it together knew what they were doing\""]
["05:29,620","05:34,900","\"Punch out game it really does feel like it would have like no a lot less complicated\""]
["05:34,900","05:37,940","\"Programming but a lot of pressure would be on that\""]
["05:37,940","05:42,600","\"Sort of on the animators and just the fine-tuning of like making it feel good\""]
["05:42,600","05:46,900","\"Yeah, we had kind of like a punch it was like\""]
["05:46,900","05:50,260","\"kind of\""]
["05:50,260","05:56,780","\"Horizontal instead of like dead on the idea was you would like crouch and jump instead of like we've left and right\""]
["05:57,420","06:04,220","\"So it was still more of like a like a side side kind of but it was built around like your character doesn't really move\""]
["06:04,220","06:09,020","\"You just kind of like dodge in various ways, but it was it was so like mismanaged\""]
["06:09,020","06:10,220","\"I\""]
["06:10,220","06:12,220","\"Don't think there was ever really a developer\""]
["06:12,220","06:15,860","\"Involved it was it was just machinima kind of blindly\""]
["06:15,860","06:20,160","\"Saying like we're gonna do this. That's what every YouTube network was\""]
["06:20,160","06:25,100","\"It was just a bunch of people who didn't know anything and who made a bunch of promises that they knew they could never keep\""]
["06:25,740","06:27,300","\"Rock honestly\""]
["06:27,300","06:33,460","\"Yeah, I miss that I miss being promised things that I never get me - at least I had the promises\""]
["06:33,460","06:37,100","\"That's something right. Oh this room runs like shit\""]
["06:37,100","06:40,940","\"That's the the challenge setting in\""]
["06:40,940","06:47,340","\"Hey, uh, emulator coders get your shit together because how else am I supposed to steal games?\""]
["06:47,340","06:48,860","\"I mean\""]
["06:48,860","06:53,860","\"Emulator coders maybe call my dad on the phone and tell him that he was wrong about me\""]
["06:54,820","06:59,560","\"Just so you know, I bought this fucking game when I was like 12 so each shit. I own it\""]
["06:59,560","07:07,300","\"Yeah, the digital Millennium copyright act here protects Chris and his right to own a legal backup copy and a firearm\""]
["07:07,300","07:09,300","\"To shoot people who try to steal me to jail\""]
["07:09,300","07:15,720","\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's one of your nail-able rights. I know that those words came out in the wrong order, but\""]
["07:15,720","07:19,500","\"It's like I like the way it sounded\""]
["07:20,340","07:23,540","\"That's like a kids book. That's how you\""]
["07:23,540","07:27,640","\"Description in the kids book and it makes the kids go that this wings you cool\""]
["07:27,640","07:31,980","\"Does the missile take action give you missiles? Oh, okay? You can fire missiles. What do you think?\""]
["07:31,980","07:36,140","\"Dunkey, that's my favorite children's book. Does the missile tank actually?\""]
["07:36,140","07:40,820","\"I'm just saying in a lot of games you actually have to collect a missile launcher to get missiles\""]
["07:40,820","07:46,400","\"You're not enough to just have them. Check this out. Check this out. Check this out. Check this out. Check this out\""]
["07:46,400","07:49,100","\"Your mom\""]
["07:49,260","07:51,020","\"nipple flaunter\""]
["07:51,020","07:57,300","\"Kill that thing. Yeah. Oh my god. It's running so badly shoot missiles in its eye for looking at you\""]
["07:57,300","08:00,020","\"I am\""]
["08:00,020","08:02,020","\"Samus ah\""]
["08:02,020","08:05,820","\"No, I do like that effect where the missile just go\""]
["08:05,820","08:09,380","\"The wrong thing just deflates. Yeah, I\""]
["08:09,380","08:13,940","\"Mean it's pretty impressive the music's keeping up while the game's not\""]
["08:13,940","08:17,980","\"You son of a fucking bitch now I'm screwed\""]
["08:18,740","08:24,340","\"Do you have no missiles? I don't think you need missiles to defeat him. I can beat him later. Oh, it just leaves\""]
["08:24,340","08:29,640","\"You alone. Oh, it just detects that you sound winnable for you and just leaves. Yeah, I should have beat him there\""]
["08:29,640","08:36,280","\"That's easy. I think does it have guilt is that why it left you on your lonesome? Well, I shot it twice\""]
["08:36,280","08:38,280","\"It is pretty\""]
["08:38,280","08:43,460","\"It's actually has it can feel like about four times more emotions than Samus Aaron can\""]
["08:43,900","08:49,380","\"Sorry Samus there's crazy shit like that like whales where they're like they are scared\""]
["08:49,380","08:57,900","\"I remember you don't don't like doesn't like the part of the part of their brain that feels emotions on like elephants and whales like way bigger than ours\""]
["08:57,900","09:04,740","\"Yeah, there's scream big deala. There's scream. They're screaming. They're like we use to scream, but they use for so much more\""]
["09:04,740","09:08,300","\"This room's purple and junk\""]
["09:08,300","09:10,060","\"Yeah\""]
["09:10,060","09:17,620","\"That does tend to happen in places like this. Does that make it more immersive of like an alien planet than the purple?\""]
["09:17,620","09:23,580","\"Yeah, I think the idea was to just pick a cusp a color that contrasted really hard with Samus's armor\""]
["09:23,580","09:29,980","\"No, it's cuz on alien planets everything's purple. Oh, okay. Think about it earth green-blue\""]
["09:29,980","09:32,780","\"aliens purple\""]
["09:32,780","09:37,820","\"Get it. That is a color you don't see a lot of nature except in this example and in this one\""]
["09:37,820","09:40,020","\"And this one and this one and this one and this one\""]
["09:40,020","09:45,120","\"Except for like purple flowers and like it's purple people in the California\""]
["09:45,120","09:50,180","\"They are purple and purple grape purple and their real sons of bitches\""]
["09:50,180","09:55,480","\"Oh God these little things are kicking my ass to be fair the camera's not really helping me there come on\""]
["09:55,480","09:56,940","\"I'll make you joke\""]
["09:56,940","10:00,320","\"Fine it's almost like Christopher Nolan's directing\""]
["10:00,320","10:06,860","\"You said the camera's not helping I was talking about the nutsack, but okay. Oh that joke\""]
["10:06,860","10:09,760","\"Yeah, oh that looks like my scrot. Okay. Thank you\""]
["10:09,760","10:15,940","\"39 oh fuck you little bats fuck you give me that they're gonna kill you no\""]
["10:15,940","10:21,940","\"See too bad none of them dropped health\""]
["10:21,940","10:28,420","\"Did you see did you see Christopher Nolan is just being a being a real one lately? What's he doing?\""]
["10:28,420","10:32,980","\"Oh, yeah, he's like fucking like really really angry that\""]
["10:33,660","10:35,660","\"People aren't going to movie theaters\""]
["10:35,660","10:38,060","\"How dare you?\""]
["10:38,060","10:42,860","\"He's pissed off and he's like he's real mad at the easy taking it personally. Yes\""]
["10:42,860","10:46,660","\"He's real mad at the HBO Max thing. He said something like\""]
["10:46,660","10:54,500","\"Imagine going to bed thinking your movie is gonna be shown on a cinema screen and finding out you're on a streaming service\""]
["10:54,500","11:02,580","\"Such as sounds like the end of the fucking world. He sounds like a problem that just anybody can relate to he added some fucking colorful\""]
["11:02,580","11:08,340","\"language in there too but I forget what he fucking said but yeah it was like I don't\""]
["11:08,340","11:12,420","\"know Christopher Nolan's movies I specifically fucking avoid in the theater because he's like\""]
["11:12,420","11:17,140","\"how about I rip your goddamn ears off oopsie Christopher Nolan said that yeah Christopher\""]
["11:17,140","11:24,180","\"Nolan said you Chris are a prick I'd say the memento sucks in that you think the memento\""]

["11:33,140","11:38,100","\"Say you think that would get to it. That's you admitting you're just being contrarian\""]
["11:38,100","11:42,980","\"So you just finally you want to attack the man at this foundation? I can respect that\""]
["11:42,980","11:47,980","\"I feel like he'd be like what the fuck why did he say that why it put me on the map?\""]
["11:47,980","11:51,360","\"Yeah, give me my charge beam already. Oh, yes. Oh, yes\""]

["12:11,360","12:18,060","\"Like different countries and shit. Yeah taking down different countries. They bomb Siberia\""]
["12:18,060","12:23,040","\"It took Siberia Poland and now they're going to invade Ireland next which is kind of a bummer for me\""]
["12:23,040","12:27,140","\"To be fair to them. I never even knew about that\""]
["12:27,140","12:30,140","\"To be fair though, Ocarina of Time was a masterpiece.\""]

["12:31,900","12:34,260","\"- Yeah, but not even a fucking idiot.\""]
["12:34,260","12:36,180","\"- But it's not 1998 anymore,\""]
["12:36,180","12:38,020","\"so maybe they should try something new, huh?\""]
["12:38,020","12:40,020","\"- Well, maybe it should be 1998 again.\""]
["12:40,020","12:42,340","\"- Did that come out in '98?\""]
["12:42,340","12:43,860","\"- I think you either nailed it\""]

["13:17,300","13:20,140","\"That's amazing how you keep doing that.\""]
["13:20,140","13:24,140","\"Yeah, November 1998 was the US release.\""]
["13:24,140","13:25,300","\"Oh, all right.\""]

["13:38,500","13:39,580","\"Oh, I did.\""]
["13:39,580","13:43,980","\"Well, yeah, Nintendo 64 and Super Nintendo and all those,\""]
["13:43,980","13:45,940","\"they stored the data on the cartridge.\""]
["13:45,940","13:49,460","\"Yeah, no, you sometimes you get some random person save data,\""]
["13:49,460","13:53,420","\"either at Blockbuster or just like, yeah, getting, getting used stuff.\""]
["13:53,420","13:55,740","\"I remember when I played Ocarina of Time,\""]
["13:55,780","14:00,100","\"I had this crazy, like, the guy did everything.\""]
["14:00,100","14:02,200","\"So I got this weird crazy preview\""]
["14:02,200","14:03,900","\"of what the end of the game was gonna be like.\""]
["14:03,900","14:05,780","\"So I saw like, Link was an adult,\""]
["14:05,780","14:07,220","\"and he was wearing a red tunic,\""]
["14:07,220","14:08,540","\"and he had a big sword, and I was like,\""]
["14:08,540","14:09,380","\"\"\"He ruined the whole game for you.\"\"\""]
["14:09,380","14:10,460","\"- What the fuck?\""]
["14:10,460","14:12,980","\"- I, in a way it made it cool though,\""]
["14:12,980","14:15,100","\"because I was like this little bitch with a knife,\""]
["14:15,100","14:17,420","\"and I was like, \"\"When do I become the cool guy\""]
["14:17,420","14:18,780","\"\"\"with the big sword?\"\"\""]
["14:18,780","14:20,060","\"- Did I ever tell you this story about\""]
["14:20,060","14:22,060","\"when I first saw Link to the past?\""]
["14:22,060","14:22,900","\"- No.\""]
["14:22,900","14:27,060","\"It was like the first house we ever got in Atlanta\""]
["14:27,060","14:30,140","\"and it belonged to the Japanese family.\""]
["14:30,140","14:34,300","\"And their son, I just remember like,\""]
["14:34,300","14:37,460","\"my parents were looking around and like,\""]
["14:37,460","14:38,860","\"they were like, this would be your room.\""]
["14:38,860","14:40,580","\"And I like walked inside and like,\""]
["14:40,580","14:42,340","\"their son was just sitting there\""]
["14:42,340","14:43,860","\"and he was playing like,\""]
["14:43,860","14:46,780","\"he had like the Japanese super famicom,\""]
["14:46,780","14:48,780","\"which I looked at and instantly was like,\""]
["14:48,780","14:51,660","\"why does that look so much cooler than the American one?\""]
["14:51,660","14:55,220","\"But then also, like, he was playing that game\""]
["14:55,220","14:59,020","\"and it was still like a year from release in the US.\""]
["14:59,020","15:02,740","\"And I was just like, this is what Zelda looks like in Japan.\""]
["15:02,740","15:05,780","\"And like, like when I played the game like years later,\""]
["15:05,780","15:08,220","\"I'm like, this is the same fucking game.\""]
["15:08,220","15:09,060","\"I don't know.\""]
["15:09,060","15:10,060","\"- So you were like chasing the dragon of it?\""]
["15:10,060","15:12,020","\"- That's not really interesting in story.\""]
["15:12,020","15:15,580","\"But it was an exciting moment for me to just like happen\""]
["15:15,580","15:19,380","\"to get this glimpse into like a pre-release title\""]
["15:19,380","15:22,640","\"Entirely by accident because of a house I moved into\""]
["15:22,640","15:27,800","\"That is cool. Yeah Japanese to US releases used to be way way off\""]
["15:27,800","15:32,080","\"Like it used to be came out in Japan and then came out in the US like two years later\""]
["15:32,080","15:37,340","\"Yep, when I was a teenager I played all the Zelda's\""]
["15:37,340","15:42,860","\"Like ocarina time and win waker and then a link to the past came out on Game Boy Advance\""]
["15:42,860","15:45,780","\"I was like oh, this is cool. This is a new Zelda game\""]
["15:45,780","15:51,700","\"I thought it was brand new and when I played it I couldn't get over how much I hated the sound of the instruments and the music\""]
["15:51,700","15:54,620","\"It was like this sounds like fucking ass. What does it sound so gross?\""]
["15:54,620","16:01,720","\"Well for one the Game Boy Advance has a really bad sound chip so it wasn't helping but I remember the French horn sound effect pissed me off\""]
["16:01,720","16:06,380","\"Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about. It's so ugly the list that it's very\""]
["16:06,380","16:07,700","\"I\""]
["16:07,700","16:11,860","\"Don't know how to describe it other than it makes you feel like you have a fever or something\""]
["16:11,860","16:15,740","\"I just I really don't like it for some reason. It just sounds so ugly\""]
["16:15,740","16:18,920","\"You're talking about\""]
["16:18,920","16:30,520","\"Yeah, it's just something about it it is I kind of in agreement even though there are some good tracks in that game\""]
["16:30,520","16:34,760","\"Oh, no music is beautiful, but it's just that one sample is when I hear it\""]
["16:34,760","16:40,200","\"It's like why couldn't you be any other sample in the entire world do you mind the SNES version of the same one really?\""]
["16:40,200","16:45,240","\"The Game Boy Advance one is more and what has more of that like hiss in it because it's game boy\""]
["16:45,240","16:50,600","\"That's a shitty tiny speaker. Well the Game Boy Advance just has just weird hisses over every sample\""]
["16:50,600","16:55,160","\"Even in the emulator do you sort of still the cannot hear it listen? I guess you're right\""]
["16:55,160","17:02,200","\"You can hear that buzz. There's definitely like a tooth on everything. Yeah to the bright warm money\""]
["17:02,200","17:05,000","\"creamy stinky\""]
["17:08,760","17:15,800","\"The two says in like the wave like this like this like the the sign curve or whatever the fuck yes\""]
["17:15,800","17:21,240","\"It's a fluffy fuzzy it would literally look like it had a little fucking like\""]
["17:21,240","17:25,160","\"Like saw teeth on it red and meanie mac and cheese\""]
["17:25,160","17:32,720","\"Stavod sound in the entire room. I'll just shut up\""]
["17:32,720","17:38,340","\"I'm not it. You know what I use those words cuz I'm a bit. Oh see this room\""]
["17:38,340","17:46,940","\"You knew I knew I knew you old Wow now how am I supposed to get in here?\""]
["17:46,940","17:51,620","\"It's like you'd need some kind of cool grappling beam shit\""]
["17:51,620","17:57,080","\"You know what you know what game the Japanese version actually like is totally different of and kind of rocks\""]
["17:57,080","18:01,660","\"What you've ever played Donkey Konga. I love that game. Yeah, I like Donkey Kong\""]
["18:01,660","18:06,940","\"Interesting concept for a rhythm game, but uh\""]
["18:07,980","18:12,460","\"The songs that they picked for it. I think that they literally just went what's the cheapest?\""]
["18:12,460","18:15,920","\"Thing that was on the radio that we could license\""]
["18:15,920","18:21,080","\"So you're playing like rock lobster and stuff like that. That's a great song\""]
["18:21,080","18:29,480","\"We had a friend from Japan and the Japanese version of that game has like this crazy soundtrack of these real sick like\""]
["18:29,480","18:32,820","\"Japanese like metal songs and shit like that and\""]
["18:34,140","18:37,880","\"Yeah, it's very different. I mean obviously something like that\""]
["18:37,880","18:42,500","\"You don't a rhythm game the soundtrack really does make or break the game usually\""]
["18:42,500","18:46,640","\"You know what I feel like DDR has a lot of weird Japanese music on it\""]
["18:46,640","18:51,780","\"And they just were like screw it. I thought most of it was like European music. Oh, I mean I could be wrong\""]
["18:51,780","18:54,940","\"It's a lot of like euro beat shit like Captain Jack and\""]
["18:54,940","19:01,420","\"That's a good sound like Stan Bush. Did I really don't know what Stan Bush like\""]
["19:01,860","19:08,100","\"Was the guy that like I don't know if he made music for Japan because like all the initial D stuff\""]
["19:08,100","19:13,700","\"I think is by him unless I'm thinking of the wrong guy. He told me it's what maybe that's not Stan Bush\""]
["19:13,700","19:22,740","\"Maybe Stan Bush is the guy who did the sent transformers 1989 sound tracks him. Oh, okay. I'm thinking of the wrong guy not Stan Bush\""]
["19:22,740","19:26,260","\"He did something Rogers or\""]
["19:27,260","19:29,260","\"Mr.\""]
["19:29,260","19:32,260","\"Who did all the initial D songs that are super memorable?\""]
["19:32,260","19:34,260","\"Stinky Rogers? I have no idea.\""]
["19:34,260","19:36,260","\"Ugly Rogers.\""]
["19:36,260","19:38,260","\"You're talking about like running in the 90s and shit, right?\""]
["19:38,260","19:40,260","\"Yeah, stuff like that.\""]
["19:40,260","19:41,260","\"Nasty Rogers.\""]
["19:41,260","19:44,260","\"Like space boy and like Dave Rogers.\""]
["19:44,260","19:46,260","\"That's who I was trying to think of.\""]
["19:46,260","19:48,260","\"Not Stan Bush.\""]
["19:48,260","19:50,260","\"He was Italian.\""]
["19:50,260","19:52,260","\"So that is like Eurobeats.\""]
["19:52,260","19:54,260","\"Save please.\""]
["19:54,260","19:58,560","\"I really want to figure out why it's slowing down. It's pissing me off honestly\""]
["19:58,560","20:06,360","\"What if you loaded up your euro beat playlist and then a Spotify said euro beat more like euro beats?\""]
["20:06,360","20:08,860","\"Samus would say\""]
["20:08,860","20:13,060","\"She would jiggle her back leg and her back fat\""]
["20:13,060","20:18,260","\"Yeah, her leg goes back, but yeah, but her torso and front legs stay completely stationary\""]
["20:18,260","20:22,520","\"So like Miyamoto goes up to the guy doing the sprite so when she aims up\""]
["20:22,520","20:26,600","\"I want you to make her get into a cool pose and like look up and then be all dramatic\""]
["20:26,600","20:33,080","\"And then the guy just like selects her back leg and moves a back epixel then he gets fired and he gets sent a fucking\""]
["20:33,080","20:36,280","\"Sword to kill himself. He gets sent to a work camp. Yeah\""]
["20:36,280","20:42,040","\"One of those famous Nintendo work camps. Why would they put purple bugs in space?\""]
["20:42,040","20:47,560","\"Uh, maybe they didn't put them there. Maybe that's just where they were born. What happened to your whole purple thesis\""]
["20:47,560","20:52,440","\"That's just go out the window. Yeah. Yeah, I thought we had this discussion. I mean their bugs not alien stupid\""]
["20:52,440","21:00,440","\"Holy n-box. No, they're just simple regular Pokemon. No. I got a missile tank.\""]
["21:00,440","21:06,440","\"Ain't you proud? I sure am son. Tanks dead. Oh my god!\""]
["21:06,440","21:10,440","\"What am I supposed to do? Can you blow that up while you're in the lava?\""]
["21:10,440","21:15,440","\"Ouchy ouchy ouchy. Oh no! Well you can. This is a horrible idea. I don't think\""]
["21:15,440","21:19,440","\"you're equipped for this area. Oh yeah. Do that Chris. Oh you told me to\""]
["21:19,440","21:24,060","\"I'm stupid and I'm gonna go listen to me now. We gotta go back. We gotta go back see you lives\""]
["21:24,060","21:47,500","\"I can't believe she went all the way to the l\""]
["21:47,500","21:50,780","\"I'm gonna fall all the way down again.\""]

["22:01,020","22:02,020","\"Get out of here.\""]
["22:02,020","22:03,020","\"I need some more health.\""]

["22:05,020","22:06,020","\"Oh.\""]
["22:06,020","22:08,360","\"That was after you.\""]
["22:08,360","22:11,780","\"You said that this was your favorite game and you've played it a million times.\""]
["22:11,780","22:15,420","\"It's true that you know like the back of your hand and no one should ever try to give\""]
["22:15,420","22:20,940","\"any help under any circumstances. You specifically said, oh, it wants me to go to North. Yeah,\""]
["22:20,940","22:27,820","\"just go down that big long shaft. Well, we got an extra space clamp missile tank, so we're fine.\""]
["22:27,820","22:37,180","\"Stupid little spiketies. Spikadoos. Can I get back here? Why did you do that? Yeah. Oh, there you go.\""]
["22:37,180","22:43,980","\"Now you can just roll on through. I don't know how productive that was, but it was weird. Honestly,\""]
["22:44,620","22:49,900","\"Let me out. Damn you. So I'm just gonna go all the way down down to Goblin Town.\""]
["22:49,900","22:53,800","\"Down the goblin town. Down the goblin town. Down the goblin town. Down the goblin town.\""]
["22:53,800","23:01,980","\"The only 2D Metroid I've ever played is, uh... Fusion. I heard that was a good one. I never played it. I liked it.\""]
["23:01,980","23:09,060","\"Uh, everyone this year, and specifically this year, I don't know why it's starting to say that Metroid... Super Metroid is an overrated piece of shit.\""]
["23:09,060","23:14,420","\"Really? Yeah, it's like the new thing of your... That's the new hot take? Yeah. That's the new Think Piece.\""]
["23:14,420","23:19,700","\"I think it might be a little true because every time I've tried playing it I get bored within like I think it's\""]
["23:19,700","23:23,540","\"I think it's completely unfair like hindsight kind of thing\""]
["23:23,540","23:29,860","\"Yeah, I'm sure at the time though. It was like amazing, but now it feels dated to go go back to it because so many people\""]
["23:29,860","23:34,100","\"Have taken their formula and improved on it by now that it just feels like a good point\""]
["23:34,100","23:39,380","\"Yeah, like yeah, I feel like there's a lot of things like that where something is really really influential\""]
["23:39,380","23:43,420","\"And then the things that it inspired kind of make it feel obsolete\""]
["23:43,660","23:48,580","\"Look, it's a pixel brain. I personally felt that way trying to play an original Harvest Moon game\""]
["23:48,580","23:51,500","\"Like Stardew Valley did everything they did better\""]
["23:51,500","23:59,100","\"Yeah, so to the point that then even the new Harvest Moon games just feel lazy by comparison because one guy with an indie studio\""]
["23:59,100","24:06,180","\"Did a better job than like a whole team with like corporate financing? It's look over on head\""]
["24:06,180","24:09,780","\"Yeah, Stardew Valley is one of those games that just updates forever though, right?\""]
["24:09,780","24:14,820","\"I feel like that was definitely their rap. I don't know if they still do or not because I haven't played\""]
["24:14,820","24:19,300","\"But yeah, they they like went and fully added like like multiplayer co-op to the game\""]
["24:19,300","24:21,300","\"Just like casually after its release\""]
["24:21,300","24:26,660","\"Something that a lot of other games like when people ask for multiplayer you get a whole like\""]
["24:26,660","24:32,420","\"Connection fit and like a heart game was not designed or a multiplayer. Do you want me to read?\""]
["24:32,420","24:34,860","\"And it's just like they're just like oh yeah, we added it in\""]
["24:36,340","24:42,900","\"Yeah, I honestly think games if they can add it just as a stupid player tooth thing if they can do it\""]
["24:42,900","24:44,900","\"Why not if it breaks the game?\""]
["24:44,900","24:52,980","\"Just like make it an extra mode after you beat the main game. Yeah. Yeah, what in the actual hell happened to fucking co-op games?\""]
["24:52,980","24:59,500","\"They don't make as much money is slapping ads and bullshit. Yeah, hang on\""]
["25:00,420","25:08,120","\"Like also, yeah, most even most multiplayer games made to this day are built only with like a network stack in mind and no like couch co-op\""]
["25:08,120","25:10,920","\"Yeah, look I remember back in the day\""]
["25:10,920","25:15,420","\"Every shooter or whatever you have like a good a co-op mode\""]
["25:15,420","25:20,780","\"You know like your Gears of Wars and your halos and shit like that and then it just stopped dude\""]

["25:26,700","25:31,500","\"I played the demo, but man it was so insanely good. I was really\""]
["25:31,500","25:37,980","\"It was the first game to have like really fucking monstrous bosses, right? Yeah, at least one of the first\""]
["25:37,980","25:45,960","\"It's one of those games that like the PC version used game spy so it's unplayable now. Oh, which is kind of bullshit\""]
["25:45,960","25:52,220","\"Yeah, I all the stuff that used game spy as like a way around having to engineer their own like network stack\""]
["25:52,220","25:55,300","\"Which I can't blame them for doing but yeah\""]
["25:55,300","26:00,780","\"It sucks that like now none of those games are like natively playable multiplayer. You have to like oh\""]
["26:00,780","26:04,860","\"Some some community member has to like develop a hack around it\""]
["26:04,860","26:08,740","\"Yeah, but it was really fucking cool. Oh fuck\""]
["26:08,740","26:14,820","\"There you go. It's like you you have like a grappling hook and your character is very uh, I\""]
["26:14,820","26:21,640","\"Don't know the word like jumpy like you can like stick to things and grapple the things like your your character feels very\""]

["26:27,560","26:29,840","\"and you know, things like that.\""]
["26:29,840","26:31,800","\"And it kind of has a little bit of like,\""]
["26:31,800","26:35,200","\"like a shadow of the Colossus, like Monster Hunter style.\""]
["26:35,200","26:37,840","\"Like I can clamor around on this thing,\""]
["26:37,840","26:40,520","\"sort of deal with the bosses and stuff.\""]
["26:40,520","26:41,560","\"It's real neat.\""]
["26:41,560","26:43,400","\"Like there's a boss that, Tomar,\""]
["26:43,400","26:45,760","\"you probably fought this one if you played the demo\""]

["26:55,120","26:55,960","\"- That's what the demo was.\""]
["26:55,960","26:58,240","\"- And like hammer that thing back out.\""]
["26:58,240","27:00,440","\"So like you could have people shooting it\""]

["27:20,160","27:21,840","\"I'm just gonna check down here real quick.\""]
["27:21,840","27:23,900","\"- Like the last time I tried to play it,\""]

["27:27,060","27:29,240","\"Like that's how integrated it was.\""]

["27:30,400","27:31,240","\"- Yeah.\""]
["27:31,240","27:34,140","\"Wasn't GameSpy like an evil virus?\""]
["27:34,140","27:38,120","\"- I think it was to prevent evil viruses.\""]
["27:38,120","27:40,280","\"- But then it turned out to be like some kind of evil virus\""]
["27:40,280","27:42,080","\"that like sucked the fucking credit cards off\""]

["27:44,960","27:46,920","\"- No, I swear, I swear GameSpy went under\""]
["27:46,920","27:48,200","\"for like some weird nefarious reason.\""]
["27:48,200","27:52,400","\"I do feel like Game Spy did at least have some some PR disaster\""]
["27:52,400","27:56,680","\"I don't know if it ever turned out to be true or not, but it was definitely enough to like that's what I remember\""]
["27:56,680","28:01,960","\"I remember brand I think people just kind of didn't like it because it was an additional DRM\""]
["28:01,960","28:07,640","\"I mean you could be right. I just didn't have an part of it. Tomer's looking at I'm googling Game Spy scandal\""]
["28:07,640","28:12,920","\"Yeah, see what comes up and fucking report back. Oh, I fucking love this see this right here\""]
["28:12,920","28:14,920","\"Yeah, check this out. You get this thing\""]
["28:14,920","28:18,600","\"It's like what the fuck it's an unknown item. What the fuck?\""]

["28:23,680","28:26,920","\"Incompatible with current suit you're like, oh man. What the fuck is that?\""]
["28:26,920","28:34,100","\"But let's you get out for now does this whatever the fuck yeah, I keep this keeps leading back to the classic Kane and Lynch game spot\""]
["28:34,100","28:36,100","\"scandal I\""]
["28:36,100","28:40,980","\"Love to blame and splench game spy. I guess is just close enough to game spot\""]
["28:41,720","28:48,400","\"That is one of the I think that was one of the most publicized like gaming industry scandals of all time\""]
["28:48,400","28:50,240","\"it was that\""]
["28:50,240","28:52,160","\"like\""]
["28:52,160","28:55,680","\"Everybody was giving the new Kane and Lynch game fucking terrible reviews\""]
["28:55,680","29:00,640","\"I didn't and he got huge shit over it right or got fired or something. That's what it was\""]
["29:00,640","29:01,360","\"No, that's right\""]
["29:01,360","29:05,800","\"He didn't give them a good review and then they fired him and at the exact same time\""]
["29:05,800","29:10,720","\"They were running like like huge like site wrapper ads for Kane and Lynch -\""]
["29:11,440","29:16,960","\"And they clearly had like some backroom deal where they were trying to force him to write a favorable review\""]
["29:16,960","29:21,920","\"And then that guy started giant bomb right maybe I don't I don't actually know where that went\""]
["29:21,920","29:32,080","\"But could be the case now I'm stuck in the fucking eagle hole. Yeah get I actually never had any sort of um\""]
["29:32,080","29:40,800","\"I never had any sort of like guidelines for pregame discharge like they never were like you can't you can't be the only time they ever\""]
["29:40,800","29:46,640","\"They ever were like you can't put that in there was there was a point where I\""]
["29:46,640","29:55,520","\"Said that like I want to said something. Oh really? Yeah, and they were like you we've gotten in trouble for attributing a quote to a dead guy before\""]
["29:55,520","29:58,840","\"So don't do that. That's the only time they ever told me you can't do that\""]
["29:58,840","30:05,720","\"But like I do feel like there is a thing with game journalism where it's very heavily like fuck\""]
["30:05,720","30:09,520","\"Integrated with advertising for video games\""]
["30:10,120","30:13,800","\"Because it's their only source of revenue other than like\""]
["30:13,800","30:16,920","\"Yeah, I get membership programs if you think about it\""]
["30:16,920","30:21,160","\"It it makes sense right because it's like press revolving around a product\""]
["30:21,160","30:30,200","\"But it's it is definitely a built-in flaw when you're supposed to be trusting these companies for for like opinions on on whether a game's worth buying\""]
["30:30,200","30:32,520","\"Yeah, that's very true and they can be bought off\""]
["30:32,520","30:38,120","\"Yeah, bought off or like in they don't even necessarily need to be bought off\""]
["30:38,120","30:41,960","\"I feel like most of them aren't but what they do get is you know\""]
["30:41,960","30:47,800","\"Oh, we're gonna not send you review codes anymore because you gave our game a bad review or something like that\""]
["30:47,800","30:51,160","\"Like I know Bethesda back in the day was infamous for doing that\""]

["32:35,620","32:36,620","\"I mean, I don't know.\""]

["32:41,420","32:42,720","\"I don't think so.\""]

["32:56,220","33:00,860","\"Yeah, no, so on the GTA server you can like pick and choose every single NPC in the game\""]

["33:15,220","33:19,820","\"But then go like crazy with adding personality to them by like painting on to them and shit\""]
["33:19,820","33:24,340","\"Yeah, rockstar was one of those like very detail oriented companies from the beginning\""]

["33:53,340","34:00,060","\"Yeah, they've been I assume they're yeah, they're publicly traded because they're part of Activision now like are they\""]

["34:03,900","34:12,500","\"Oh, yeah, that's true because Blizzard used to also have a reputation for being like a super like like white glove like detail oriented company\""]
["34:12,500","34:16,300","\"And then they became the worst enemies ever and I mean yeah\""]
["34:16,300","34:22,660","\"I mean World of Warcraft became another like pay-to-play kind of game now as far as I know can I get up there?\""]

["37:07,220","37:09,220","\"So he just kind of took the Gweifen rant.\""]
["37:09,220","37:10,580","\"- What is my understanding?\""]
["37:10,580","37:11,420","\"- Can't blame him.\""]
["37:11,420","37:13,020","\"I would have done the same damn thing.\""]
["37:13,020","37:14,340","\"- What an actual hero.\""]
["37:14,340","37:15,860","\"- There's weird stuff like that though.\""]
["37:15,860","37:19,580","\"Like some of the cards I guess had like weird effects.\""]
["37:19,580","37:22,860","\"So there was one card where it was like some stupid gimmick\""]
["37:22,860","37:24,700","\"where you literally dropped the card\""]
["37:24,700","37:26,980","\"and if it landed on something,\""]
["37:26,980","37:29,940","\"like that card got destroyed or something.\""]
["37:29,940","37:32,180","\"And it became a really, really powerful\""]
["37:32,180","37:34,580","\"and a really rare magic card because--\""]
["37:34,580","37:36,860","\"- Sounds like one that would get banned really quickly.\""]
["37:36,860","37:40,540","\"- Well, it was a problem that sorted itself out\""]
["37:40,540","37:45,140","\"because what happened with it was people started tearing them up\""]
["37:45,140","37:47,260","\"and throwing them all over the table\""]
["37:47,260","37:48,620","\"'cause there's nothing in the rules that says\""]
["37:48,620","37:50,060","\"you can't do that.\""]
["37:50,060","37:53,620","\"So technically they would be able to like--\""]

["37:56,020","37:58,880","\"- The opponent's entire field.\""]
["37:58,880","38:02,700","\"But because of that, the card ended up really, really rare\""]
["38:02,700","38:05,380","\"because they were getting destroyed in every tournament.\""]
["38:05,380","38:08,580","\"And obviously they were like, yeah, this card's stupid.\""]
["38:08,580","38:10,300","\"We're not making more of it.\""]

["38:27,260","38:29,180","\"- Tripping was a spite move.\""]
["38:29,180","38:30,020","\"- I thought it was.\""]
["38:30,020","38:32,020","\"It was like a spite move against people who wanted\""]

["38:34,020","38:37,740","\"Yeah, because Sakurai was like, this is a game for but babies.\""]

["40:29,540","40:37,000","\"Yeah, but to at least encourage the tournaments themselves rather than endorse individual players seems like the way to go\""]
["40:37,000","40:43,720","\"Yeah, I mean it's just in the smash scene. There were people that were like smash celebrities\""]
["40:43,720","40:49,260","\"You know no, I've definitely like and they were all talking to 15 year olds every single one\""]

["44:57,700","45:03,040","\"Oh, this music's so good because Ridley's is like a wanted space pirate. That's the whole thing\""]
["45:03,040","45:09,160","\"Like you think of him as just a monster, but yeah, they always refer to him as a space pirate. Yeah, oh he commands them in shit\""]
["45:09,160","45:15,200","\"But yeah, when you see him he's just like a fire breathing dragon that screams. Yeah, that's honestly really cool. I didn't know that\""]

["45:57,600","45:58,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["45:58,600","46:02,960","\"games, that's not the case where if you talk about the villain from the start and don't\""]

["46:06,800","46:11,240","\"crazy shit he does, it really builds up for a good final boss.\""]
["46:11,240","46:12,240","\"That is true.\""]
["46:12,240","46:19,240","\"Yeah, because I feel like media now has this problem where they like over humanize villains\""]

["46:24,440","46:28,440","\"That's not always necessary, especially if you just want to make them scary.\""]
["46:28,440","46:34,560","\"Yeah, like when they try like making shit like Freddy and Jason like they try to give him a human size like I don't care\""]

["46:43,440","46:52,240","\"I do like the idea of believable villains but believable and like human or sympathetic are very like there's a pretty thick line between them\""]
["46:52,240","46:57,520","\"Yeah, I think it also depends on what you're going for like a thick lot, but there's plenty of room for like\""]
["46:57,520","47:00,040","\"Like if you want one without the idea\""]
["47:00,040","47:06,600","\"I'll g driven ville and like magneto is like a good example of something that's like you see where he's coming from\""]
