["10:11,720","10:18,000","\"Don't remember doing that. I guess because when I played on the M64 this didn't take very long\""]
["10:18,000","10:26,100","\"Okay, you got him. Okay. He got you. That's the end of it. You're dead brothers. It's all right. It spits you right back out\""]

["10:47,840","10:50,840","\"Quick at him\""]
["10:50,840","10:55,900","\"It's hard to because the camera wasn't there for some reason they decide not to make it split-screen\""]
["10:55,900","11:02,880","\"Yeah, I don't get that. I don't know why they didn't just do that because the thing is there's a Zelda one\""]
["11:02,880","11:07,400","\"That's four player and the way it works is when you connect online you only get to see yourself\""]
["11:07,400","11:10,880","\"So everyone's all the ones back there's a four player\""]
["11:10,880","11:16,600","\"Aquino time what and you get your own perspective. It's not set up like this\""]
["11:16,600","11:23,600","\"Because it's four player you can't do just two player what are you serious? Yeah, it's real and it works\""]
["11:23,600","11:26,160","\"It's much better than this. Why can't you do two player?\""]
["11:26,160","11:29,720","\"Because then there's two links who aren't doing anything\""]
["11:30,320","11:32,320","\"Why don't they just make a two-player version? Oh?\""]
["11:32,320","11:37,240","\"He's almost dead by the way good\""]
["11:37,240","11:44,440","\"There's one more I die in one hit, so we'll see what happens\""]
["11:44,440","11:47,960","\"Oh, no\""]
["11:47,960","11:56,320","\"This is scary don't don't let it don't let it don't let it\""]
["11:56,960","12:01,920","\"It's hard. I know those are just textures. I can't actually tell where they had\""]
["12:01,920","12:11,880","\"Moment of truth can I get it you can ask?\""]
["12:11,880","12:19,040","\"What happened I'm doing it to cheat\""]
["12:19,040","12:26,400","\"I'm too scared scared\""]
