["02:08,480","02:10,400","\"I didn't stop myself.\""]
["02:10,400","02:11,400","\"What do they want me to do?\""]
["02:11,400","02:12,400","\"Spider-Man 2.\""]
["02:12,400","02:15,000","\"You're stopping now you're thinking.\""]

["02:21,320","02:22,320","\"I don't like it.\""]
["02:22,320","02:23,320","\"Why not?\""]
["02:23,320","02:30,320","\"'Cause I get weirded out when people say that they didn't like the movie just because of the scene.\""]
["02:30,320","02:31,320","\"The montage.\""]
["02:31,320","02:32,320","\"No, I don't give a fuck about that.\""]
["02:32,320","02:34,320","\"It's stupid, but I don't care.\""]
["02:34,320","02:35,320","\"I just-\""]
["02:35,320","02:38,320","\"I don't think it's any more stupid than anything in any of the other previous.\""]
["02:38,320","02:40,320","\"Like, they were always really schlocky.\""]
["02:40,320","02:44,320","\"I just thought it was boring and I thought the characters were stupid and uninteresting.\""]
["02:44,320","02:46,320","\"I think it's the worst of the three.\""]
["02:46,320","02:49,320","\"He gets the pie and she says, \"\"How does the pie go so good?\"\"\""]
["02:49,320","02:51,320","\"Yeah, there's no good writing in it.\""]
["02:51,320","02:55,320","\"I think it's the worst of the three because they put too many shit.\""]
["02:55,320","02:57,320","\"I love that.\""]
["02:57,320","02:59,320","\"There's too many shit in this movie.\""]

["03:02,320","03:04,320","\"There's too much stuff to pay attention to.\""]
["03:04,320","03:10,320","\"I think it was unfocused because they thought the series would go on forever and they wanted to be able to have one.\""]
["03:10,320","03:15,320","\"If they had have done more scenes like the scene where the Sandman is like waking up for the first time, it would have been the best one.\""]
["03:15,320","03:19,320","\"There goes do do do do do.\""]
["03:19,320","03:21,320","\"It's a really good scene.\""]
