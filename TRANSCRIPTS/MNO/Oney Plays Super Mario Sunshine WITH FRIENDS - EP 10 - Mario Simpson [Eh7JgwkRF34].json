["03:42,320","03:47,780","\"Really? Yeah, the character from the show. Oh boy. That was their way of enticing people to spread it around\""]
["03:47,780","03:51,840","\"I remember I I was like this is what back when I was just responding to everything\""]
["03:51,840","03:56,280","\"I've responded to a brickelberry Facebook post I said your animation sucks\""]

["04:02,300","04:09,080","\"Very yeah, okay. I feel bad for animators in Canada\""]
["04:09,080","04:14,560","\"Why they're not allowed to work on anything good. Oh, it's true government pays for it\""]
["04:18,160","04:25,560","\"I always point out that if you look, go back to the old shit from the Canadian Film Board-funded cartoons.\""]
["04:25,560","04:27,060","\"They're so good. It's true.\""]
["04:27,060","04:28,360","\"And now they can't do anything.\""]
["04:28,360","04:29,560","\"No, Vanna way back.\""]
["04:29,560","04:32,060","\"No, Vanna was doing the merch. They were really good.\""]
["04:32,060","04:35,260","\"And then Rock 'n' Rule happened.\""]
["04:35,260","04:36,760","\"And they gave up, yeah.\""]
["04:36,760","04:39,760","\"I think it was right after that that they just started doing...\""]
["04:39,760","04:41,760","\"They started doing like, \"\"Care Bears\"\" stuff.\""]
["04:41,760","04:45,460","\"Are you saying the \"\"Care Bears\"\" movie wasn't good?\""]
["04:45,460","04:46,660","\"Yes.\""]
["04:47,060","04:48,260","\"But they resurrect the girl.\""]

["04:50,300","04:51,300","\"- They do. - They do.\""]
["04:51,300","04:53,220","\"- We should. You wanted to watch those.\""]
["04:53,220","04:54,620","\"- I mean, they probably should.\""]
["04:54,620","04:55,860","\"- It's essentially a ritual.\""]
["04:55,860","04:57,460","\"They circle around her and do it.\""]
["04:57,460","05:01,580","\"- I'm surprised that maybe anybody\""]
["05:01,580","05:04,780","\"that was old enough to have experienced the caribears mania.\""]
["05:04,780","05:07,060","\"Was there like a backlash to it\""]
["05:07,060","05:08,580","\"where people said it was satanic?\""]
["05:08,580","05:10,460","\"- Probably. They say everything.\""]
["05:10,460","05:11,900","\"Has this a Pokemon satanic?\""]
["05:11,900","05:13,100","\"- Exactly, yeah.\""]
["05:13,100","05:14,100","\"- Pokemon is satanic.\""]
["05:14,100","05:16,420","\"- We saw Pokemon live.\""]
["05:16,420","05:19,420","\"I'm fucking shit, talk about that.\""]
["05:19,420","05:24,820","\"Well, Julian, how should we approach it?\""]
["05:24,820","05:31,420","\"First of all, the person who played James\""]
["05:31,420","05:33,420","\"went on to do Book of Mormon.\""]
["05:33,420","05:35,420","\"Oh, that was pretty.\""]
["05:35,420","05:38,420","\"He escaped to the madness.\""]
["05:38,420","05:41,420","\"It's just all the songs from the Toobie and Master album\""]
["05:41,420","05:43,420","\"with like two originals.\""]
["05:43,420","05:45,420","\"Talk about your favorite.\""]
["05:45,420","05:47,620","\"Giovanni is Ash's dad.\""]
["05:47,620","05:50,660","\"Giovanni has a villain song and in the middle of it,\""]
["05:50,660","05:52,860","\"Jesse and James come out and James says,\""]
["05:52,860","05:55,940","\"well, what's his stance on social security and don't ask?\""]
["05:55,940","05:57,140","\"Don't tell.\""]
["05:57,140","05:58,820","\"And we were tuned out and it was just like,\""]
["05:58,820","06:00,160","\"wait, what the fuck?\""]
["06:00,160","06:02,900","\"- What does that mean?\""]
["06:02,900","06:05,820","\"- There's a whole thing about like, you know,\""]
["06:05,820","06:07,340","\"gays aren't allowed in the army.\""]
["06:07,340","06:08,460","\"Like it's a--\""]
["06:08,460","06:10,060","\"- Yeah, that's not, it's a political thing.\""]
["06:10,060","06:12,380","\"- Yeah, it's a thing anymore, but it was at the time.\""]
["06:12,380","06:16,320","\"And I think they're trying to make an implication\""]
["06:16,320","06:18,160","\"about James through that maybe.\""]
["06:18,160","06:21,320","\"When Team Rocket comes out, that's the best part\""]
["06:21,320","06:24,720","\"is that they say, well, they do the whole prepare for trouble\""]
["06:24,720","06:27,360","\"and they say, hello Milwaukee!\""]
["06:27,360","06:28,720","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:28,720","06:32,180","\"And because no one cheers, they make a whole bit out of it\""]
["06:32,180","06:35,200","\"for like two minutes to force the audience in interacting.\""]
["06:35,200","06:36,040","\"- No.\""]
["06:36,040","06:37,680","\"- And for the rest of the play, no one responds.\""]
["06:37,680","06:40,280","\"They do what kind of Pokemon are you?\""]
["06:40,280","06:42,040","\"The Pokedex is actually a black man\""]
["06:42,040","06:43,640","\"who comes out and raps about it.\""]
["06:43,640","06:44,480","\"- No.\""]
["06:44,480","06:48,780","\"- And when he says, \"\"Would I say poke you say ma'am, poke,\""]
["06:48,780","06:50,200","\"poke.\"\"\""]
["06:50,200","06:51,580","\"No one goes along with it.\""]
["06:51,580","06:53,320","\"So they get into the audience\""]
["06:53,320","06:55,220","\"and start interviewing kids saying,\""]
["06:55,220","06:58,080","\"\"\"Is your mom or dad a crabby?\"\"\""]
["06:58,080","06:59,880","\"- My mom.\""]

["07:01,240","07:05,240","\"Are your friends a muck or a, what was it?\""]
["07:05,240","07:06,080","\"- Slowpoke.\""]
["07:06,080","07:08,500","\"- A slow bro or a muck?\""]
["07:08,500","07:11,440","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:11,440","07:12,440","\"No.\""]
["07:12,440","07:18,040","\"But the end of the show, the final song, like they, it's a big thing everyone's out and\""]
["07:18,040","07:20,800","\"they all do final pose.\""]
["07:20,800","07:23,320","\"Dead silence for like 20 seconds.\""]
["07:23,320","07:26,320","\"The lights just go out and that's it.\""]
["07:26,320","07:28,520","\"It's really hard to watch.\""]

["07:33,520","07:35,520","\"♪ What will ♪\""]

["07:54,820","07:56,140","\"- They should have been there.\""]
["07:56,140","07:58,140","\"I just read the code of Shakespeare.\""]
["07:58,140","08:02,840","\"Stupid fucking...\""]
["08:02,840","08:04,840","\"I want to go home.\""]

["08:07,340","08:17,340","\"Please, I'm just a king, this guy.\""]
["08:17,340","08:21,340","\"He just picks one, make them stop.\""]
["08:21,340","08:23,340","\"Good, that's all I want.\""]
["08:23,340","08:25,340","\"He takes his mother away.\""]

["08:39,340","08:41,340","\"Oh! Oh!\""]
["08:41,340","08:43,340","\"Did they ever do that in Pokemon Gold and Silver?\""]
["08:43,340","08:45,340","\"Is there ever a female Mr. Mime?\""]
["08:45,340","08:46,340","\"I know.\""]
["08:46,340","08:47,340","\"J.K.\""]
["08:47,340","08:49,340","\"I think they're genderless or are they-\""]
["08:49,340","08:51,340","\"Because Mr. Mime can have a baby with you.\""]

["08:57,740","09:00,380","\"It's like a high percentage or something.\""]
["09:00,380","09:02,100","\"They don't-- because there's Mime Jr.\""]
["09:02,100","09:02,900","\"Yeah, but--\""]
["09:02,900","09:03,740","\"That's because--\""]
["09:03,740","09:04,580","\"Oh, yeah, that's true.\""]
["09:04,580","09:05,580","\"That's because they can have a baby, though.\""]

["09:18,860","09:19,980","\"A baby baby.\""]
["09:19,980","09:23,140","\"So what I'm asking, though, is in Pokemon Goldsilver,\""]

["09:25,340","09:26,340","\"I'm not sure.\""]
["09:26,340","09:28,540","\"I feel like they were genderless.\""]
["09:28,540","09:30,540","\"Because there are some genderless Pokemon.\""]
["09:30,540","09:34,540","\"There's like Voltorb and Magnemite.\""]
["09:34,540","09:35,540","\"I know a gender.\""]

["10:08,420","10:11,900","\"They should make a game called captain Toad\""]
["10:11,900","10:18,140","\"That's a really nice right idea Chris you should make it. What would it be about?\""]
["10:18,140","10:20,140","\"Mmm\""]
["10:20,140","10:22,540","\"Board captain code\""]
