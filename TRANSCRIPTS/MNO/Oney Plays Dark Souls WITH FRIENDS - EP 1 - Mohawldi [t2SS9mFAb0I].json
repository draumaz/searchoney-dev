["09:02,240","09:05,700","\"For you. Yeah, it was horrendous\""]
["09:05,700","09:14,860","\"Was it wasn't it like a really expensive limited edition thing - that's the thing about game limited editions is they always have those awful\""]
["09:14,860","09:17,300","\"Prizes yeah, and they're never fucking good\""]
["09:17,620","09:25,000","\"Why didn't they have a limited edition crash bandicoot that we could have got they did you get a fidget spinner with it?\""]
["09:25,000","09:28,200","\"Oh, that's right. Okay. It was a mine though. Wasn't it?\""]
["09:28,200","09:36,440","\"I think it was over here at least tubby fella. It's not I was saying to like if they seemed it\""]
["09:36,440","09:40,080","\"Like crash bandicoot it would make sense because crush bandicoot spins\""]
["09:40,080","09:44,780","\"But it's just camouflage pattern. It's just a random fidget spinner\""]
["09:45,400","09:51,520","\"They were probably trying to empty out stock or something. Yeah, it's just like blue. Yeah. Yeah, that's all it was\""]
["09:51,520","09:54,240","\"It's just blue camouflage. I'm pretty sure it was Ireland\""]

["10:21,000","10:25,000","\"They're making out of the environment. But over detailed you mean it looks kind of way too sharp\""]
["10:25,000","10:31,800","\"No, just like there's too many tiny little details. Oh, that's crowbird tension crowbird\""]
