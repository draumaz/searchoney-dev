["01:24,420","01:27,680","\"- I really, in the original marble thing.\""]
["01:27,680","01:28,520","\"- What?\""]
["01:28,520","01:29,780","\"- Marble madness.\""]
["01:29,780","01:31,180","\"- The Robbie Rotten compilation.\""]
["01:31,180","01:32,020","\"- Yes.\""]
["01:32,020","01:32,840","\"(laughing)\""]
["01:32,840","01:34,520","\"- I really, that was marble blast ultra.\""]
["01:34,520","01:37,880","\"- I really, I mean, it is, this is a follow-up to it.\""]
["01:37,880","01:39,800","\"- I really like jumping into the goal.\""]
["01:39,800","01:41,760","\"It feels really good when your ball gets sucked in.\""]
["01:41,760","01:42,880","\"- Yeah, it does.\""]
["01:42,880","01:44,240","\"- I'm glad this one does it too.\""]

["01:45,400","01:46,840","\"Look at that.\""]
["01:46,840","01:47,840","\"I got a gold medal.\""]
["01:47,840","01:48,640","\"Uh oh.\""]
["01:48,640","01:51,100","\"Now you got to collect the purple gel.\""]
["01:51,100","01:52,440","\"You got to get the Jim Rolds.\""]
["01:52,440","01:54,500","\"The Flem Rolds.\""]
["01:54,500","01:55,780","\"Don't call them that.\""]
["01:55,780","01:57,220","\"That's very disgusting.\""]
["01:57,220","01:59,620","\"Has anybody ever said that one bit?\""]
["01:59,620","02:02,220","\"What has anybody to make it sound more mystical?\""]
["02:02,220","02:03,700","\"Did they ever say ephemeral?\""]
["02:03,700","02:05,680","\"Ephemeral?\""]
["02:05,680","02:08,580","\"Like ephemeral to become fully trans.\""]
["02:08,580","02:10,500","\"You must collect eight of the Flem Rolds.\""]
["02:10,500","02:10,980","\"You could do it.\""]
["02:10,980","02:11,780","\"Listen, I would.\""]
["02:11,780","02:12,860","\"That would be fun.\""]
["02:12,860","02:13,420","\"It would be fun.\""]
["02:13,420","02:14,500","\"Then everyone would be trans.\""]
["02:15,660","02:16,940","\"But you have to collect the emeralds.\""]
["02:16,940","02:18,140","\"Everyone's trans and one will be...\""]
["02:18,140","02:19,900","\"Only one person would wield all the emeralds.\""]
["02:19,900","02:23,340","\"I want to collect all eight of the femuralds.\""]
["02:23,340","02:29,180","\"How many mystical emeralds do you think exist with different purposes like the femuralds?\""]
["02:29,180","02:32,140","\"Um... the... the... the... uh...\""]
["02:32,140","02:33,500","\"The flaminaralds?\""]
["02:33,500","02:34,380","\"Flaminaralds?\""]
["02:34,380","02:35,340","\"The flaminaralds?\""]
["02:35,340","02:37,900","\"The flaminar... I don't think flaminarald had emeralds.\""]
["02:37,900","02:41,340","\"I forgot about flaminarald.\""]
["02:41,340","02:42,940","\"I thought that's why you said it.\""]
["02:42,940","02:43,500","\"That's good.\""]
["02:44,300","02:46,300","\"I forgot about those two ugly fucking trees.\""]
["02:46,300","02:48,300","\"Yeah, you can summon them with the Flemming Earl rolls.\""]
["02:48,300","02:50,300","\"They're a support trophy.\""]
["02:50,300","02:52,300","\"I would have had a Flemming Earl.\""]
["02:52,300","02:56,300","\"I hated one of their dis- like not- not because it was bad just because he was disgusting to look at.\""]
["02:56,300","02:57,300","\"The one with the braces.\""]
["02:57,300","02:59,300","\"They're called Flemming Earl. They're supposed to be kind of disgusting.\""]
["02:59,300","03:01,300","\"I know, but I don't want to look at it.\""]
["03:01,300","03:02,300","\"Shit.\""]
["03:02,300","03:05,300","\"You jumped off this world to get away from them.\""]
["03:05,300","03:07,300","\"Oh wait, it gives you a power up.\""]
["03:07,300","03:08,300","\"Oops.\""]
["03:08,300","03:09,300","\"You're supposed to jump.\""]
["03:09,300","03:10,300","\"See it?\""]
["03:10,300","03:11,300","\"Okay.\""]
["03:11,300","03:12,300","\"That's the Supa jump.\""]
["03:12,300","03:13,300","\"Supa?\""]
["03:13,300","03:14,140","\"- I don't say it anymore.\""]
["03:14,140","03:16,060","\"- Yeah, that's too bad.\""]
["03:16,060","03:18,740","\"- The Switch controller, all of the buttons on it are on it.\""]
["03:18,740","03:20,720","\"- I have to get used to the layout\""]
["03:20,720","03:22,820","\"'cause Nintendo sometimes wants you to hit a button\""]
["03:22,820","03:24,460","\"I don't expect 'cause of the layout.\""]
["03:24,460","03:26,260","\"- We were talking on the car right over here\""]
["03:26,260","03:29,580","\"about how we all really like the GameCube controller.\""]
["03:29,580","03:32,260","\"I like how because the placement of the buttons\""]
["03:32,260","03:33,100","\"is really weird.\""]
["03:33,100","03:36,700","\"I think it helps you better remember\""]
["03:36,700","03:38,620","\"which buttons and where they are.\""]
["03:38,620","03:41,180","\"- I just as the way they're oriented.\""]
["03:41,180","03:46,400","\"There's this new design thing where all these companies are not color-coding things.\""]
["03:46,400","03:48,040","\"It's driving me fucking crazy.\""]
["03:48,040","03:49,960","\"Like, the Switch controller is all black.\""]
["03:49,960","03:54,740","\"I wouldn't care so much if it's like, \"\"Okay, the A button is where you would think it is,\"\"\""]
["03:54,740","03:56,600","\"compared to every other controller, but it isn't.\""]
["03:56,600","03:59,420","\"Some games mix it up on you and I get confused by the head.\""]
["03:59,420","04:00,760","\"Blender's doing that now too.\""]
["04:00,760","04:04,240","\"They made all of the UI black and gray, so nothing stands out.\""]
["04:04,240","04:05,420","\"It's hard to find anything.\""]
["04:05,420","04:06,720","\"Oh shit.\""]
["04:06,720","04:07,060","\"Big E.\""]
["04:07,060","04:07,920","\"Thank you, controller.\""]
["04:07,920","04:09,220","\"Chris, I used to slip-read.\""]
["04:09,220","04:11,220","\"*screams*\""]
["04:11,220","04:15,560","\"Why do you think they have all these road signs up here in float space? I don't know.\""]
["04:15,560","04:18,640","\"So marbles don't get lost. I freaking love physics!\""]
["04:18,640","04:19,720","\"*grunts*\""]
["04:19,720","04:21,960","\"You need some speed to make it up the slope!\""]
["04:21,960","04:22,960","\"I don't need speed!\""]
["04:22,960","04:23,960","\"*screams*\""]
["04:23,960","04:25,120","\"Shit!\""]
["04:25,120","04:27,040","\"What's your favorite physics game?\""]
["04:27,040","04:29,440","\"Um, as a super physics brother.\""]
["04:29,440","04:31,680","\"As of lately that overgrowth game with the rabbits.\""]
["04:31,680","04:34,440","\"Does... oh yeah, you were talking about that, right?\""]
["04:34,440","04:35,440","\"It's fucking great, yeah.\""]
["04:35,440","04:36,440","\"Oh, y'all!\""]
["04:36,440","04:37,440","\"Okay, sorry.\""]
["04:37,440","04:39,440","\"Super bumper brothers\""]
["04:39,440","04:46,080","\"Play that does world of goo count. Yeah accounts. I really like more of a puzzle game than a physics sandbox though\""]
["04:46,080","04:48,340","\"Yeah\""]
["04:48,340","04:51,640","\"There's not much you can do to really play with it like once you know\""]
["04:51,640","04:55,700","\"You son of a son of a snake good structural stuff. It's like okay\""]
["04:55,700","04:59,840","\"I know how to do this now. I like games like when GTA 4 came out\""]
["04:59,840","05:02,100","\"That's what I was about to say I had the physics like\""]
["05:03,100","05:09,100","\"Yeah, it's so fun. You could just fuck with things and GTA 5 has it too, but it seems like they dumped it down a little bit\""]
["05:09,100","05:12,340","\"But I just I like physics and everything\""]
["05:12,340","05:17,820","\"What about in real life? It's very fun. That's why I mastered physics and college\""]
["05:17,820","05:23,440","\"That's why I ragdolled into class every day like a marble. Wow look at this one. I\""]
["05:23,440","05:29,500","\"Don't like I don't like my marble look doesn't look like a marble you can't you can pick out a new one\""]
["05:29,500","05:31,500","\"I don't want I\""]
["05:31,900","05:38,760","\"Don't like this marble, but I'll use it there's gotta be like an eyeball marble. There is an eyeball marble good. There's a pumpkin marble\""]
["05:38,760","05:41,780","\"Does it have like a single eye?\""]
["05:41,780","05:47,740","\"Yes, if I was gonna design a pumpkin marble, I would make it have a say it's a big eyeball. I think\""]
["05:47,740","05:54,960","\"There are a lot of fun marbles in this game. Yeah, well explain to me every less one of okay, uh\""]
["05:54,960","05:57,780","\"there there's\""]
["05:57,780","06:04,180","\"Dipsy the marble and he's having a crisis his best friend Tammy won't go out with there's the grand marble\""]

["06:09,920","06:16,840","\"You're not taking this question series. There's marble - it has twice the density of a regular marble\""]
["06:16,840","06:20,220","\"The stage is named after the dual Aldi of marble kind. Oh\""]
["06:20,220","06:22,940","\"No Chris no\""]
["06:22,940","06:27,020","\"What would you do if in back to the future when he walked up to Lorraine and he said turned into a marble\""]
["06:27,020","06:33,300","\"My dent dent shitty and she said I am your flimsy and she's just got sick all over him\""]
["06:33,300","06:39,020","\"Like she starts spitting up flam would that ruin the movie for you? No, well, they said you're my density\""]
["06:39,020","06:41,020","\"And then he started gaining weight\""]
["06:41,020","06:47,860","\"Your mind really you really are my dent shitty look at that\""]
["06:47,860","06:50,580","\"Did you make it?\""]
["06:50,580","06:52,980","\"This is easy watch\""]
["06:52,980","06:54,980","\"Oh\""]
["06:54,980","07:01,700","\"Pick the same life oops you've got a silver let's do it again and waste everyone's day\""]
["07:01,700","07:06,900","\"Hey everybody. This is one less minute. You have left in your life. Look. I'm gonna get a\""]

["07:22,180","07:25,940","\"Surgeons play this game you know no they don't\""]
["07:25,940","07:30,760","\"Play Final Fantasy 8 they do because they're really invested in the plot line\""]
["07:30,760","07:38,820","\"With being a doctor patients if the sit through it. Oh my god\""]
["07:38,820","07:41,960","\"I'm proud of you\""]

["08:20,220","08:22,580","\"I think I'll be floating platforms in the sky.\""]
["08:22,580","08:23,940","\"Didn't you ever play Coola World?\""]
["08:23,940","08:25,940","\"I felt like a ball in that game when I felt great.\""]
["08:25,940","08:26,940","\"Coola World looks fun.\""]
["08:26,940","08:28,420","\"I would like to try it.\""]
["08:28,420","08:29,420","\"It's not.\""]
["08:29,420","08:31,340","\"It's really just a puzzle game though.\""]

["08:32,340","08:33,340","\"That's fine by me.\""]
["08:33,340","08:34,340","\"There's no physics.\""]
["08:34,340","08:35,340","\"It's still fun.\""]
["08:35,340","08:36,340","\"Yeah, but you better.\""]
["08:36,340","08:39,180","\"You gotta know how many steps to take.\""]
["08:39,180","08:41,580","\"So write a game short code to make everything fall down.\""]
["08:41,580","08:43,500","\"Okay, there's physics now.\""]
["08:43,500","08:44,940","\"People are gonna take this too seriously.\""]
["08:44,940","08:46,500","\"Listen, I don't want physics in every game.\""]
["08:46,500","08:47,500","\"It's a joke.\""]

["08:48,500","08:53,620","\"I know but other people like a code for what idiot he really wants physics and cooler world. Oh\""]
["08:53,620","08:58,000","\"Actually, I kind of do to see what a look\""]
["08:58,000","09:05,060","\"Listen I understand that I understand that feeling really I really want to try someday to\""]
["09:05,060","09:13,020","\"I'm hoping ding dong will help me because he's he's the numbers man. He knows smart things. I want to do I want to put\""]
