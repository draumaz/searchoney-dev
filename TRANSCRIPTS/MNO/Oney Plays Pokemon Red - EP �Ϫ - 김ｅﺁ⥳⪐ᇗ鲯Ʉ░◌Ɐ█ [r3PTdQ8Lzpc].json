["00:29,960","00:32,680","\"Now that we've deleted and defeated everything.\""]
["00:32,680","00:34,160","\"- I like the way you pause the perspective.\""]
["00:34,160","00:36,200","\"- Yeah, I had to think about it.\""]
["00:36,200","00:39,400","\"We got our coffee now and we feel great.\""]

["00:46,880","00:47,880","\"- Don't you know how to catch a cold?\""]
["00:47,880","00:48,720","\"- I'm sure not to go through me.\""]
["00:48,720","00:49,800","\"- I'll show you how.\""]
["00:49,800","00:51,240","\"I'm pretty good at it.\""]
["00:51,240","00:52,440","\"- Ooh, I remember this man.\""]
["00:52,440","00:54,640","\"- Are you allowed to do this as many times as you want?\""]
["00:54,640","00:56,520","\"Like, just talk to him or did you just never do it?\""]
["00:56,520","00:57,800","\"- No, I never did it.\""]
["00:58,700","01:02,740","\"Okay, you never did this? No. You fucking piece of shit.\""]
["01:02,740","01:05,640","\"Didn't you want to watch the old man throw a ball at a bug?\""]
["01:05,640","01:08,300","\"Yeah\""]
["01:08,300","01:10,940","\"Is as other hand or is his nose just really long?\""]
["01:10,940","01:15,200","\"Uh, I took it to V along those, but I guess it could be.\""]
["01:15,200","01:22,120","\"Okay, well, there you go. That was good advice. Let's go weaken us a Pokemon. Okay, baby. Uh, sorry. He's got it.\""]
["01:22,120","01:25,860","\"Wow, he's got cut and fly. He's pretty powerful.\""]
["01:27,280","01:31,160","\"I love Cinebar. I just love that they go to the bar.\""]
["01:31,160","01:34,760","\"What if they only sold Cinebans on Cinebar?\""]
["01:34,760","01:36,400","\"I go to Cinebans Island.\""]
["01:36,400","01:37,520","\"That'd be okay.\""]
["01:37,520","01:39,560","\"I mean Cinebar Island got destroyed, didn't it?\""]
["01:39,560","01:40,840","\"They can make a Cineban Island.\""]
["01:40,840","01:44,880","\"Is it like shaped like a Cineban?\""]
["01:44,880","01:46,880","\"Like there's a big swirl.\""]
["01:46,880","01:49,160","\"That's why Mewtwo blew it up. You want it Cineban Island.\""]
["01:49,160","01:50,840","\"That was the plot of the movie. I remember.\""]
["01:50,840","01:56,040","\"And here we will build the biggest Cineban store in all of the question.\""]
["01:56,040","01:59,240","\"Instead of giving you trading cards when you want to see the movie that gave you cinnamon\""]
["01:59,240","02:07,120","\"I would wait prefer that. Yeah, but probably well no because now I do regret that I never got one of those music cards\""]
["02:07,120","02:09,120","\"Oh\""]
["02:09,120","02:14,400","\"I had that too. Yeah, I like that I got that from my VHS. Oh, you got it from your VHS\""]
["02:14,400","02:20,360","\"Yeah, I remember the VHS for Pokemon the first movie because professor Oak gets pantsed at the beginning\""]
["02:20,360","02:23,080","\"And that's really embarrassing really isn't that right?\""]
["02:23,080","02:24,080","\"Alright, Alec is em.\""]

["02:44,840","02:48,320","\"I think it's a rare prehistoric Pokemon, good for you.\""]
["02:48,320","02:52,320","\"It's made out of the eighth guide of my theory, you know?\""]
["02:52,320","02:54,320","\"It's just a bunch of box tops.\""]
["02:54,320","02:56,320","\"Okay, where are you?\""]

["06:49,480","06:51,520","\"I don't know why they did it while we were on vacation.\""]
["06:51,520","06:53,120","\"Maybe it was cheaper out there or something.\""]
["06:53,120","06:56,280","\"- I remember I had the strategy guide for Pokemon Stadium\""]
["06:56,280","06:58,080","\"but I didn't actually own it.\""]
["06:58,080","07:05,080","\"I always would look at it and I'd pretend that I owned it, but I would just rent it from Blockbuster because we couldn't really buy games. We'd just rent them all the time.\""]
["07:05,080","07:09,080","\"Here's a question. You know the jumbled sprites on Missing Gino?\""]

["07:16,080","07:17,080","\"That's a good question, I have no idea.\""]
["07:17,080","07:21,080","\"It's probably because it's just how it's calling it. It's a fixed thing every time.\""]
["07:21,080","07:23,080","\"It can appear in different things though.\""]
["07:23,080","07:24,080","\"Yay!\""]
