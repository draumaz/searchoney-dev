["00:05,600","00:09,000","\"Look, there are certain things about games I don't like,\""]
["00:09,000","00:11,400","\"but that does not mean they're bad. I just don't like them.\""]
["00:11,400","00:15,800","\"No, I agree. I think it's a stupid fucking thing that makes you do that, but I guess I can understand why.\""]
["00:15,800","00:17,800","\"Like, uh...\""]
["00:17,800","00:19,400","\"Look, I don't like\""]
["00:19,400","00:21,200","\"a fetch quest where it's literally\""]

["00:31,800","00:34,200","\"I guess it's like you have to think of the kind of game.\""]
["00:34,200","00:38,600","\"I mean, these are in the game, but they'll just reward you if you end up killing them.\""]
["00:38,600","00:39,600","\"Those kinds of quests.\""]
["00:39,600","00:40,600","\"No, that's fine.\""]

["00:45,000","00:46,000","\"Those are just batting.\""]
["00:46,000","00:47,000","\"Yeah, it's padding.\""]
["00:47,000","00:48,000","\"That's nothing.\""]
["00:48,000","00:53,000","\"But you can make a fetch quest fun if you add surprises in it.\""]
["00:53,000","00:56,400","\"It's like, hmm, go deliver this letter to my wife, right?\""]

["01:11,880","01:16,580","\"The theme like questline is always good. I enjoyed that in oblivion actually. Yeah, I hated everything else\""]
["01:16,580","01:21,520","\"The thief guild is cool because like it starts out. It's like oh, you're a thief who's stealing stuff\""]
["01:21,520","01:26,800","\"But what you're really doing is you're stealing from the wrong people and then when you find that out\""]
["01:27,320","01:33,880","\"You get a trade and then you go to like this like mystical holy world and get this like fucking like I hate saying the word\""]
["01:33,880","01:37,720","\"But you get this like actually like epic armor and you battle like a fucking deity. Yeah\""]

["02:03,120","02:05,120","\"I think the Skyrim's DLC is actually pretty good\""]
["02:05,120","02:11,580","\"But Skyrim's base game fucking blows. It's like every single room. You just walk into a room\""]
["02:11,580","02:18,140","\"There's 90 caves and castles that all of the exact same you have the same puzzle where you have to line up a fucking\""]
