["00:05,400","00:08,400","\"I love this fucking universe.\""]
["00:08,400","00:10,400","\"I wish I could live here.\""]
["00:10,400","00:14,500","\"Honestly, it's like those people that play av-\""]
["00:14,500","00:15,800","\"or fucking watch avatars.\""]
["00:15,800","00:17,300","\"Yeah, the avatar thing.\""]
["00:17,300","00:20,900","\"I feel like we talked about that a little bit ago about-\""]
["00:20,900","00:21,600","\"Didn't we?\""]
["00:21,600","00:24,600","\"The avatar like- like- like Envy syndrome.\""]
["00:24,600","00:26,200","\"This is the exact opposite.\""]
["00:26,200","00:28,200","\"I would fucking hate this universe.\""]
["00:29,400","00:30,240","\"Are you kidding?\""]
["00:30,240","00:32,520","\"This is what I want to do every day.\""]
["00:32,520","00:36,600","\"You're walking down the street and all the buildings start breaking and crumbling and you're like,\""]
["00:36,600","00:37,960","\"\"\"Here we fucking go again.\"\"\""]
["00:37,960","00:39,960","\"And everybody would think I was so cool.\""]
["00:39,960","00:42,800","\"No one can even see you doing this cool shit.\""]
["00:42,800","00:45,680","\"Yeah, well that's what they don't understand, right?\""]
["00:45,680","00:49,560","\"Yeah, so I'd be misunderstood, which makes you even rather tragic.\""]
["00:49,560","00:50,960","\"Girl, understand.\""]
["00:50,960","00:51,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:51,960","00:52,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:52,960","00:56,560","\"Dude, look at all that rack equipment, Tomar.\""]
["00:56,560","00:58,280","\"Don't you want to just steal all of it?\""]
["00:58,880","00:59,380","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["00:59,380","01:03,440","\"I wonder is there a compressor in there for a limiter perhaps?\""]
["01:03,440","01:04,500","\"Hmm.\""]
["01:04,500","01:09,500","\"I was gonna say is this still supposed to be escaping the broadcast studio still or?\""]
["01:09,500","01:10,920","\"Uh yeah, I think so.\""]
["01:10,920","01:13,480","\"So maybe that is more like sound gear because.\""]
["01:13,480","01:16,640","\"Are you here or like servers or something?\""]
["01:16,640","01:18,740","\"Tell them where you're a smart guy.\""]
["01:18,740","01:20,480","\"What are they really?\""]
["01:20,480","01:22,080","\"I still don't know what a limiter is.\""]
["01:22,080","01:26,080","\"A limiter is actually technically still a type of compressor just with.\""]
["01:26,080","01:27,200","\"Uh.\""]
["01:28,160","01:33,440","\"Fuck I literally looked this up the other day, but I'm not gonna try to explain it because I can't remember it\""]
["01:33,440","01:35,640","\"Well, I know sound from peeking is that all it is?\""]
["01:35,640","01:42,320","\"That is the point. Yeah, yeah at a certain cutoff it just sort of compresses down to like negative infinity\""]
["01:42,320","01:43,680","\"Gotcha\""]
["01:43,680","01:49,680","\"Gotcha, I got the stupid key that I'm not gonna use even if I see the door negative infinity\""]
["01:49,680","01:53,280","\"That is such a silly thing. You just said you don't know what the fuck you're talking about Tomar\""]
["01:53,280","01:57,920","\"You're such a liar negative and for no negative infinity is a legitimate\""]
["01:57,920","02:02,720","\"term when you're talking about like like always going I don't know\""]
["02:02,720","02:08,200","\"Your Tomar I'm gonna read out something you said I guess it goes towards zero no cuz you're DB\""]
["02:08,200","02:14,040","\"You're gonna read out something he said Tomar says some fucking outlandish li-ish thing sometimes\""]
["02:14,040","02:16,360","\"Okay, read him back since you can't see\""]
["02:16,360","02:23,920","\"Chris just pulled out his phone to like cite Tomar directly. All right. Let's do this. Let's have a little showdown\""]
["02:24,800","02:30,960","\"Okay, you're part of the the Bulbo process you're doing DevOps right look he says\""]
["02:30,960","02:36,280","\"All right, that got everything unstuck I changed my dellimeter from equals to the\""]
["02:36,280","02:39,640","\"equals equals was stupid of me to use equal\""]
["02:39,640","02:44,280","\"It was stupid\""]
["02:44,280","02:52,640","\"The first time and you put in a comment with an equal sign it broke my it broke my program\""]
["02:53,600","02:56,680","\"I shouldn't have used equals I used equals equals equals equals\""]
["02:56,680","03:03,600","\"Such a fucking weird thing for an outsider to see I mean yeah without any context is weird\""]
["03:03,600","03:06,320","\"I'm only kidding, but it is funny\""]
["03:06,320","03:11,560","\"Sorry sometimes I just write that stuff out so that I have a record of what I did\""]
["03:11,560","03:15,600","\"Every time you write actually that I want to respond and be like that was really stupid of you\""]
["03:15,600","03:18,120","\"But that joke gets kind of old\""]
["03:18,120","03:22,000","\"No, not you\""]
["03:22,000","03:32,360","\"Oh cool he's cool. Oh man if that ran at me I would fucking screech. Would you like actually\""]
["03:32,360","03:41,940","\"piss yourself? I think so yeah. Be scary honestly. Yeah Tom right here's another one. Should\""]
["03:41,940","03:46,440","\"just be minor reganx logic changes I'll try to get it tomorrow and then he posts all\""]
["03:46,440","03:50,120","\"the scary code and he goes this should do the trick, go to run another build to make\""]
["03:50,120","03:51,820","\"Make sure this doesn't break anything.\""]
["03:51,820","03:54,860","\"And I said, yep, I can confirm this one is the one.\""]
["03:54,860","03:57,020","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:57,020","04:01,500","\"- You're just, look, that's not for Chris.\""]
["04:01,500","04:03,540","\"It's mostly just me talking to Andrew,\""]
["04:03,540","04:04,740","\"who's the lead developer.\""]
["04:04,740","04:05,580","\"- This is funny.\""]
["04:05,580","04:07,380","\"- 'Kay, Tom are just curious,\""]
["04:07,380","04:11,180","\"what does an equals do in comparison to an equals equals?\""]
["04:11,180","04:13,540","\"- So I have to give a lot of context\""]
["04:13,540","04:14,980","\"because it's not a code thing.\""]
["04:14,980","04:16,460","\"It's like, hold on, I'm gonna stop.\""]
["04:16,460","04:18,980","\"Is this interesting enough to fucking like it?\""]
["04:18,980","04:25,360","\"You know what, you said some pretty uninteresting shit on here buddy. That's fair. But you know you're right\""]
["04:25,360","04:27,700","\"We shouldn't talk about fucking dork shit\""]
["04:27,700","04:31,200","\"I was gonna say it's fine with Chris just making fun of\""]
["04:31,200","04:34,840","\"Me trying to be helpful for his game projects\""]
["04:34,840","04:39,940","\"You be able to break it down for me in like literally 10 seconds, but if it's gonna take 40 hours look\""]
["04:39,940","04:44,180","\"It's her this is you guys trying to talk about this in the heat of the moment and\""]
["04:44,820","04:47,820","\"I'm just an ethereal ghost to you.\""]
["04:47,820","04:58,820","\"I'm basically just feeding away because I used an equals instead of an equals equals equals equals equals equals\""]
["04:58,820","05:01,820","\"And then they leave because they hate each other now.\""]
["05:01,820","05:02,820","\"Fuck you, Jack.\""]
["05:02,820","05:04,820","\"You didn't make me apple pie.\""]
["05:04,820","05:06,820","\"Fuck you.\""]
["05:06,820","05:10,820","\"That's a Lyle and Kyle.\""]
["05:10,820","05:40,800","\"running a video for only plays. She should have just used her pussy. Well, great aim there. She should have just why the spray was. She heard why her white said fajigini. If I swear to God, if I see a sloppy vaguette ball, I will scream. Do you like Mean Girls lile? Like the movie or the actual thing? The movie. It's fine. I think it's a good movie. It's a good remake of Heather's.\""]
["05:40,800","05:45,720","\"Is it really yeah, no, I do like mean girls though. I think me girls is a great film\""]
["05:45,720","05:51,000","\"It's honestly easier to watch than Heather's just cuz Heather's is so dated. I've never seen Heather's\""]
["05:51,000","05:55,680","\"It's really weird how that movie just managed to kind of I don't know\""]
["05:55,680","05:58,840","\"It seems like a movie that even if people liked it they wouldn't admit to liking it\""]
["05:58,840","06:03,800","\"But for some reason that one sort of gets a pass. Yeah, everybody who likes it admits to it\""]
["06:03,800","06:09,680","\"It seems like it should be just a movie for teenage girls, but it's really well done. Yeah\""]
["06:09,680","06:13,600","\"Oh, I'm the ghost now. I'm Ted ghost\""]
["06:13,600","06:24,680","\"Bitch now watches you get stuff. I'm gonna say how many people can really claim to know the back of their hand that well\""]
["06:24,680","06:29,200","\"I'll go introduce you to the back of my hand. You don't stop running your fucking hole\""]
["06:29,200","06:35,080","\"I can keep finding game tell I never noticed I had before in the bag of your head. Yeah\""]
["06:35,920","06:39,660","\"Like pop up you would think I would have noticed before keep popping your tomb\""]
["06:39,660","06:45,200","\"I keep growing more I keep pouring this like weird substance\""]
["06:45,200","06:50,040","\"I found on tumors to remove it, but then more grow in place if you started growing tumors on your hand\""]
["06:50,040","06:54,840","\"And then you like popped them and there were like little teeth inside would you use them like chew gum and stuff?\""]
["06:54,840","07:01,680","\"I could try it like you could control. Yeah, I mean you could just you know flap your hand open and shut like you're doing\""]
["07:01,680","07:03,680","\"I see you know what I mean\""]
["07:05,080","07:09,520","\"Maybe start like a little comedy routine based entirely around your hand teeth\""]
["07:09,520","07:16,720","\"This is fucking scary. Do you like a carrot top prop comedy thing? Yeah, exactly you do it\""]
["07:16,720","07:24,560","\"Your dad's a\""]
["07:24,560","07:28,280","\"Psychopath dentist dentist that was the word I was with that's a dentist yeah\""]
["07:28,280","07:32,020","\"Technically if you came to him with hand teeth\""]
["07:32,020","07:34,720","\"Do you think you'd show you how to like brush him and care for him and sure?\""]
["07:34,720","07:39,720","\"Do you think he'd be excited? He'd be like, \"\"Oh, as a research dentist, this is a great breakthrough.\"\"\""]
["07:39,720","07:40,720","\"That's happened before, right?\""]
["07:40,720","07:47,720","\"I could maybe, maybe it would. Maybe my dad would, like, lock me in a lab and it'd be like, like, uh...\""]
["07:47,720","07:54,720","\"like, some traumatic movie shit where, like, I'm in prison for the rest of my life so they can study my hand teeth.\""]
["07:54,720","08:02,720","\"Do you think, um, anyone would believe that it was just so happened that a combat dentist or whatever had a son with teeth hands?\""]
["08:02,720","08:05,400","\"- Combat dentist. - Yeah.\""]
["08:05,400","08:07,800","\"- My dad is not a combat dentist.\""]
["08:07,800","08:09,000","\"- He's getting caught.\""]
["08:09,000","08:11,640","\"- If we're speaking hypothetically, I guess.\""]
["08:11,640","08:17,560","\"- Do you think if I grew teeth on my hands, right?\""]
["08:17,560","08:19,120","\"But then I extracted the teeth,\""]
["08:19,120","08:20,440","\"but they just kept growing back.\""]
["08:20,440","08:21,920","\"Would I be able to make a good salary\""]
["08:21,920","08:23,280","\"just selling teeth to people?\""]
["08:23,280","08:24,320","\"- I think so.\""]
["08:24,320","08:27,160","\"If you could just keep extracting the teeth\""]
["08:27,160","08:29,040","\"from your hand and they didn't have nerve endings,\""]
["08:29,040","08:31,800","\"or maybe they do, maybe it's horribly painful for you.\""]
["08:31,800","08:32,800","\"Oh god, he caught her.\""]
["08:32,800","08:34,800","\"I've got you, motherfucker.\""]
["08:34,800","08:35,800","\"Whoa!\""]
["08:35,800","08:38,280","\"Wait, why can you pull down that thing?\""]
["08:38,280","08:39,280","\"That's how you're gonna die, Tomar.\""]
["08:39,280","08:40,880","\"That is the exact way.\""]
["08:40,880","08:43,120","\"A server falling on me, you know?\""]
["08:43,120","08:47,480","\"I count among the people where the odds for that exist.\""]
["08:47,480","08:49,280","\"That's gonna be like your Walter White ending.\""]
["08:49,280","08:50,680","\"It's gonna be like poetic.\""]
["08:50,680","08:51,680","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:51,680","08:54,160","\"We're just a rack of really expensive servers.\""]

["08:56,160","09:01,720","\"Your $1,000,000 servers full of JPEGs of hamsters will fall on you.\""]
["09:01,720","09:04,300","\"How did you know about that hamster server?\""]
["09:04,300","09:06,540","\"Because you accidentally gave it to me.\""]
["09:06,540","09:09,420","\"You sent me one hamster, JPEG,\""]
["09:09,420","09:10,740","\"and I went right clicked on the hamster\""]

["09:15,260","09:17,500","\"And then led you straight to the rest.\""]
["09:17,500","09:18,500","\"When I saw all those servers,\""]
["09:18,500","09:19,740","\"I just put one and one together.\""]

["12:21,640","12:24,940","\"Okay, ah fuck damn law\""]
["12:24,940","12:29,320","\"Wow\""]
["12:29,320","12:31,420","\"Great Wow. Yeah, actually Wow\""]
["12:31,420","12:38,280","\"Revenant like the movie. Yeah, it was the bear and the movie the revenue the other way the bear eats the guy\""]
["12:38,280","12:39,280","\"Yeah\""]
["12:39,280","12:43,560","\"It looks a little too real don't you think are you implying that it's a real bear?\""]
["12:43,560","12:46,800","\"Well, I think they might have gotten a real bear to kill a real dude\""]
["12:46,800","12:51,160","\"And then they used it as reference for a fake bear. That would be kind of zany. I\""]
["12:51,160","12:59,040","\"I can't really use any other word to describe it. Oh man. Did you see that Russian dude who got found in a bear cave?\""]
["12:59,040","13:05,720","\"Was he alive? Yeah, was he hanging with the bears? No, what happened was a bear\""]
["13:06,160","13:11,080","\"broke his back and dragged him into his cave so he was he's paralyzed from the neck down and\""]
["13:11,080","13:17,340","\"He survived on his own piss for like a month and but unlike that they found him alive\""]
["13:17,340","13:24,760","\"But there's a video of him just like alive in a hospital bed and he looks literally like a rotting corpse\""]
["13:24,760","13:27,640","\"It's like the scary shit ever. Oh cool\""]
["13:27,640","13:35,960","\"Not cool. Oh, but it is very scary. Yeah bears are fucked. Yeah, I don't\""]
["13:35,960","13:37,960","\"like bears you know what is a town in a\""]
["13:37,960","13:39,840","\"Canada somewhere\""]
["13:39,840","13:44,600","\"Where people leave their homes and cars unlocked in case a bear runs up to you?\""]
["13:44,600","13:47,600","\"You can just go into someone's car or home really yeah\""]
["13:47,600","13:50,680","\"Don't bears like dig into those two\""]
["13:50,680","13:54,360","\"I don't think they open cars and shit well\""]
["13:54,360","14:00,760","\"I remember when I went fucking camping like you had to put all your shit in like a steel box because bears would break into your car to get it\""]
["14:00,760","14:04,600","\"If they smell food in a car than maybe well if they're trying to eat you your food\""]
["14:04,600","14:08,500","\"They smell you in the car. They'll fucking like throw the car or whatever a bear can do. That's true\""]

["14:11,800","14:15,840","\"Yeah, I don't get why we we don't go to war with those\""]
["14:15,840","14:21,000","\"Honestly, I heard about these camps in the 40s\""]
["14:21,000","14:27,480","\"Bears yeah, yeah exactly those are the summer camps. We know I'm loved today\""]
["14:28,720","14:35,620","\"They were revolutionized in the 40s. That's all we're talking about. Is it like is it regular a regular thing?\""]
["14:35,620","14:39,640","\"You know the summer camps for kids in the US. Yeah, who bears like attack kids a lot?\""]
["14:39,640","14:41,960","\"You know\""]
["14:41,960","14:44,920","\"It's weird you think you'd think you'd hear about it more right?\""]
["14:44,920","14:50,560","\"I don't know if you'd hear about it more or less if that happened right because nobody wants to hear a story about a kid getting eaten\""]
["14:50,560","14:54,120","\"By a bear but at the same time it's more of a tragedy if the kid gets eaten by a bear\""]
["14:54,120","14:56,720","\"Yeah, and a bear is not gonna distinguish like oh dude\""]
["14:56,720","14:58,800","\"It would be really fucked up if I like ate this kid.\""]
["14:58,800","14:59,800","\"So yeah.\""]
["14:59,800","15:01,320","\"It's not like the movies, right?\""]
["15:01,320","15:04,800","\"Like, like, since like America's so open,\""]
["15:04,800","15:07,800","\"you can't really stop bears from walking around.\""]
["15:07,800","15:08,800","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:08,800","15:12,400","\"I sure hope bears stop eating my kids.\""]
["15:12,400","15:14,960","\"This is the third one.\""]
["15:14,960","15:16,960","\"It takes so much time to make another.\""]
["15:16,960","15:19,520","\"We should teach our kids to eat bear cubs if anything.\""]
["15:19,520","15:22,400","\"Yeah, that's true.\""]
["15:22,400","15:25,960","\"You know they're like trying to get people to start eating kangaroos and shit.\""]
["15:25,960","15:26,960","\"I heard about that.\""]
["15:26,960","15:30,440","\"Yeah, I would feel bad that they look too human to me.\""]
["15:30,440","15:31,200","\"Kangaroos?\""]
["15:31,200","15:32,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:32,840","15:35,320","\"I don't know if I agree with that.\""]
["15:35,320","15:36,880","\"They've got like human Torsos.\""]
["15:36,880","15:37,720","\"It's weird.\""]
["15:37,720","15:40,960","\"Kind of, but is the Torso what makes a man to you, Chris?\""]
["15:40,960","15:42,160","\"Absolutely.\""]
["15:42,160","15:42,880","\"Oh, OK.\""]
["15:42,880","15:44,760","\"It's the manliest part of a man.\""]
["15:44,760","15:46,880","\"I guess that's fair to a certain extent.\""]
["15:46,880","15:50,800","\"I can see where you're coming from.\""]
["15:50,800","15:51,600","\"It makes sense.\""]
["15:51,600","15:54,960","\"Maybe if we give Kangaroos cosmetic surgery,\""]
["15:54,960","15:56,960","\"People will want to kill them and eat them so much.\""]
["15:56,960","15:57,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:57,960","16:00,960","\"Well no, they want to kill them and eat them because they're overpopulating.\""]
["16:00,960","16:01,960","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["16:01,960","16:06,460","\"So we should want to give them cosmetic surgery to maybe make the torso more animalistic\""]
["16:06,460","16:11,320","\"so that people like you can get off their high horse and start eating them for the good\""]
["16:11,320","16:12,320","\"of mankind.\""]
["16:12,320","16:15,960","\"Maybe if they fucking assimilated to our culture we wouldn't have so many problems with them,\""]
["16:15,960","16:16,960","\"you know?\""]
["16:16,960","16:17,960","\"Kangarooin.\""]
["16:17,960","16:18,960","\"Kangarooin.\""]
["16:18,960","16:21,560","\"What the hell is Kangarooin?\""]
["16:21,560","16:23,560","\"The plural of kangaroosin.\""]
["16:23,560","16:27,560","\"Oh, okay. So, Mar, he's making up words.\""]
["16:27,560","16:29,560","\"Make him stop.\""]

["19:04,980","19:10,120","\"I never really picked up what the Ghost Guy's name was, but he screams at him\""]
