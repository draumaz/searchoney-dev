["00:41,000","00:42,000","\"Um, no.\""]
["00:42,000","00:43,000","\"It's funny.\""]
["00:43,000","00:44,000","\"Why do you think other people do?\""]
["00:44,000","00:50,000","\"Because they know that it was scary and they think they should be scared.\""]
["00:50,000","00:53,000","\"I never thought I was particularly scared.\""]

["01:03,040","01:08,240","\"The nice said them might remember they I remember like\""]
["01:08,240","01:12,900","\"Hearing about Lego they did the weird funny voice because they wanted it to sound\""]
["01:12,900","01:16,560","\"I thought it would sound creepy if the voice was gender ambiguous\""]
["01:16,560","01:19,960","\"And to me it just sounds like a cartoon joke. You mean that yeah\""]
["01:19,960","01:22,960","\"Yeah, it sounds like we're fucking\""]
["01:24,320","01:28,880","\"Like the bad guy from Sonic the robot next helper\""]
["01:28,880","01:33,080","\"It's a little me\""]
["01:33,080","01:37,900","\"Robotni helper. Yeah, like the guy with the long nose. I don't know what his name. Oh that little guy\""]
["01:37,900","01:41,640","\"Well, it's Sonic sad. I am nightly was that it?\""]
["01:41,640","01:47,800","\"Why do I remember that I barely watched this show. I know nothing about it. We watched Sonic Underground. I\""]
["01:47,800","01:50,600","\"remember more about that\""]
["01:50,600","01:54,800","\"You remember the one the all you remember is the one with the baby\""]
["01:54,800","02:01,680","\"Listen, that's all you need that really is all you need. He's the fastest thing\""]
["02:01,680","02:07,480","\"Wish that clip of the baby falling was the only animated appearance of Sonic ever\""]
["02:07,480","02:11,040","\"I don't think it would be a very big cartoon\""]
["02:11,040","02:13,960","\"The idea fan of it. I mean, yeah\""]
["02:13,960","02:17,320","\"Every episode could have an exploding baby\""]
["02:17,320","02:18,320","\"the idea.\""]
["02:18,320","02:20,840","\"The eyeball comes out.\""]
["02:20,840","02:21,840","\"It does.\""]
["02:21,840","02:24,120","\"The eyeball comes out.\""]
["02:24,120","02:25,640","\"They wanted it to look really gruesome.\""]
["02:25,640","02:29,440","\"People always cry in that show and they always do the hair gel sound effect.\""]
["02:29,440","02:30,440","\"Oh my god.\""]
["02:30,440","02:33,440","\"This cartoon is trying to be melodramatic.\""]
["02:33,440","02:37,360","\"It's specifically action cartoons trying to be melodramatic.\""]
["02:37,360","02:38,760","\"You just make them cry Julian.\""]
["02:38,760","02:43,400","\"It makes me like, I don't even know what is the emotion.\""]
["02:43,400","02:45,480","\"Like it just makes me grow.\""]
["02:45,480","02:52,520","\"Emotion in the ocean. I don't know if it's too soon to talk about Danny Phantom yet, but that was always one of them for me\""]
["02:52,520","02:56,760","\"Yeah, I always thought it was really embarrassing. Oh, is this title like super lame and I never watched it\""]
["02:56,760","03:03,640","\"I I watched it. I watched every episode when it was on was it cool?\""]
["03:03,640","03:09,160","\"Just no, it was really uncool, but I watched it because you know how I like spooky things and I was like\""]
["03:09,160","03:12,040","\"Oh, I want to go theme superhero. Yeah, stunk\""]
["03:12,040","03:15,080","\"Fucking stunk. Are you sure it stunk Julie?\""]
["03:15,080","03:22,740","\"Did join and it's stunk and I was like 16 years old so that's how you know it's done. Yeah when you're 16 is like what\""]
["03:22,740","03:31,540","\"Friends I don't remember this at all. We probably never did it. I did I beat this game 100%\""]
["03:31,540","03:37,120","\"How come this guy's making funny sounds\""]
["03:37,120","03:39,680","\"He's a man he sounds like a pho-wam\""]
["03:39,680","03:40,680","\"He's done.\""]
["03:40,680","03:41,680","\"Great world.\""]
["03:41,680","03:44,940","\"He should go out, man.\""]
["03:44,940","03:45,940","\"Grab my star.\""]
["03:45,940","03:47,260","\"You won't go far.\""]
["03:47,260","03:48,260","\"Get off the stream.\""]
["03:48,260","03:50,340","\"Oh, this music makes me think of Pikmin.\""]
["03:50,340","03:51,500","\"Always play Pikmin.\""]
["03:51,500","03:52,500","\"Oh, man.\""]
["03:52,500","03:53,900","\"I like Pikmin.\""]
["03:53,900","03:56,020","\"How come there was no purple Pikmin?\""]
["03:56,020","03:57,020","\"There was.\""]
["03:57,020","03:59,260","\"How come there was no purple Pikmin?\""]
["03:59,260","04:00,260","\"There was.\""]
["04:00,260","04:03,900","\"How come there was no transparent foetles, Pikmin?\""]
["04:03,900","04:04,900","\"There was.\""]
["04:04,900","04:09,660","\"What I want to know is why they have this aversion to continuity and the Pikmin.\""]
["04:09,660","04:11,660","\"Yeah\""]
["04:11,660","04:17,340","\"That's true. What do you mean? It's really straight like they'll introduce mechanics and enemies and characters and stuff\""]
["04:17,340","04:24,000","\"And they just never carry over between games. That's weird. I only ever played the first one the second one's a lot of fun\""]
["04:24,000","04:28,820","\"I heard the second one's better. I think the second one is better in terms of being a video game\""]
["04:28,820","04:31,180","\"Yeah, but I like it's a static\""]
["04:31,180","04:37,180","\"First one I think the first one is really grounded in like I haven't played I haven't played free\""]
["04:37,180","04:41,900","\"but it looks like they tried to cut back any strange grossness.\""]
["04:41,900","04:44,300","\"You think so? I think they kind of like exact...\""]
["04:44,300","04:47,820","\"I feel like each installment of the series has been weirder and weirder.\""]
["04:47,820","04:49,980","\"I feel like they cleaned it up a lot more than the third one.\""]
["04:49,980","04:51,660","\"Then tried to...\""]
["04:51,660","04:56,700","\"In the first game, like, I get this impression they were trying to go for like\""]
["04:56,700","04:58,540","\"it being like physically believable.\""]
["04:58,540","04:59,660","\"Well, that's what I meant.\""]
["04:59,660","05:04,860","\"I feel like they made it feel more fantasy-ish as it went on.\""]
["05:05,500","05:07,500","\"Oh, well, yeah, I'm in my room.\""]
["05:07,500","05:12,060","\"I'm saying in that regard, the first game feels--\""]
["05:12,060","05:13,100","\"I don't know.\""]
["05:13,100","05:16,100","\"I want to say dark because that sounds stupid.\""]
["05:16,100","05:19,500","\"But I don't know, more rude in reality in a way that makes it--\""]
["05:19,500","05:20,420","\"I mean dark in certain--\""]
["05:20,420","05:22,860","\"It makes it more uncomfortable feeling because of that.\""]
["05:22,860","05:24,460","\"And you're saying that's a good thing our bad--\""]
["05:24,460","05:25,180","\"Yeah, that's a good thing.\""]
["05:25,180","05:25,900","\"I like that about that.\""]
["05:25,900","05:27,020","\"I mean, I like that a lot, too.\""]
["05:27,020","05:31,860","\"I remember the commercial that they used here in the States\""]
["05:31,860","05:37,220","\"was that it was like they were trying to they were trying to go off that it was\""]
["05:37,220","05:41,260","\"like a nature special like it was a documentary yeah why me and I thought\""]
["05:41,260","05:47,940","\"that fit yeah I think it's a point I like the Japanese commercial a lot too\""]
["05:47,940","05:53,860","\"it made it seem very depressing these little fuckers are killing themselves\""]
["05:53,860","06:00,340","\"all the time pigman yeah Jesse they have no survival instinct Jesse Pinkman\""]
["06:00,340","06:18,340","\"- What if it was... - Here's a cartoon parody for you to do seven years ago. What if it was Jesse Pickman? - And he'd say... - It would get many many... - Stop throwing me bitch! That probably would have happened!\""]
["06:18,340","06:28,340","\"- Mario, Mario... - No, Mario. Mario, Mario. Mario, Mario. Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario, and Luigi, Mario.\""]
["06:28,340","06:34,340","\"- Bob, Mario, and Mario... - Mario, Mario, Mario!\""]
["06:34,340","06:40,340","\"- Uh, the way... - The way he changed it would make some blue spray and it would spray Jesse Pickman.\""]
["06:40,340","06:42,340","\"And Jesse's bigger with me there.\""]
["06:42,340","06:44,340","\"- Jesse, where did you find this? - The increment.\""]
["06:44,340","06:52,220","\"Would you had over here would you would you would you do if Jesse from Toy Story met Jesse from Breaking Bad?\""]
["06:52,220","06:56,420","\"She'd break me bad. You know what I would kind of like that\""]
["06:56,420","07:03,720","\"He'd probably think he was tripping. Whoa what if he was like Sid and he breaks his toys very bad\""]
["07:03,720","07:05,720","\"He's empathetic\""]
["07:05,720","07:08,820","\"Let's do it\""]
["07:08,820","07:13,380","\"He doesn't want to do it at all\""]
["07:13,380","07:18,820","\"What the fuck oh good why can you run up that wall why not\""]
["07:18,820","07:29,180","\"Did they ever bring back the wing cap in any game? I don't think so they brought a backie galaxy. Oh, oh, yeah\""]
["07:29,180","07:31,180","\"I guess that's true\""]
["07:31,180","07:35,900","\"Oh shit what that was did you do that on purpose?\""]
["07:35,900","07:42,900","\"Because that was like really fuck is happening which star you want to get I just opened the door for three of them really\""]
["07:42,900","07:44,900","\"Why did you do that?\""]
["07:44,900","07:46,900","\"I swear that you can't get them all.\""]
["07:46,900","07:47,900","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:47,900","07:50,900","\"People complain about that.\""]
["07:50,900","07:51,900","\"I always just like that by the way.\""]
["07:51,900","07:54,900","\"I never mind it because it makes some sense to me.\""]
["07:54,900","07:57,900","\"For some of the stars when you pick them to do them,\""]
["07:57,900","07:59,900","\"they actually change the level layout.\""]
["07:59,900","08:01,900","\"So it makes sense why sometimes...\""]
["08:01,900","08:03,900","\"They're just on a group of those ones.\""]
