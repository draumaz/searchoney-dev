["02:24,540","02:29,340","\"I'll have the courage to chew you up and spit you out at any colony you want\""]
["02:29,340","02:32,860","\"Okay, you need to get a scooter\""]

["02:46,740","02:50,640","\"You know what this is surprisingly like easy to get around if you actually\""]
["02:50,640","02:56,100","\"Look man just cuz I don't point and scream like a given when I see it doesn't mean I don't see it\""]
["02:56,100","03:00,860","\"I mean it was part of the contrary. Is that aimed at the given in the room?\""]
["03:00,860","03:02,860","\"Well, you signed the contract\""]
["03:02,860","03:09,960","\"Honestly thought the given would make more noise when we record it just sits there. Yeah, it's actually surprisingly quiet\""]
["03:09,960","03:14,300","\"I think it's depressed. I didn't want to say it because I thought it would really bum you out\""]
["03:14,300","03:20,300","\"But the given probably was a bad investment Chris. I've said it before it's getting a pet monkeys are really it's from experience\""]
["03:20,300","03:23,100","\"He's getting a pet monkeys really stupid. It's biting the wire back\""]
["03:23,100","03:28,660","\"I've been gathering these scooters from Earth through some edit if anyone out there wants a given just\""]
["03:28,660","03:35,260","\"Hit me up. I guess if anyone wants a clinically depressed given just know that it was a black mark at Gibbon second\""]
["03:35,260","03:41,420","\"I'm not gonna lie. You're gonna get it like it's not ever gonna feel happy again because of the state of the conditions\""]
["03:41,420","03:44,700","\"We've put it in but we said to it this guy's gonna do something\""]
["03:44,700","03:47,940","\"We have to put his fingers to stop him from like pulling wires and stuff. Yeah\""]
["03:47,940","03:55,940","\"He just has stumps for his there's no teeth no fingers no eyes no ears no nose no nose no no lips\""]
["03:55,940","04:02,920","\"We removed his vocal cords - it's it's it's kind of the equivalent of clipping a cat's fingernail\""]
["04:02,920","04:09,140","\"You know you know when they declaw the cats yeah, yeah, I think what we did was more he made it that I thought it was\""]
["04:09,860","04:11,860","\"But he doesn't really seem happy\""]
["04:11,860","04:14,080","\"We just lays there breathing\""]
["04:14,080","04:16,860","\"Well if you can call that breathing\""]
["04:16,860","04:19,860","\"If you can call that living\""]
["04:19,860","04:25,340","\"Sometimes dead is bitter\""]
["04:25,340","04:31,060","\"Tomar that was a good idea though to have like you know the nutrients directly into his wrist rather than having to feed it\""]
["04:31,060","04:36,420","\"Yeah, but now he's too lazy to chew I tried feeding him a cheeseburger earlier and he just wouldn't take it\""]
["04:36,420","04:39,700","\"He just grabbed the needle again and put it all over the vein from the nutrients\""]
["04:39,700","04:42,260","\"So I guess you know it's funny\""]
["04:42,260","04:45,440","\"I just wanted to test him because I know how he could be and I gave it\""]
["04:45,440","04:47,440","\"I just kind of coyly set down a\""]
["04:47,440","04:51,880","\"Revolver with no bullets and he immediately reached for it tried to you know\""]
["04:51,880","04:58,540","\"No fingers so exactly tried to do it anyways no bolts inside, but it just was a little little fun psychological\""]
["04:59,260","05:04,840","\"A nice little fun thing to just just to show the human versus eighth mind\""]
["05:04,840","05:07,820","\"Experiment I'm ten steps ahead of every day\""]
["05:07,820","05:14,300","\"Every day I try to play games of the video loses. Okay. We get the sap drawers here. We never did give it a name. I\""]
["05:14,300","05:20,860","\"Think what's your name? Yeah, once you name it you start getting attached. I definitely don't want that\""]
["05:20,860","05:25,980","\"Yeah, no, we can't have it feel like it's one of us. Yeah, it's kind of already on the way out\""]
["05:25,980","05:29,060","\"Let's let's be honest. We already offered it to somebody. Yeah\""]
["05:29,060","05:32,500","\"It's died seven times we keep resuscitating it too. Yeah\""]
["05:32,500","05:40,540","\"And every time we do it looks a little angrier that we did it was a good call having all of its nerves like cut out\""]
["05:40,540","05:44,540","\"So you can't feel anything. Yeah, no at least I don't have a feel as bad\""]
["05:44,540","05:49,100","\"And well by the way, this is just sides of you eat the nerves you gain given mind\""]
