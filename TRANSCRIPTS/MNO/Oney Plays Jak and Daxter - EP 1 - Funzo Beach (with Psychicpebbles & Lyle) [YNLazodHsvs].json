["00:13,440","00:14,600","\"He is a naughty dog.\""]

["00:17,480","00:20,000","\"of his asshole for assault in three minutes?\""]
["00:20,000","00:21,800","\"What would you-- if you said put on your 3D glasses,\""]
["00:21,800","00:23,680","\"and he flicked shit at the camera?\""]
["00:23,680","00:24,680","\"[LAUGHING]\""]
["00:24,680","00:26,040","\"What's that guy?\""]
["00:26,040","00:26,600","\"That guy?\""]
["00:26,600","00:27,920","\"That guy's Daxter, dude.\""]
["00:27,920","00:29,500","\"It looks like a fucking idiot.\""]
["00:29,500","00:34,840","\"Obviously didn't spend a lot of time on his human character model because he's only in this opening cut scene\""]
["00:34,840","00:39,340","\"Do you like how every time the camera changes? There's one way right of the in-between point human?\""]
["00:39,340","00:41,700","\"Yeah, he's kind of hideous\""]
["00:41,700","00:43,860","\"Wait, so the plot so that he gets turned into a thing?\""]
["00:43,860","00:45,540","\"Yeah, yeah, he falls into dark putty\""]
["00:45,540","00:49,780","\"He falls into dark putty and nobody really seems to give a fuck except for him\""]
["00:49,780","00:54,300","\"Yeah, I think the dude I'm like mocks him. He was like well good on you. You went to the thing\""]
["00:54,300","00:54,980","\"I told you not to go\""]
["00:54,980","00:59,240","\"I just realized I never do the back so this guy was a person at first. Yeah, it's like it matters\""]
["00:59,240","01:06,860","\"I think that that's the whole premise of why they're doing anything in this game because he's a weasel yeah cuz they\""]
["01:06,860","01:10,060","\"Jack's just like Tom tired of looking at you\""]
["01:10,060","01:13,600","\"Actually, he doesn't talk at all. He doesn't get turned back does he?\""]
["01:13,600","01:17,500","\"No, no when Jack dies he sounds like\""]
["01:21,260","01:27,680","\"She's got a really manly voice. She's got good tits. She does. I like this big phenomenal big natural\""]
["01:27,680","01:33,400","\"Bagoongies. I like big hard tits big hard fake fucking rocks big brick like tits\""]
["01:33,400","01:38,700","\"I love big nippled rocks. I want it to feel like I love the take-ups 75% of the whole dress\""]
["01:38,700","01:39,780","\"I\""]
["01:39,780","01:44,660","\"Don't even like tits. I just want the whole the whole like pectoral region to be an ariola\""]
["01:48,420","01:51,780","\"I remember when I was a kid he says crap right here\""]
["01:51,780","01:57,700","\"He says the seaward\""]
["01:57,700","02:01,460","\"Swore\""]
["02:01,460","02:11,160","\"Yeah, the second game he says is fucking is amazingly it's amazingly edgy really yeah\""]
["02:11,160","02:17,240","\"Jack never talks in this one at all and then in the second one\""]
["02:17,240","02:22,860","\"They like capture at the beginning of the game and like Daxter like wakes him up the first thing he says\""]
["02:22,860","02:24,860","\"He's like I'm gonna kill Praxis\""]
["02:24,860","02:28,720","\"What made what made them give you a voice?\""]
["02:28,720","02:34,900","\"I don't know. They also did the second one is like a GTA type thing and they didn't call a Jack and Dexter\""]
["02:34,900","02:39,160","\"They called it Jack yeah, what's what's the worst? Where would they say the second one?\""]
["02:39,160","02:44,240","\"I think I think that they they're kind of on par with like the Simpsons. So they definitely say hell and damn\""]
["02:44,240","02:49,760","\"I think they say bastard. I don't know. They say flim. Do they say big shit splatter?\""]
["02:49,760","02:53,480","\"Yeah, Jack walks out of the toilet he slips on his shit\""]
["02:53,480","02:57,960","\"And then he just he just like instinctively shouts the N words\""]
["02:57,960","03:04,160","\"Everybody looks out of me. He's just like look I come from a culture where that we just said that all the time\""]
["03:04,160","03:06,360","\"You know I have lots of black friends\""]
["03:06,360","03:09,000","\"This guy's all I just went long\""]
["03:09,000","03:12,120","\"I remember the first time I saw this lip sync it blew my mind\""]
["03:12,920","03:18,520","\"This game did a lot of things that at the time was super ambitious and now is just an everything\""]
["03:18,520","03:24,320","\"No, even now lip sync isn't this good. You have all these weird Mass Effect games where the mouse just flap up and down\""]
["03:24,320","03:28,540","\"Yeah, that's true. It's because they're usually like the principles of how to\""]
["03:28,540","03:34,640","\"That ball move guys nobody objectified her for wearing that. Please don't be safe. That's Bulma briefs\""]
["03:34,640","03:42,400","\"She is set up to be Jack's love interest through the first two games and then the third one she's in it for like three seconds\""]
["03:42,400","03:46,680","\"She has like two lines and I think that they're copy-pasted from other games\""]
["03:46,680","03:51,480","\"I think something happened with like the voice actress or something and rather than bring her back. They just\""]
["03:51,480","03:55,800","\"Why did they did we're running or something? Yeah, something like that. I don't know. I don't know the exact story\""]
["03:55,800","03:58,980","\"So happy with Bob played through she asked for money. They fucking shot\""]
["03:58,980","04:09,840","\"It's like that this game is very silly you guys notice that every time the camera changes\""]
["04:09,840","04:15,120","\"There's like one frame in between of the in between point of the cameras the cameras tweening around really quick\""]
["04:15,120","04:17,120","\"Yeah, yeah, there's\""]
["04:17,120","04:20,840","\"There is that one weird. Oh, yeah, I just saw right there. Yeah every time look\""]
["04:20,840","04:24,120","\"We are playing this on the PlayStation 4\""]
["04:24,120","04:30,900","\"So don't yell at us for that yell at the PlayStation 4 the console in existence\""]
["04:30,900","04:37,520","\"And make sure make sure in your angry letter to the PlayStation for the console to say what were they thinking?\""]
["04:37,760","04:39,760","\"What you're doing skink about\""]
["04:39,760","04:44,200","\"17 like 2001 I want to say this cannot be the\""]
["04:44,200","04:50,400","\"2000s 2001 this is this is not the 2000 work graphics though. It is it is but it's upscaled\""]
["04:50,400","04:55,280","\"That's still pretty quick 2001. Yeah, you know think they improved\""]
["04:55,280","05:00,720","\"Look how much like squash and stretch they use on this\""]
["05:04,400","05:09,080","\"I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that this is it's not a launch game for the PS2\""]
["05:09,080","05:11,920","\"But it came out very shortly after look\""]
["05:11,920","05:16,520","\"It's the special egg when you reunite the pieces of the egg with the inside of the egg\""]
["05:16,520","05:20,420","\"It's just a circle and it's not special. That's what my uterus and that's what you have to do\""]
["05:20,420","05:22,420","\"You have to go and make it not special no more\""]
["05:22,420","05:26,800","\"That reminds me of Bubsy 3d that music\""]
["05:26,800","05:33,480","\"The like was it there? What did you just came out? Mmm new Bubsy? Yeah, yeah, but it was just uh\""]
["05:33,480","05:36,820","\"I think it was literally made just so they could keep the IP or something\""]
["05:36,820","05:44,740","\"You think or do you think that they were trying to get let's players like you no it was definitely the least amount of effort\""]
["05:44,740","05:46,740","\"They could have possibly done\""]
["05:46,740","05:49,380","\"I think it was I\""]
["05:49,380","05:54,240","\"Think it was a literally for the iPhone I think it was an iPhone game and they just put their graphics on it\""]
["05:54,240","05:57,220","\"What was this was a race for was really\""]
["05:57,220","05:59,500","\"It's on steam and everything\""]
["06:00,220","06:04,060","\"He says well I can pass. I'm right. What fucking go wrong?\""]
["06:04,060","06:08,700","\"And then a man comes out behind him\""]
["06:08,700","06:11,460","\"Shokes him to death\""]
["06:11,460","06:13,460","\"Daxter's being rude. Oh\""]
["06:13,460","06:17,280","\"He's so corny. He's finally he does if you die\""]
["06:17,280","06:21,900","\"He'll like shit talk you and I always found that a little weird as a kid\""]
["06:21,900","06:26,060","\"Yeah, we're like you're a fucking limp corpse. He's like say good night Jack\""]
["06:26,060","06:30,000","\"What the fuck they actually they animated his cloaca up close\""]
["06:30,000","06:34,020","\"They had a big sea boy who's pussy to his butthole\""]
["06:34,020","06:37,540","\"You should see man\""]
["06:37,540","06:41,380","\"Those little big seas see that little see me have done your balls. They had a big that see I\""]
["06:41,380","06:44,280","\"Was wondering what what is the point of that little seam?\""]
["06:44,280","06:46,980","\"What does that do?\""]
["06:46,980","06:54,800","\"What are you talking about on your on your nuts? There's a seam down the middle of stitching. Yeah, it's like God stitched it up\""]
["06:54,800","06:58,160","\"Yeah, it's like a bad texture meeting.\""]
["06:58,160","06:58,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:58,660","07:04,500","\"You know, uh, once you rip that seed open, you can't stitch it back together.\""]
["07:04,500","07:07,040","\"Let's open it up. What do you find inside?\""]
["07:07,040","07:08,100","\"Pandora's cock.\""]

["07:22,480","07:24,640","\"Now, but really, this game is a classic.\""]
["07:24,640","07:26,640","\"*Laughter*\""]
["07:26,640","07:32,640","\"Hey, little boy, I used to wake up on Saturday morning and stare at the asshole for hours.\""]
["07:32,640","07:33,640","\"Go that, do that.\""]
["07:33,640","07:38,640","\"When I first played this game, by review I was going to say what is this a fucking fart,\""]
["07:38,640","07:40,640","\"but I decided not to say that to not be offensive.\""]
["07:40,640","07:43,640","\"You know when Daxter breakdances when you pick up the egg?\""]
["07:43,640","07:44,640","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:44,640","07:46,640","\"That's cultural appropriation?\""]
["07:46,640","07:48,640","\"He does not own that kind of dance.\""]
["07:48,640","07:49,640","\"How do you know?\""]
["07:49,640","07:51,640","\"But then again, he did turn into a weasel.\""]
["07:51,640","07:56,360","\"You know what you said created it in this fictional universe. That's a good point. I don't know that\""]
["07:56,360","08:01,900","\"But then again, you're not supposed to take cultures and put them into fiction. Yep. Yep. Okay. Yep\""]
["08:01,900","08:06,060","\"All right. Yep, you're supposed to make them owls. You're supposed to make up your own cultures\""]
["08:06,060","08:08,060","\"You make a mouths and then you can do it\""]
["08:08,060","08:12,880","\"He says I love every culture. That's what he says. We can see any points up and down real quick\""]
["08:12,880","08:20,020","\"Because this is the sky and this is the floor and the direction between them\""]
["08:20,020","08:23,020","\"The amount of room is how much I respect different cultures.\""]
["08:23,020","08:29,520","\"Has there ever been a case where somebody looked like they were wearing blackface, but they really weren't and they got in big trouble over it?\""]
["08:29,520","08:35,020","\"There was somebody that fucking, uh, drew on their face with permanent marker.\""]
["08:35,020","08:36,020","\"I think that did happen.\""]
["08:36,020","08:39,020","\"And they got- it fucking stained their skin somehow.\""]
["08:39,020","08:41,020","\"Forever? Yeah, I think.\""]
["08:41,020","08:44,020","\"Or at least for a long period of time.\""]
["08:44,020","08:46,020","\"I feel like that's something that would happen.\""]
["08:46,020","08:52,520","\"I swear to god that did happen. I think that happened recently somebody got you for I know that somebody got called a Nazi for\""]
["08:52,520","08:56,140","\"Having a shaved head and it took that thing some kind of rare fucking I remember that\""]
["08:56,140","09:03,460","\"It'll look like big hoopy cushions. They look like big scary boog. I\""]
["09:03,460","09:09,500","\"Remember this level. This is called funzo beach and you get to run funzo down the beach\""]
["09:09,500","09:14,120","\"What would you do if there was a gigantic bug that came to your house in high heels?\""]
["09:14,120","09:21,700","\"I would first off I would uh I would open the door if there was a huge bug walking around\""]
["09:21,700","09:26,480","\"I would I would try to kind of go to the room with no windows and the least amount of doors\""]
["09:26,480","09:28,480","\"What kind of bug was it?\""]
["09:28,480","09:34,820","\"Yeah, what was it? Let's just say it's like a big cockroach cricket. Crickets not so bad that it did\""]
["09:34,820","09:39,100","\"It looked kind of scary, but not they're not they were inflated to a gigantic size. They'd be skilled\""]
["09:39,840","09:44,240","\"What kind of high heels is like ruby red beautiful high heels and also is the cricket a woman\""]
["09:44,240","09:49,020","\"There's obviously a female let let's say it's unclear as to whether this thing had a height\""]
["09:49,020","09:52,240","\"It's definitely got cricket level intelligence\""]
["09:52,240","09:57,480","\"But it's got high heels on so either somebody else put the high heels on it or\""]
["09:57,480","10:02,740","\"Or like stomp through a shoe store or something\""]
["10:02,740","10:08,040","\"Cricut's bite dude. I've been there before I be a fight do they have a bit like\""]
["10:08,560","10:10,560","\"When you bite back\""]
["10:10,560","10:18,320","\"You gotta establish dominance over the cricket if you if you pour milk on a cricket they become a milk cricket\""]
["10:18,320","10:22,600","\"Yeah, then they produce milk. There's a little evolution. That's a life hack\""]
["10:22,600","10:27,880","\"Yeah, and if you if you drink cricket from a milk from a cricket you'll become\""]
["10:27,880","10:35,120","\"You know that they trained goats they trained goats to produce spider silk out of their titties\""]
["10:35,120","10:38,320","\"I remember that they said goats you better do it and the goats did it\""]
