["16:57,480","17:01,260","\"They should make good games for cool guys like me, you know?\""]
["17:01,260","17:03,020","\"Do you have any suggestions?\""]
["17:03,020","17:07,060","\"Yeah, there's a game I've been wanting to make since I was a child. It's called\""]
["17:07,060","17:10,100","\"Game for Child. It's uh...\""]
["17:10,100","17:11,100","\"What are you doing game for child?\""]
["17:11,100","17:13,100","\"You spawn in as a child\""]
["17:13,100","17:18,860","\"But you've got really long legs longer than all the adults and you can kick them up into the air\""]
["17:18,860","17:26,940","\"And then when they fall on the ground you can step on their heads and you can push the circle to say I am the adult now\""]
["17:26,940","17:29,860","\"Well, I was gonna say I'm not interested until that point\""]
["17:29,860","17:33,440","\"Can we figure out a good way to work that in?\""]
["17:33,440","17:38,720","\"But the whole the whole point of the game is you have to like hack hacky sack parents up in the air\""]
["17:38,720","17:42,940","\"Whenever they're mean to you. They're like pick up your toy and you hacky sack\""]
["17:42,940","17:45,940","\"Can we make it more biased to what\""]
["17:47,380","17:50,020","\"I like it this music was playing through here.\""]
["17:50,020","17:53,000","\"There's also many games.\""]
["17:53,000","17:55,660","\"Like your parents will knock on your door and be like, \"\"Are you okay?\"\"\""]
["17:55,660","17:59,380","\"And if you push triangle, you throw darts into their head.\""]
["17:59,380","18:00,380","\"It's like minecraft.\""]
["18:00,380","18:01,380","\"It's like minecraft.\""]
["18:01,380","18:05,260","\"You have to keep your parents out of your room and you build a Lego wall to keep them\""]
["18:05,260","18:06,260","\"out.\""]
["18:06,260","18:07,260","\"Yeah.\""]

["18:25,020","18:26,920","\"You know what I was thinking about today?\""]
["18:26,920","18:28,920","\"Why is there not more games kind of like Toombi\""]
["18:28,920","18:31,920","\"where you can like jump on things and grab them and flip them around?\""]
["18:31,920","18:32,420","\"I don't know.\""]
["18:32,420","18:33,420","\"Guacamele is a good one.\""]
["18:33,420","18:35,420","\"Running around in Toombi so far?\""]

["18:36,420","18:38,020","\"You know Guacamele is all that.\""]
["18:38,020","18:40,320","\"It's just punching and grabbing things and throwing them around.\""]
["18:40,320","18:43,020","\"Guacamele has got fucking Shovel Knight references though.\""]
["18:43,020","18:45,020","\"No, it doesn't. It was before Shovel Knight.\""]
["18:45,020","18:50,200","\"Um, it has meme references though. That is true. Oh, it has Tom Fulp's face in it though. Does it really?\""]
["18:50,200","18:55,060","\"It has castle crashes everywhere. It's a screaming face. It's imprisoned within the game. You have to free him\""]
["18:55,060","19:00,940","\"That's where he's been all this time. There are certain aesthetics. I just don't like like I don't like\""]
["19:00,940","19:06,900","\"Wrestling Mexican wrestling stuff. I think mucha lucha actually drove it into my head to hate that stuff. Oh, really?\""]
["19:06,900","19:13,720","\"I love it. Actual, extra lucha rematches are amazing. Yeah, they're cool. Maybe I should actually watch one and not just remember\""]
["19:13,720","19:19,440","\"Just watch not your libre and you're set. I love not your libre. There we go. What's your problem with lucha doors?\""]

["19:21,720","19:30,000","\"Chris watch doesn't get excited unbelievable watch lucha underground. It's all about Aztec treasures and demons in wrestling form\""]
["19:30,000","19:35,600","\"I'm sorry just certain things just don't interest me like the Aztecs\""]
["19:35,600","19:41,920","\"Why were they old and stupid why would they drink blood? Why did they die? That killed you?\""]

["20:02,240","20:06,960","\"Yeah, well, it's because people don't do much with them. Yeah, they should because you know\""]
["20:06,960","20:10,520","\"Most deserts are just flat plains of sand just not like it's true\""]
["20:10,520","20:13,840","\"That's what the inspiration is usually job for but there are pretty deserts\""]
["20:13,840","20:19,480","\"I feel like you'd be creative with if you have some structures and I'm like actual like history or anything like that. Yeah\""]
["20:19,480","20:27,380","\"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's fine. I'm being a tear down all the desert. I'm being a contrarian\""]
