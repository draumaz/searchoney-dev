["00:17,000","00:23,000","\"\"\"Just because I like seeing horses falling over.\"\" \"\"Have you seen the video of the horse trying to jump over the bar and he just fucking flops over it?\"\"\""]
["00:23,000","00:28,000","\"\"\"No, look it up.\"\" \"\"Does he die?\"\" \"\"I don't know, maybe.\"\"\""]
["00:28,000","00:30,200","\"If a horse breaks his legs, you gotta shoot him in the head.\""]
["00:30,200","00:31,040","\"- That's true.\""]
["00:31,040","00:32,440","\"- You know, fun fact.\""]
["00:32,440","00:36,920","\"Horses' legs are the same kind of bone structure\""]
["00:36,920","00:38,800","\"as we have in like our fingers.\""]
["00:38,800","00:40,640","\"- Really? - Really?\""]
["00:40,640","00:43,040","\"- I'm 90% sure that that was true,\""]
["00:43,040","00:45,640","\"and if that's not true, somebody lied to me,\""]
["00:45,640","00:47,040","\"and it's not my fault.\""]
["00:47,040","00:48,640","\"- Here's another toothpick.\""]
["00:48,640","00:49,480","\"(both laughing)\""]
["00:49,480","00:51,000","\"Our fingers are made out of toothpicks,\""]
["00:51,000","00:52,400","\"so that's why they break so easily.\""]
["00:52,400","00:54,640","\"- It's also why if you do a horse running motion\""]
["00:54,640","00:57,200","\"with your fingers, it actually looks exactly,\""]
["00:57,200","00:59,780","\"Like it is exactly- - Doesn't look too dissimilar.\""]
["00:59,780","01:00,620","\"- No, it's not.\""]
["01:00,620","01:02,840","\"Ratio wise, it's actually exactly the same.\""]
["01:02,840","01:03,680","\"- Did you see that?\""]
["01:03,680","01:07,340","\"This is a very believable lie, if it's not true.\""]
["01:07,340","01:08,860","\"- Oh, that's cool.\""]
["01:08,860","01:10,780","\"I've not played this in a while.\""]
["01:10,780","01:12,660","\"- Oh, it's good that you figured out how to do that.\""]
["01:12,660","01:13,500","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:13,500","01:14,340","\"- I remember that time you were like,\""]

["01:15,260","01:17,120","\"- Do you know how to do that?\""]
["01:17,120","01:18,700","\"- Oh wait, no, I didn't need to do better in Lilon Pro.\""]
["01:18,700","01:20,820","\"- So does this mean you need to go everywhere?\""]
["01:20,820","01:21,660","\"Oh, there you go.\""]
["01:21,660","01:22,740","\"You were like,\""]

["01:44,580","01:47,860","\"Wait, do I go down?\""]
["01:47,860","01:51,700","\"Good horse\""]
["01:53,780","02:00,500","\"Complimenting the horse for not literally killing itself. I wanted it because you told it to and read that redemption\""]
["02:00,500","02:05,500","\"You can make the horses kill themselves. Yeah, should I go down here? Is that what I'm doing? Yes? Yeah? Oh\""]
["02:05,500","02:11,060","\"On the right way. Yeah, I like that exposure. It's always nice\""]
["02:11,060","02:14,900","\"But would you worry that water it looks like water\""]
["02:14,900","02:19,820","\"Can I get down there? Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's making there's like that path to the right\""]

["03:49,060","03:55,340","\"I just I didn't think the horse would take oh\""]
["03:55,340","03:58,420","\"That was now you got to turn around\""]
["03:58,420","04:00,580","\"What the fuck?\""]
["04:00,580","04:06,860","\"Wait, I guess that was around you get that was a scene that was supposed to trigger when you went across that bridge\""]
["04:06,860","04:12,460","\"But you kind of fucking broke it by doing an epic speedrun trick and diving off\""]
["04:12,460","04:16,660","\"Hey, can you try that trick again? Yeah, how about good?\""]
["04:16,660","04:18,660","\"*screams*\""]
["04:18,660","04:24,780","\"Oh, he bonked his noodle. You just see fucking like the red nist.\""]

["04:34,560","04:37,720","\"Oh, also look at that. We see it from a better angle this time.\""]
["04:37,720","04:42,260","\"Yeah, that's the thing about this game is that the animations are all nice and flowing\""]
["04:42,260","04:48,320","\"but to make that work into a game that makes the game control funky and it does seem that all the cinematics are in-game\""]
["04:48,320","04:52,420","\"Graphers, yeah, yeah, the games that control best always have real jerky animations\""]
["04:52,420","05:00,140","\"There is something to be said about that is animating for games is a lot different than animating period\""]
["05:00,140","05:04,260","\"Yeah, you got to make it real punchy. Yeah, really punchy and snappy\""]
["05:04,260","05:10,260","\"If you break down frame by frame a lot of fighting game animations and stuff like that\""]
["05:10,260","05:15,220","\"They don't make a lot of logistical sense, but and a lot of them are like four frames. Yeah, yeah\""]
["05:15,220","05:22,740","\"Fucking uh, so is fucking cloudy with a chance of meatballs. There was so few in between so good. No, it was great. I\""]
["05:22,740","05:27,220","\"Love that movie every time the meatball showed up I laughed\""]
["05:27,220","05:36,340","\"I have not seen cloudy with a chance of meatballs if that comment was not good. Oh that fucking you've never seen it that whole\""]
["05:36,340","05:38,340","\"Over there. It looks like Moses from the side\""]
["05:39,180","05:42,760","\"The human being yeah, oh like his beard\""]
["05:42,760","05:47,480","\"I kind of see it on the left and his upper lip is like the Grinch and he's got his neck down there\""]
["05:47,480","05:51,500","\"Also, I don't want to drown this horse. Are you having a joke? What are you talking about?\""]
["05:51,500","05:53,700","\"What are you see? Oh?\""]
["05:53,700","05:56,180","\"That was actually pathetic\""]

["06:08,660","06:16,460","\"I got fucking sucked. Okay. I got sucked under a wave and it was fun. Also, this reminds me of Jason and the Aragonauts the movie\""]
["06:16,460","06:19,540","\"Those thing Argonauts\""]
["06:19,540","06:24,740","\"Jesus Christ. Okay. Come on. You fucking horse. Is this made by the same people made I go. Yeah. Yes\""]
["06:24,740","06:30,380","\"I thought the fucking guy would have walked I go. Yeah, I did. I've never played it. That's weird\""]
["06:30,380","06:33,180","\"You've played I go, but you haven't played shadow the Colossus. Yes\""]
["06:34,020","06:41,820","\"Strange I had a bootleg copy when I was living in Asia really yeah cuz this was kind of their their breakthrough game\""]
["06:41,820","06:46,940","\"And then people went back and played I go it's not common that you see it go the other way\""]
["06:46,940","06:50,900","\"I don't think I ever beat the first level. Oh\""]
["06:50,900","06:53,700","\"There you go me too\""]

["07:22,220","07:27,060","\"I know what what it would be like notice what you were doing and got super defensive\""]
["07:28,300","07:33,940","\"Hold on sir, it's not just weird and skittish like he starts sliding his feet back over the sand\""]
["07:33,940","07:35,940","\"Yeah, he knows you're on his feet\""]
