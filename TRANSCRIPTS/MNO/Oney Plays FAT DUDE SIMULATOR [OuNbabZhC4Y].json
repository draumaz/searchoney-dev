["04:19,860","04:24,820","\"I'm just gonna say like, there's all these little things scattered throughout this beautiful giant map.\""]
["04:24,820","04:27,300","\"It looks like there's something in there. There's a note on the ground.\""]
["04:27,300","04:30,700","\"That's what I mean. There's gotta be a way to open these buildings. I would just put these here for no reason.\""]
["04:30,700","04:31,900","\"Okay, I'm gonna try every button.\""]

["04:37,140","04:39,340","\"Well, do it, do it on the door first. You're just doing it against the wall.\""]
["04:39,340","04:40,500","\"Okay.\""]
["04:40,500","04:44,300","\"I don't think I can even walk up this fucking page.\""]

["04:57,460","05:04,380","\"Red-haring it. Yeah, you can't even go. What would that ladder take you to you? Maybe you could fucking jump on the roof through a hole\""]
["05:04,380","05:07,660","\"I don't know so there's one forest nymph chasing a fat\""]
["05:07,660","05:12,260","\"I mean, what else would he be doing?\""]
["05:14,300","05:20,660","\"Like a guys are calling it a forest nymph. It's just looks like a generic zombie or something low to war. Oh\""]
["05:20,660","05:24,380","\"Wow, you really coded in that it's harder to go\""]
["05:24,380","05:29,820","\"Rabbities like exponentially getting harder. It seems to run okay\""]

["05:35,660","05:36,540","\"Be cool\""]
["05:36,540","05:38,140","\"There's like a role feature like sonic\""]
["05:38,140","05:43,200","\"Seems like it might just be a bunch of like prefabricated objects from like a unity demo game\""]
["05:43,200","05:46,700","\"Did this game have reviews or did you just what did you type it if you've invited us? That's true\""]
["05:46,700","05:48,700","\"What how did you find this? Uh?\""]
["05:48,700","05:51,360","\"I just went on steam just look at new games\""]
["05:51,360","05:58,120","\"So this way that is a glowing thing in the distance or I thought I saw something like to the left\""]
["05:58,120","06:03,120","\"That's where we came from oh, let's just find the force sniff and die to it and move on to the next game\""]
["06:03,660","06:10,260","\"No, I feel like we have to do at least one thing that be far a little fire. I think that's where we started\""]
["06:10,260","06:16,740","\"That was the original fire. I think yeah, despite his bite of breaking bad little RV thing that was the original fire. Yeah\""]
["06:16,740","06:20,420","\"Can't even touch the Jesus\""]
