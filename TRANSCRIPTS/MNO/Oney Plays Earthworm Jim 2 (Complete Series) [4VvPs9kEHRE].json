["00:18,400","00:20,440","\"Hi everybody, we're playing Earthworm Jim 2.\""]
["00:20,440","00:22,960","\"This is the Stinky Sega Saturn port event.\""]
["00:22,960","00:24,440","\"Why are we playing this one?\""]
["00:24,440","00:25,800","\"'Cause it's the one night.\""]

["00:28,400","00:29,440","\"How do you like the look of it?\""]
["00:29,440","00:37,180","\"Not good. This is probably the rock gnarne. He's cute. Oh, we're joined by a mean and cousin bunkers\""]

["00:52,800","00:58,620","\"Don't want to say it's hard. I just not very good at it. It's okay. It takes some getting used to\""]
["00:58,620","01:02,220","\"Or something Jim really likes despicable me. That's why he keeps going\""]
["01:02,220","01:03,220","\"\"\"WOO!\"\"\""]
["01:03,220","01:05,220","\"Was this on Sega Genesis?\""]
["01:05,220","01:08,720","\"Yeah, this was on Genesis, it was on Super Nintendo's on E-me.\""]
["01:08,720","01:10,320","\"Did it have the same music?\""]
["01:10,320","01:12,320","\"It did not have the whole...\""]
["01:12,320","01:17,320","\"That's one of the things he always hears like people arguing over which the soundtrack is better.\""]
["01:17,320","01:18,320","\"Yeah, no, the...\""]
["01:18,320","01:20,320","\"And the Genesis I would say is better for you.\""]
["01:20,320","01:22,320","\"Genesis version is really good.\""]
["01:22,320","01:23,320","\"Wait, really?\""]
["01:23,320","01:24,320","\"But, uh, I like this one too.\""]
["01:24,320","01:26,320","\"Well, this is the actual CD quality audio.\""]
["01:26,320","01:27,320","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:27,320","01:31,560","\"That's the one positive thing about the Sega Saturn version.\""]
["01:31,560","01:33,160","\"Is that good music?\""]
["01:33,160","01:34,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:34,160","01:36,400","\"That's the way it's meant to sound.\""]

["01:37,400","01:38,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:38,400","01:41,680","\"Do you like this one or the first one more?\""]
["01:41,680","01:46,600","\"It's a toss-up because I think some stages in this are very fun.\""]
["01:46,600","01:51,240","\"But the first game is more emphasis on platforming and this has some pretty lousy stages here\""]
["01:51,240","01:52,240","\"and there.\""]
["01:52,240","01:55,080","\"I fucking hate the flying king.\""]

["02:17,080","02:18,080","\"*laughs*\""]

["02:30,720","02:36,480","\"Gonna toss you in the granny chair to be fair. I just go out and get her some more worms\""]
["02:36,480","02:43,720","\"Why would you kill the worms and just get her new worms so so they live forever according to her perception\""]
["02:43,720","02:48,580","\"What if a worms died it would devastate her so I keep replacing them\""]
["02:52,380","02:55,220","\"What the fuck is this mechanic in the first level?\""]
["02:55,220","03:06,980","\"Between in between there we go and now go fast\""]

["03:26,940","03:27,940","\"Doesn't.\""]
["03:27,940","03:29,940","\"There's a big pile of them.\""]

["03:33,940","03:36,940","\"My pussy flourishes in your presence.\""]
["03:36,940","03:40,940","\"They have awareness of the fact that they're in a video game and they can perceive the outside\""]
["03:40,940","03:41,940","\"world.\""]
["03:41,940","03:43,940","\"That's just a grandma's head on a spike.\""]

["06:13,340","06:14,180","\"When did they start?\""]
["06:14,180","06:15,980","\"- Yeah, because of Earth from Jim.\""]
["06:15,980","06:17,540","\"- No, Earth from Jim was popular.\""]
["06:17,540","06:20,140","\"Like when did they start doing those ads?\""]
["06:20,140","06:22,460","\"- When Earth from Jim was popular.\""]
["06:22,460","06:23,300","\"- Was it popular?\""]
["06:23,300","06:26,140","\"- Yeah, actually, I think it was like early 2000s.\""]
["06:26,140","06:27,740","\"- No, for a minute.\""]
["06:27,740","06:29,260","\"- I remember them doing it back in the middle.\""]
["06:29,260","06:30,500","\"- Oh, Minecraft.\""]
["06:30,500","06:33,540","\"- They got a TV series.\""]

["06:38,300","06:40,300","\"18 double boogermann.\""]
["06:40,300","06:45,740","\"Well, by the way, that was without Doug to maple even being aware of it.\""]
["06:45,740","06:48,700","\"So you're saying on Twitter, like, I have no idea they were doing this.\""]
["06:48,700","06:49,700","\"Good.\""]
["06:49,700","06:51,500","\"Because they have the right certs from Jim now.\""]

["06:52,500","06:54,500","\"I did not know that happened.\""]
["06:54,500","06:55,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:55,500","06:59,380","\"They were saying, like, oh, the new boogermann game will have Earthworm Jim as a co-op partner\""]
["06:59,380","07:00,380","\"for no reason.\""]
["07:00,380","07:02,700","\"It's just going to be like the Morgan sprite.\""]
["07:02,700","07:04,540","\"They just dropped him into the same abilities.\""]
["07:04,540","07:05,540","\"That would be good.\""]
["07:05,540","07:07,540","\"I said because you just\""]

["07:15,780","07:20,820","\"Because he needs a cute little side. He's like it acts like a dog in the car to none of the cartoon\""]
["07:20,820","07:25,420","\"But in the game is his snot yeah, that's called snot don't you think snot is really cute no\""]

["08:10,760","08:13,660","\"It's probably just from Jim now. I'm gonna be after the 3d game\""]
["08:13,660","08:16,660","\"Because that was no good\""]
["08:16,660","08:21,220","\"I think it was before them because they had him in clay fighter\""]
["08:21,220","08:24,460","\"Should I wasn't just a favor?\""]
["08:24,460","08:26,660","\"Did you say you don't like this board?\""]
["08:27,540","08:29,540","\"Not really what's wrong with it?\""]
["08:29,540","08:34,920","\"It's off in really strange ways they updated visuals to those 3d renders and everything\""]
["08:34,920","08:42,060","\"It's gonna say also the background in the first level. Yeah a lot nicer. They they screw up some backdrops in this\""]

["08:57,300","09:02,580","\"I already hate doing it controls even worse than this one. So it's the pizza pasta song it does\""]
