["00:04,280","00:05,400","\"\"\"With friends.\"\"\""]
["00:05,400","00:07,200","\"It was a game designer that posted that-\""]
["00:07,200","00:09,200","\"Do you see that thing? I reached me on Twitter.\""]
["00:09,200","00:13,840","\"The guy who's like the old Tomb Raider, maybe janky and horrible, but it's 50 times better.\""]
["00:13,840","00:17,920","\"No, no, the one that was like whenever I see like, decorative peril.\""]
["00:17,920","00:19,360","\"It just makes me think of this.\""]
["00:19,360","00:20,440","\"What's decorative peril?\""]
["00:20,440","00:26,440","\"Decorative peril is like, it doesn't in this game too, where it's like, there's like a little cutscene where you like, fall or something, but like, it's supposed to happen.\""]
["00:26,440","00:27,640","\"Oh fucking hate that shit!\""]
["00:27,640","00:28,800","\"So it doesn't matter. You don't feel it.\""]
["00:28,800","00:29,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:29,480","00:31,480","\"And Tomb Raider is full of that.\""]
["00:31,480","00:31,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:31,980","00:34,480","\"So it's like, you know, she's like climbing up a wall or something,\""]
["00:34,480","00:36,980","\"and there's like all this wind and shit and like stuff's breaking,\""]
["00:36,980","00:38,680","\"but you're literally just holding up.\""]
["00:38,680","00:39,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:39,180","00:40,280","\"It's the same as this.\""]
["00:40,280","00:41,480","\"Yeah, exactly.\""]
["00:41,480","00:43,980","\"I mean, the Tomb Raider game is literally this.\""]
["00:43,980","00:46,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:46,480","00:47,980","\"Like, I almost think that...\""]
["00:47,980","00:49,980","\"The Tomb Raider is more of a parody of this, though.\""]
["00:49,980","00:53,280","\"It's a parody of this, but like...\""]
["00:53,280","00:54,280","\"Not...\""]
["00:54,280","00:56,080","\"It's a parody...\""]
["00:56,080","00:58,080","\"But it's trying to be it, you know?\""]
["00:58,080","00:58,380","\"Yep.\""]
["00:58,380","00:58,880","\"Totally.\""]
["00:58,880","01:00,340","\"It's like the Simpsons and Family Guy.\""]
["01:00,340","01:02,040","\"Except the Family Guy.\""]
["01:02,040","01:04,600","\"It got better and then it got really bad.\""]
["01:04,600","01:05,440","\"- Oh my god.\""]
["01:05,440","01:06,880","\"Season two of Family Guy was really good.\""]
["01:06,880","01:09,000","\"- So that season three's pretty good too.\""]
["01:09,000","01:11,360","\"Even season one has a few good parts.\""]
["01:11,360","01:14,040","\"But season two was the hotspot for me.\""]
["01:14,040","01:17,920","\"Then everything that came after is mostly just hot trash.\""]
["01:17,920","01:20,080","\"- To love and die in Dixie is the best episode.\""]
["01:20,080","01:21,200","\"- Yeah, that's what everyone says.\""]
["01:21,200","01:22,400","\"- It's like non-stop laughs.\""]
["01:22,400","01:23,720","\"- My favorite episode is the one where Peter\""]
["01:23,720","01:26,640","\"goes back to school and he's like, it's like Greece.\""]
["01:26,640","01:27,840","\"(laughs)\""]
["01:27,840","01:28,840","\"I don't remember that one.\""]
["01:28,840","01:29,840","\"It's funny.\""]
["01:29,840","01:34,760","\"I've seen every family guy up to season four and then I stopped watching so much.\""]
["01:34,760","01:38,360","\"I've seen like every American dad though that shows fucking garbage.\""]
["01:38,360","01:39,360","\"Everyone?\""]
["01:39,360","01:40,600","\"There's a couple that are okay.\""]
["01:40,600","01:43,200","\"It's better than Family Guy right now that's for sure.\""]
["01:43,200","01:44,720","\"Oh shit dude.\""]
["01:44,720","01:47,760","\"American Dad has one episode that I thought was genius from start to finish.\""]
["01:47,760","01:49,040","\"I saw it on an airplane.\""]
["01:49,040","01:50,040","\"Which one?\""]
["01:50,040","01:51,040","\"It's like making fun of spy movies.\""]
["01:51,040","01:52,240","\"Oh he's going to do the loading screen thing.\""]
["01:52,240","01:53,640","\"Look, oh the area is loading.\""]
["01:53,640","01:54,640","\"Thank God this is here.\""]
["01:54,640","01:55,640","\"Whew.\""]
["01:55,640","01:57,040","\"Yeah there we go it's all loaded now.\""]
["01:57,040","01:57,880","\"- Right.\""]
["01:57,880","02:00,400","\"- I mean, that's clever.\""]
["02:00,400","02:02,680","\"- It's clever, but it's fucking obvious at this point.\""]
["02:02,680","02:04,960","\"If Final Fantasy 7, the remake does that now too.\""]
["02:04,960","02:09,200","\"Like verbatim the exact same way.\""]
["02:09,200","02:10,880","\"- The Final Fantasy 7 remake?\""]
["02:10,880","02:11,720","\"- Mm-hmm.\""]
["02:11,720","02:12,720","\"- Why, did you see footage of it?\""]
["02:12,720","02:14,680","\"- Yeah, Cloud's like pushing himself through like,\""]
["02:14,680","02:18,060","\"literally it is exactly the same as what just happened.\""]
["02:18,060","02:22,360","\"- Well, would you rather just be a black screen\""]
["02:22,360","02:24,160","\"this is loading with a percentage bar?\""]
["02:24,160","02:25,320","\"- I'm not saying it's the worst way.\""]
["02:25,320","02:28,960","\"I definitely think it's better than a loading screen, but Dark Souls handles it the best\""]
["02:28,960","02:32,720","\"You're still playing but it blocks like shit with trees and stuff\""]
["02:32,720","02:37,720","\"Like I think there's points in Dark Souls where you can play from like\""]
["02:37,720","02:42,620","\"Most of the beginning like there's a few cutscenes like for bosses and shit, but I think they're just there\""]
["02:42,620","02:45,240","\"They're like spice things up. I don't think they're there to be loading screens\""]
["02:45,240","02:49,200","\"But um Dark Souls you can pretty much run from one end of the game to the other\""]
["02:49,200","02:52,600","\"But what about\""]
["02:53,040","02:59,540","\"What about a fog nightmare fog? Oh, I guess when that's gone. Yeah, that's just there for mystery. It's not there to load\""]
["02:59,540","03:08,620","\"Whoa look at this decker decor those who prove worthy paradise awaits\""]
["03:08,620","03:11,760","\"Those who prove false\""]
["03:11,760","03:15,280","\"Why is it always got to be a fucking limerick\""]
["03:15,280","03:18,620","\"Why isn't it just like go away\""]
["03:18,620","03:20,880","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:20,880","03:25,700","\"Dude, that's perfect.\""]
["03:25,700","03:28,940","\"Can you read this?\""]
["03:28,940","03:31,440","\"I think it says, fuck off.\""]
["03:31,440","03:34,620","\"But I don't, what?\""]
["03:34,620","03:36,980","\"- They're in a movie or a game that's like this\""]
["03:36,980","03:39,300","\"and then they like find a thing and like,\""]
["03:39,300","03:41,340","\"it's in another language and then when they translate it,\""]
["03:41,340","03:43,900","\"it's like a limerick in English like perfectly.\""]
["03:43,900","03:46,100","\"I don't know.\""]

["03:56,180","03:58,580","\"it's like, you will be cast or whatever.\""]
["03:58,580","03:59,420","\"- Yeah.\""]
