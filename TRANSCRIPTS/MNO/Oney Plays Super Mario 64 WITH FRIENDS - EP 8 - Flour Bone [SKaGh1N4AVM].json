["05:11,440","05:16,840","\"Can't do that one yet. I don't have the metal cap. I think there's a way you can exploit yourself in there though\""]
["05:16,840","05:21,120","\"I think you could if you angle yourself, right? I think you can actually just swim right in\""]
["05:21,120","05:24,160","\"But I don't want\""]
["05:24,160","05:31,680","\"What was that? I was a one-up. Oh, I think Mario would be better if there was less emphasis on this\""]
["05:31,680","05:34,240","\"gentle clapping that he had\""]
["05:34,240","05:36,480","\"That\""]
["05:36,480","05:40,040","\"There was less emphasis on the star collecting and more emphasis on the\""]
["05:40,040","05:44,280","\"flag iraq the the plumbing they never\""]
["05:44,280","05:51,660","\"Some people would say that's a valid criticism because you compare this to the original Super Mario brothers\""]
["05:51,660","05:54,720","\"Where he pulled up the flag at the end of this one saying\""]
["05:54,720","05:57,800","\"He blew up buildings -\""]
["05:57,800","06:03,560","\"Listen, I was Super Mario 3. No, he did in the original. He didn't Mario world\""]
["06:04,320","06:07,120","\"I didn't mean to say original\""]
["06:07,120","06:10,640","\"But you said Mario World\""]
["06:10,640","06:13,440","\"Oh well Mario World he blows up buildings\""]
["06:13,440","06:15,840","\"And he's very happy about it\""]
["06:15,840","06:19,200","\"And then he's in blackface after he blows up the one building remember really\""]
["06:19,200","06:24,080","\"It happens in mother three remember you can\""]
["06:24,080","06:26,080","\"They crash into things and then they get old\""]
["06:26,080","06:32,080","\"But they go no you you can go in you can go in the the the hot springs and just wash off your body\""]
["06:32,080","06:33,680","\"So your face stays black remember\""]
["06:33,680","06:39,600","\"That's at the beginning of mother three. You don't remember that you never did that. I probably did\""]
["06:39,600","06:47,080","\"There he goes fucking seven years ago. Yeah, it's weird to think how long ago that actually do that\""]
["06:47,080","06:52,360","\"What I don't think I've ever done that before it's zen B while moving well weird to me that\""]
["06:52,360","06:58,120","\"Ever I always hear people that be like oh, yeah mother three looks cool too bad\""]
["06:58,120","07:00,400","\"I can't play it because it's not in English and I'm like this\""]
["07:01,240","07:05,280","\"Translation has been out for like a fucking decade. That's hard Julian\""]
["07:05,280","07:12,200","\"Even even though they're gonna play it fine. I guess I guess people are like oh ROMs are bad\""]
["07:12,200","07:16,520","\"Except you know if they're gonna play it anyways, they were gonna download a ROM\""]
["07:16,520","07:18,240","\"They were not gonna play it legitimately\""]
["07:18,240","07:20,840","\"I mean, I'm the kind of person who cares about that sort of thing\""]
["07:20,840","07:23,440","\"But even then I don't care about playing a translation of it\""]
["07:23,440","07:24,680","\"I'm fine with that translations\""]
["07:24,680","07:29,640","\"I'm fine with if I know we're never they're not gonna do that game justice even if they did translate it\""]
["07:29,640","07:31,640","\"they're gonna remove a lot of stuff from it.\""]
["07:31,640","07:35,400","\"Speaking of which, I like that you were getting a lot of responses when you were talking about\""]
["07:35,400","07:38,000","\"Super Star Saga.\""]
["07:38,000","07:41,280","\"I like that a lot of people were saying, \"\"Oh, you should just play if you don't like the\""]
["07:41,280","07:43,280","\"new one, you should just play the original.\"\"\""]
["07:43,280","07:49,760","\"And all I can think is like, \"\"Yeah, let's all play the original and not buy the new one.\"\"\""]
["07:49,760","07:51,360","\"It hadn't been fun for that.\""]
["07:51,360","07:52,600","\"Part of the charm of that game.\""]
["07:52,600","07:54,920","\"A big part of the charm was the art style on it.\""]
["07:54,920","07:58,360","\"I never got to play it, so I don't know if it's any fun, but I always did like the art style.\""]
["07:58,360","08:03,400","\"Yeah, it was really good. Yeah, it was really good music. The arts really good and humor was good to the\""]
["08:03,400","08:09,460","\"The art style itself like inspired people for a long time people were trying to emulate it because it looked so good\""]
["08:09,460","08:15,400","\"people wanted to try to capture how it looked and how designs and it were and now they're just\""]
["08:15,400","08:18,480","\"You missed their recycling assets from a\""]
["08:18,480","08:26,620","\"Was it dream team? I didn't even play that one. It looks kind of like Mario RPG the way it's kind of like it looks kind of soulless\""]
["08:26,620","08:31,260","\"I think it's based off 3D renders slightly and they're redrawing over them.\""]
["08:31,260","08:32,740","\"I forget what the last call is.\""]
["08:32,740","08:33,740","\"That actually sprites.\""]
["08:33,740","08:34,740","\"I thought it was just 3D renders.\""]
["08:34,740","08:38,660","\"No, it's sprites, but they're drawn off of 3D renders I think.\""]
["08:38,660","08:39,660","\"Others not.\""]
["08:39,660","08:41,460","\"I am always confused on people think that looks good.\""]
["08:41,460","08:46,020","\"I'm not saying Mario or Pg look soulless, it just looked creepy.\""]
["08:46,020","08:50,460","\"I mean, even as a kid, I thought Mario or Pg was pretty ugly.\""]
["08:50,460","08:53,980","\"Specifically the render or bowser where it's just a bunch of balls for a face.\""]
["08:53,980","08:56,060","\"Yeah, it didn't look very good.\""]
["08:56,060","09:00,860","\"It's a good game though. I like the original Mario PGA lot. We should play it sometime.\""]
["09:00,860","09:02,800","\"You should find pages, you know.\""]
["09:02,800","09:03,900","\"Peaches and cream.\""]
["09:03,900","09:05,220","\"She has a little dildo, Joe.\""]
["09:05,220","09:06,220","\"That's right.\""]
["09:06,220","09:15,220","\"There is a well-documented fact that Mario gets the dildo cap and he turned into it.\""]
["09:15,220","09:16,940","\"Wouldn't that be funny?\""]
["09:16,940","09:19,500","\"What if he got the weed cap and he did the weed?\""]
["09:19,500","09:21,620","\"Then it would just be Luigi.\""]
["09:21,620","09:22,620","\"He'd be green.\""]
["09:22,620","09:23,620","\"Oh my god.\""]
["09:23,620","09:25,140","\"Where's these coins I'm missing?\""]
["09:25,140","09:26,700","\"- He did.\""]
["09:26,700","09:30,620","\"I like Mario's because he can jump higher than the sky.\""]
["09:30,620","09:34,380","\"- Okay, Julian, the dog walks into a bakery.\""]
["09:34,380","09:35,220","\"- Yeah.\""]
