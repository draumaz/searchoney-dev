["08:27,260","08:29,020","\"- No, it's Mako.\""]
["08:29,020","08:30,700","\"It's like green smoke, okay?\""]

["08:37,140","08:39,140","\"Deadfisher in it.\""]
["08:39,140","08:45,260","\"So basically Julian, there's energy in the planet and this company is harnessing it and this guy is pissed off about it.\""]
["08:45,260","08:48,100","\"And then he goes inside the planet.\""]
["08:48,100","08:50,100","\"Then you commit war with him.\""]
["08:50,100","08:56,340","\"Who wouldn't love to eat a big black man? Me? Oh listen to this little satisfying sound effect.\""]
