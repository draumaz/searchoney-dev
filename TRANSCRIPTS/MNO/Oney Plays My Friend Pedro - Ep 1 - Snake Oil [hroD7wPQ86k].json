["02:02,300","02:05,840","\"If anything, you should be immune to gunfire.\""]

["02:41,160","02:47,400","\"This is rolling if you do a combat roll all the bullets miss you. That's why the first thing they teach you in basic training\""]

["02:52,400","02:57,100","\"Yeah, if you get a if you get swatted all the top all the SWAT team guys\""]

["03:12,700","03:16,400","\"No, no\""]
["03:16,940","03:24,180","\"But yeah, I have a fun gun story kind of I was in a party with my buddy Kyle like an industry thing and\""]
["03:24,180","03:31,820","\"This fucking dude came up to us and he just started he just started inviting us to go shooting with him out of nowhere\""]
["03:31,820","03:34,420","\"and I\""]
["03:34,420","03:37,300","\"Eventually left a conversation because it was it was weird\""]
["03:37,300","03:44,420","\"But Kyle got stuck in it and I was talking to somebody else and he was like is your friend still talking to that guy that you said\""]
["03:44,420","03:46,020","\"at the beginning of the conversation,\""]
["03:46,020","03:47,240","\"hey, I'm avoiding that guy\""]
["03:47,240","03:49,240","\"'cause he keeps talking about his gun.\""]
["03:49,240","03:51,600","\"And I was like, oh yeah, he's still in that conversation,\""]
["03:51,600","03:52,960","\"but I thought it was funny\""]
["03:52,960","03:55,680","\"'cause Kyle needs to learn how to stop talking to people.\""]
["03:55,680","03:57,020","\"So I just kinda left him there\""]
["03:57,020","03:59,240","\"'cause I was gonna save him eventually,\""]
["03:59,240","04:00,200","\"but he did get out of it.\""]
["04:00,200","04:01,880","\"- You wanted to teach him and to fish.\""]
["04:01,880","04:02,960","\"- Yeah, exactly.\""]
["04:02,960","04:07,520","\"But Kyle got a message from the guy\""]
["04:07,520","04:12,040","\"on I think it was LinkedIn inviting him to go shooting\""]
["04:12,040","04:14,120","\"and we were very tempted to do it.\""]
["04:14,120","04:16,880","\"We're like, if we get into this scenario,\""]
["04:16,880","04:21,280","\"we're gonna have a story that involves this weird man\""]
["04:21,280","04:25,440","\"that found Kyle on LinkedIn and a live weapon.\""]
["04:25,440","04:28,120","\"And if we live through that, it's gonna be interesting,\""]
["04:28,120","04:29,200","\"you know?\""]
["04:29,200","04:31,520","\"But we didn't do it 'cause it was like this morning\""]
["04:31,520","04:34,540","\"and he literally messaged Kyle like last night.\""]
["04:34,540","04:38,840","\"So, we missed a gun scenario with a guy.\""]
["04:38,840","04:40,800","\"But to be fair, it seemed like he was in\""]
["04:40,800","04:45,480","\"multi-level marketing because on his LinkedIn profile that explains the\""]
["04:45,480","04:52,200","\"aggressiveness and him just being a loathsome human being basically cuz on his on his LinkedIn profile\""]
["04:52,200","04:58,040","\"He basically like anytime you can't distinguish what somebody's job is or what a business does\""]
["04:58,040","05:04,040","\"It's usually like a multi-level marketing thing like anytime. It's like oh this we're the business of relations and\""]
["05:04,040","05:06,800","\"and marketing\""]
["05:06,800","05:10,560","\"So this guy's job title was like I'm the CEO and\""]
["05:10,560","05:17,840","\"CFO trainer of the business division marketing and that that was like all it said and he was like\""]
["05:17,840","05:20,480","\"Oh, yeah, we're gonna go shooting with some other CEOs\""]
["05:20,480","05:26,560","\"So I guarantee you it's like a multi-level marketing. Yeah, everybody calls themselves CEOs\""]
["05:26,560","05:29,440","\"Yes, you technically can\""]
["05:29,440","05:35,760","\"Even if it's just a one-man small business. It's just a bunch of fucking like business jargon\""]
["05:35,760","05:43,500","\"I've actually saved Kyle from some multi-level marketing shit in the past because before he started editing for for\""]
["05:43,500","05:51,080","\"Ownie plays and it's for ownie plays. Yeah, well, it's isn't he great you almost forget he's there anyway\""]
["05:51,080","05:56,600","\"though\""]
["05:56,600","06:04,080","\"Kyle was looking for jobs on like monster and and shit like that, you know the job hunting websites and\""]
["06:04,960","06:08,020","\"Yeah, he would keep going to these places that were\""]
["06:08,020","06:11,540","\"vaguely described and then um\""]
["06:11,540","06:14,360","\"They would just be fucking multi-level marketing schemes\""]
["06:14,360","06:19,480","\"But one of them like drove him to a different city and they were like, okay. What your job is\""]
["06:19,480","06:25,520","\"Is we go to people's houses and we ask if they have AT&T and\""]
["06:25,520","06:28,320","\"basically if if they just\""]
["06:28,320","06:34,800","\"Basically what they do is that if you say yes, then they call AT&T and try to put you on\""]
["06:34,800","06:40,440","\"Like their family plan basically and like shave money off the top. Yeah, this is basically all they try to do\""]
["06:40,440","06:43,200","\"That's fucking creepy\""]
["06:43,200","06:47,240","\"But yeah, basically basically they were like oh we're gonna go to our other office\""]
["06:47,240","06:51,080","\"And they just put Kyle in the back of a van and drove him to another city and we're like okay\""]
["06:51,080","06:53,080","\"This is what we're doing now\""]
["06:53,080","06:56,600","\"So he like called me and I like drove out there and rescue him\""]
["06:56,600","07:00,760","\"Then my then my fucking car blew up. How did that happen?\""]
["07:00,760","07:04,900","\"It was it was already gonna blow up, but that was like that last voyage of the car\""]
["07:04,900","07:08,440","\"It feels like you're trying to pour on a little extra guilt here of Kyle\""]
["07:08,440","07:12,480","\"He knows\""]
["07:12,480","07:15,480","\"Dude this game is awesome\""]
["07:15,480","07:21,080","\"Sorry I was talking about multi-level marketing over this it looks actually like a lot of fun\""]
["07:21,080","07:23,080","\"I I I I'm sort of\""]
["07:23,080","07:28,360","\"Into the whole MLM because I don't know I have a thing with charlatans and just like\""]
["07:28,840","07:32,140","\"fraud and fakes in general where I love hearing stories about\""]
["07:32,140","07:35,640","\"Any sort of like failure on the part of those people\""]
["07:35,640","07:40,560","\"So the fact that you rescued one person from it makes me happy\""]
["07:40,560","07:47,220","\"Yeah, do you have any good multi-level marketing fraud stories? I don't think I have any good ones of my own\""]
["07:47,220","07:50,040","\"any second hand ones\""]
["07:50,040","07:52,600","\"Yeah, but I\""]
["07:52,600","07:55,920","\"Don't know if I want to go into it. Oh, yeah\""]
["07:57,320","08:04,700","\"Because it's like at least most of the people involved in them are public figures. Okay. All right. This is not that I\""]
["08:04,700","08:09,720","\"Actually do like leaving that vague. Oh, no\""]
["08:09,720","08:15,800","\"Dude, sorry that I'm not talking to a lot. It's usually when I get into a game like this. I'm like wow\""]
["08:15,800","08:18,300","\"Yeah, Chris is on what we call the gamer's edge\""]
["08:18,300","08:25,320","\"You know what else I'll say one if if you don't mind we keep going on about multi-line marketing\""]
["08:25,840","08:30,080","\"So I'm not gonna say what the product is or who the people are\""]
["08:30,080","08:38,000","\"Also the product is fuck it. So for some reason in the voice acting industry\""]
["08:38,000","08:45,000","\"There's a bunch of people who are really into selling this one like it's basically like anti-aging cream\""]
["08:45,000","08:47,880","\"So it's you know a snake oil\""]
["08:47,880","08:55,480","\"But it turns out what it really is is it's an extract from some kind of cactus that's mildly poisonous and\""]
["08:55,480","08:58,640","\"and the reason it makes people's wrinkles disappear,\""]
["08:58,640","09:01,780","\"at least initially, is because it causes your skin to swell\""]
["09:01,780","09:03,740","\"from an allergic reaction.\""]
["09:03,740","09:06,340","\"-That's the Instagram thing, there was the poop tea\""]
["09:06,340","09:08,620","\"that makes you shit your fucking guts out.\""]
["09:08,620","09:13,020","\"It's a weight loss tea, and basically it's just a laxative.\""]
["09:13,020","09:16,620","\"I don't know why you got a lie about that.\""]
["09:16,620","09:18,780","\"I mean, isn't it compelling enough\""]
["09:18,780","09:23,740","\"just to have a big, watery shit that just evacuates your pals?\""]
["09:24,500","09:26,500","\"Isn't that enough?\""]
["09:26,500","09:28,500","\"I just sell it as a sex!\""]
["09:28,500","09:30,500","\"Sell it as a good time.\""]
["09:30,500","09:32,500","\"Sell it as a fun Tuesday night, you know?\""]
["09:32,500","09:34,500","\"But I think you still have to make it sound like unique.\""]
["09:34,500","09:36,500","\"Because otherwise people will just be like,\""]
["09:36,500","09:41,500","\"\"\"Oh, that's a good idea. I'll just buy a cheaper over the counter laxative instead of your stupid thing.\"\"\""]
["09:41,500","09:43,500","\"No, but it would be like it.\""]
["09:43,500","09:45,500","\"Okay, so like, here's the thing, right?\""]
["09:45,500","09:48,500","\"You've got attractive people on Instagram willing to show this, right?\""]
["09:48,500","09:50,500","\"I mean, like, I feel like there's a market for that.\""]
["09:50,500","09:53,500","\"Like, \"\"Oh, don't you want to imagine a lady like this?\"\"\""]
["09:53,500","09:57,980","\"Like a lady like me. Yeah, don't you want to imagine a lady like me fucking?\""]
["09:57,980","10:03,060","\"Projectile blasting shit in the back walls of my toilet like yes\""]
["10:03,060","10:07,060","\"I absolutely do I'll buy that product just to have the mental image. You know what I'm saying?\""]
["10:07,060","10:11,860","\"Look see this is this is freaking sweet lowest\""]
["10:11,860","10:14,940","\"whoa I\""]
["10:14,940","10:17,460","\"Guess I can't go in there. Oh, I can't I'm an idiot\""]
["10:17,460","10:23,100","\"Is it weird to me that hearing a family guy line without the silly voice was just funny to me\""]
["10:23,100","10:28,220","\"Because I've heard with the silly voice like so many fucking times that it\""]
["10:28,220","10:33,940","\"Wait, which family guy voice he just said he just said that's freaking sweet lowest\""]
["10:33,940","10:37,820","\"And I like genuinely laughed at it and then I realized\""]
["10:37,820","10:44,060","\"The only reason why anybody thought that that was funny in the first place is because of the Peter Griffin voice\""]
["10:44,060","10:49,580","\"But now it's gone so far around that it's funny to not have it\""]
["10:49,580","10:55,700","\"I feel very powerful right now.\""]
["10:55,700","10:57,460","\"So how do you shoot in two different directions?\""]
["10:57,460","10:58,460","\"Is that both sticks?\""]
["10:58,460","11:01,060","\"You hold them left trigger and then you'll just aim left.\""]
["11:01,060","11:02,060","\"It seems.\""]
["11:02,060","11:03,060","\"Oh, need to.\""]
["11:03,060","11:04,060","\"You didn't run with that one.\""]
["11:04,060","11:05,060","\"All right.\""]
["11:05,060","11:06,060","\"Yeah, but I'll do.\""]
["11:06,060","11:09,940","\"So basically you just have an offhand that always shoots in the same direction.\""]
["11:09,940","11:12,180","\"You make an offhand comment that makes him kill himself.\""]
["11:12,180","11:15,500","\"You make an offhand comment that becomes a viral controversy.\""]
["11:15,500","11:17,300","\"Oh, there's lots of tracking going on.\""]
["11:17,300","11:18,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:18,300","11:19,300","\"But it's fine.\""]
["11:19,300","11:20,140","\"It's fun.\""]
["11:20,140","11:22,620","\"Cool.\""]
["11:22,620","11:24,460","\"You know, that's true.\""]
["11:24,460","11:25,300","\"That is kind of cool.\""]
["11:25,300","11:26,420","\"That is pretty rataroon-y.\""]
