["03:20,520","03:25,960","\"It's just like old time. It's better than the old double jump because it doesn't slow you down\""]

["04:53,580","05:00,340","\"Okay, good idea Julian. I really like the soundtrack for this game. You would you fucking hipster? Okay fine\""]
["05:00,340","05:09,880","\"No, I like it too. Mr. Cinekle. I'm not Mr. Cinekle. I'm Mr. Cool. Look at it go. Oh, okay. That's fine. I\""]
["05:09,880","05:13,240","\"Guess I don't like to move it move it\""]

["05:32,440","05:40,200","\"Of the way you like they do they expect you to well. Yeah, cuz you were confused\""]
["05:40,200","05:48,040","\"Okay, I guess that worked.\""]
["05:48,040","05:50,200","\"This game seems foolish.\""]
["05:50,200","05:53,560","\"Well, that seems like a good way to explain it.\""]
["05:53,560","05:55,560","\"What's your favorite movie soundtrack?\""]
["05:55,560","05:57,560","\"Uh, Monkeys?\""]

["05:58,560","06:00,960","\"Get off of there.\""]
["06:00,960","06:02,760","\"Probably back to the future.\""]
["06:02,760","06:06,360","\"Do you like the Pokemon the movie 2000 soundtrack?\""]
["06:06,360","06:08,040","\"I never saw that one.\""]
["06:08,040","06:09,600","\"Weird owl did Pokemon.\""]
["06:09,600","06:10,600","\"He did.\""]
["06:10,600","06:16,280","\"And there's two songs on there dedicated to complaining about parents not understanding\""]
["06:16,280","06:17,760","\"why kids like Pokemon.\""]
["06:17,760","06:18,760","\"I forgot about that, Luke.\""]
["06:18,760","06:19,760","\"Yes.\""]
["06:19,760","06:20,760","\"Yeah, there are.\""]
["06:20,760","06:21,760","\"There really are.\""]
["06:21,760","06:22,760","\"They...\""]
["06:22,760","06:23,760","\"What were the lyrics?\""]
["06:23,760","06:28,720","\"It's how mom and dad say you're wasting time playing games, but they just don't get\""]
["06:28,720","06:29,720","\"it.\""]
["06:29,720","06:31,760","\"It's two whole songs just about it.\""]
["06:31,760","06:35,320","\"Yeah, well, what is your take on that argument?\""]
["06:35,320","06:36,760","\"Maybe kids are wasting their time.\""]
["06:36,760","06:37,760","\"No, they're learning.\""]
["06:37,760","06:39,760","\"Yeah learning how to be nerds.\""]
["06:39,760","06:41,760","\"No, they're learning how to be Pokemon Master.\""]
["06:41,760","06:44,760","\"They're gonna be together forever no matter how long.\""]
["06:44,760","06:48,760","\"These are some very meaningful relationships.\""]
["06:48,760","06:49,760","\"It's true.\""]
["06:49,760","06:51,760","\"You're having with these imaginary creatures.\""]
["06:51,760","06:54,760","\"Remember when Pikachu went to goodbye?\""]

["06:55,760","06:57,760","\"You went to goodbye?\""]
["06:57,760","06:58,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:58,760","06:59,760","\"We talked about it.\""]
["06:59,760","07:00,760","\"Remember all the people who choose the kidnapped them.\""]
["07:00,760","07:01,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:01,760","07:02,760","\"Do you remember Pikachu's vacation?\""]
["07:02,760","07:03,760","\"I don't know.\""]
["07:03,760","07:04,760","\"Do you say Pikachu?\""]
["07:04,760","07:05,760","\"No.\""]
["07:05,760","07:06,760","\"Look at these fishes.\""]
["07:06,760","07:09,260","\"-Rag going right. -Oh, they're ragdoll.\""]
["07:09,260","07:12,260","\"-I like these fish. -Fuck you.\""]

["07:14,260","07:16,260","\"-I can't tell. -Me neither.\""]
["07:16,260","07:18,760","\"-It doesn't seem like it. It seems like you should have got it.\""]
["07:18,760","07:22,260","\"-Why are all these fish flopping around? -They're having a fun time.\""]
["07:22,260","07:24,260","\"This game is goofy.\""]
["07:24,260","07:27,260","\"-That's why it's fun. -This game made me take a roofie.\""]
["07:27,260","07:30,260","\"-No one can-- -AHHH!\""]
["07:30,260","07:32,760","\"-That's what cortex did the-- -Oh, he lived.\""]

["07:36,260","07:42,060","\"gun. The roofing gun. That's called the roofie, right? How come the captain double jump, but\""]
["07:42,060","07:46,500","\"they didn't get me the run. The sprenny sprint, huh? The sprenny sprint. Do you like his run\""]
["07:46,500","07:53,820","\"cycle? It's very expressive. Like you got a belly flop. There you go. And now you write\""]
["07:53,820","08:05,460","\"that thing. Whoo. That is what he'd always say. Whoo. Does Crash Bandicoot's catchphrase.\""]
["08:05,460","08:11,220","\"Probably something back on the behind you. I feel like after twin sanity they started adding this new art style\""]
["08:11,220","08:13,500","\"It looks really weird. I don't like it\""]
["08:13,500","08:19,800","\"Well, did you see what uh which one is it there's some some of the last time the last one\""]
["08:19,800","08:25,060","\"Mind over muting some of the concept art for this looks really good and some of it looks really terrible\""]
["08:25,060","08:31,540","\"Oh, Jesus looks no, you got one right there. What are you doing?\""]
["08:31,540","08:33,540","\"I don't know.\""]

["09:31,660","09:32,660","\"Oh my god.\""]
["09:32,660","09:37,580","\"I like that it gives you the mask back every time there's a cutscene that gets triggered.\""]
["09:37,580","09:42,260","\"I love the way it gives you a big open world at the beginning to just learn all these\""]
["09:42,260","09:45,060","\"mechanics and how it's teaching them to me again.\""]
["09:45,060","09:47,420","\"That's a skunk.\""]

["09:58,540","10:01,300","\"Oh, he stuck around a little too long there.\""]
["10:01,300","10:03,500","\"Yeah, it was something he would just stay there forever.\""]
["10:03,500","10:04,500","\"It'd be too.\""]
["10:04,500","10:08,060","\"That would have made me love this game.\""]
