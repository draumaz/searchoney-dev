["06:15,080","06:18,480","\"I mean, you were looking forward to it since E3.\""]
["06:18,480","06:21,400","\"Yeah, I thought it looked cool.\""]
["06:21,400","06:22,400","\"I don't think it's bad.\""]
["06:22,400","06:24,040","\"I think it's kind of boring.\""]
["06:24,040","06:25,040","\"It's just boring.\""]
["06:25,040","06:26,280","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:26,280","06:27,960","\"It has its merits.\""]
["06:27,960","06:28,960","\"Kind of.\""]
["06:28,960","06:33,200","\"I think I have enough for Ridium now.\""]
