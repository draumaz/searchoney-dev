["00:37,880","00:39,720","\"- What you doing?\""]
["00:39,720","00:41,080","\"- My mom, my mom.\""]
["00:41,080","00:44,580","\"- I'm bastard and you fuck right off you dumb fucking.\""]
["00:44,580","00:46,220","\"- My mom gave me-- - I don't like it.\""]
["00:46,220","00:48,980","\"- Sweet grand crackers and enough for you.\""]
["00:48,980","00:50,260","\"- Let's just leave my friend.\""]

["00:54,660","00:56,840","\"(yelling)\""]
["00:56,840","00:58,840","\"She arrived on a meteor.\""]
["00:58,840","00:59,840","\"I meet you all.\""]
["00:59,840","01:00,840","\"Me?\""]
["01:00,840","01:04,840","\"Why would these kids go to this fucking door?\""]
["01:04,840","01:06,840","\"They could climb through that keyhole, it's big enough.\""]
["01:06,840","01:10,840","\"You shove his little arm in there, pick it out, and it'll be like the mummy when there's no bones.\""]
["01:10,840","01:12,840","\"Has Mickey Mouse ever been viciously gored?\""]
["01:12,840","01:15,840","\"Like in a thing, or like what do you mean?\""]
["01:15,840","01:19,840","\"Has he ever been, has he ever had his life beaten within an inch?\""]
["01:19,840","01:22,800","\"There's that scene that people like to use the gif of from\""]
["01:22,800","01:30,660","\"From the PSP game where he's like he's lifeless and lying there and he gets blown away by the wind who Mickey\""]
["01:30,660","01:32,660","\"Oh really? Yeah\""]
["01:32,660","01:35,660","\"Remember that Mickey mask game on PS1 which?\""]
["01:35,660","01:38,560","\"The 2d platformer Mickey manion\""]
["01:38,560","01:41,200","\"You're Mickey manion\""]
["01:41,200","01:43,720","\"Yeah, I think so. Is that a good game?\""]
["01:43,720","01:48,480","\"Not really it looks nice. There's not much to it\""]
["01:48,480","01:51,680","\"I remember not being able to get very far in it.\""]
["01:51,680","01:53,480","\"No, it's kind of a mess.\""]
["01:53,480","01:56,840","\"We were going to do a sequel I think.\""]
["01:56,840","01:58,480","\"They never ended up doing it.\""]
["01:58,480","02:04,000","\"It really blows my mind how all developers didn't have any rules to go on but they still\""]
["02:04,000","02:05,640","\"made like really good games.\""]
["02:05,640","02:08,920","\"You know, I'm going to say this because this has been really interesting.\""]
["02:08,920","02:12,160","\"One of the people who worked for Traveler's Tales has been uploading videos to YouTube\""]
["02:12,160","02:15,240","\"talking about what it was like programming for games.\""]
["02:15,240","02:21,320","\"He recently put up one about Sonic 3D Blast, why when you slap the cartridge it does a level select.\""]
["02:21,320","02:22,320","\"Wait, really?\""]
["02:22,320","02:24,760","\"Yeah, he said how that was... it makes sense.\""]
["02:24,760","02:29,240","\"Like, that was what I kind of assumed to begin with, but for fail-safe methods and everything,\""]
["02:29,240","02:33,240","\"because when you're submitting these things for review to like Sega,\""]
["02:33,240","02:36,840","\"and you don't want them to pick up on bugs, you create low fail-safes.\""]
["02:36,840","02:39,840","\"So the way of doing it is like, okay, there's a game crash moment.\""]
["02:39,840","02:43,640","\"We're just going to make it do something else to reset the game essentially,\""]
["02:43,640","02:45,400","\"and take you to a different screen.\""]
["02:45,400","02:46,880","\"Because that was something that, for example,\""]
["02:46,880","02:47,720","\"linked to the past, did.\""]
["02:47,720","02:48,800","\"They had the secret room.\""]
["02:48,800","02:49,720","\"Yeah, they had the--\""]
["02:49,720","02:50,240","\"And that's not the--\""]
["02:50,240","02:51,400","\"The winner kid.\""]
["02:51,400","02:54,040","\"Yeah, they actually, it was a secret room.\""]
["02:54,040","02:55,000","\"But it's not.\""]
["02:55,000","02:56,400","\"It's actually a fail safe.\""]
["02:56,400","02:58,080","\"If you bug the game out and it doesn't know\""]
["02:58,080","03:00,800","\"what room to take you in, it just puts you in that room.\""]
["03:00,800","03:01,480","\"Really?\""]
["03:01,480","03:02,440","\"So that's all that was.\""]
["03:02,440","03:05,680","\"It was just to alleviate any kind of glitches.\""]
["03:05,680","03:06,200","\"Wow.\""]
["03:06,200","03:08,360","\"And that's what they did with Sonic 3D Blast\""]
["03:08,360","03:12,640","\"is if any reason the game just crashes from anything,\""]
["03:12,640","03:16,340","\"It takes you to a screen and says, \"\"Congratulations, you unlocked the secret level select.\"\"\""]
["03:16,340","03:16,840","\"Oh.\""]
["03:16,840","03:19,840","\"It's a way to make you feel like you didn't just crash the game.\""]
["03:19,840","03:20,340","\"[chuckles]\""]
["03:20,340","03:21,340","\"That's cool.\""]
["03:21,340","03:23,840","\"But they talked about, uh...\""]
["03:23,840","03:28,240","\"Well, there's an unused 3D maze that are gonna put in the Toy Story game,\""]
["03:28,240","03:32,640","\"and they talked about how they got it to just run really smoothly, all these shortcuts they took.\""]
["03:32,640","03:36,640","\"Like, how it was only rendering the top half of the screen, and they would flip it vertically,\""]
["03:36,640","03:39,140","\"because that would save rendering time for it.\""]
["03:39,140","03:39,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:39,340","03:44,220","\"'Cause it was a really good 3D effect and it ran at a solid 60 frames per second I think.\""]
["03:44,220","03:45,220","\"Yes, this is it.\""]
["03:45,220","03:50,820","\"Uh, the channel is game-hut and it's been very interesting.\""]
["03:50,820","03:55,740","\"Actual information like the objective end, un-game design, development and everything,\""]
["03:55,740","03:56,740","\"a history.\""]
["03:56,740","03:59,140","\"It always interests me a lot and I wish there was more of it.\""]
["03:59,140","04:02,500","\"I don't know why I'm so into, uh, game-related shit.\""]
["04:02,500","04:04,940","\"I don't even like that much games.\""]
["04:04,940","04:07,460","\"I love watching game videos though.\""]
["04:07,460","04:12,280","\"It's interesting to hear like a system and hear about the craftsmanship of it back then\""]
["04:12,280","04:15,980","\"It's really interesting is everyone was trying to figure out shortcuts and everything to make stuff work\""]
["04:15,980","04:19,060","\"You don't really get that much anymore. Whoa\""]
["04:19,060","04:22,820","\"Mind how much ways you can optimize a game. Yeah\""]
["04:22,820","04:28,660","\"Weird that's why that toy story video is interesting because he talks about all the things they did to cut down render times on it\""]
["04:28,660","04:31,700","\"it's a I\""]
["04:31,700","04:36,180","\"Wouldn't have ever thought of that I would never have thought to just draw half the screen and then flip it vertically\""]
["04:36,180","04:38,180","\"I was really smart on them.\""]
["04:38,180","04:39,180","\"Wait, what?\""]
["04:39,180","04:41,180","\"That's how they made it run so well.\""]
["04:41,180","04:42,180","\"Is that...\""]
["04:42,180","04:43,180","\"It drops half the screen?\""]
["04:43,180","04:45,180","\"It's that they're stretching out.\""]
["04:45,180","04:50,180","\"They have like a grid on screen to stretch out graphics to make a 3D effect.\""]
["04:50,180","04:52,180","\"But they're not rendering all because it run too slow.\""]
["04:52,180","04:57,180","\"They're rendering only the top half and then flipping it vertically to save memory on it.\""]
["04:57,180","04:58,180","\"Oh.\""]
["04:58,180","05:01,180","\"Because of that, the sprites in the room are always...\""]
["05:01,180","05:04,180","\"'Cause they have the aliens from the movie that you're supposed to collect.\""]
["05:04,180","05:08,380","\"They're on their side because they can flip them vertically then.\""]
["05:08,380","05:12,580","\"It was a cut level in the Toy Story game that they were going to use that was a 3D maze\""]
["05:12,580","05:14,480","\"and it runs really nicely.\""]
["05:14,480","05:17,280","\"It's impressive.\""]
["05:17,280","05:24,700","\"In lever bastards, what was my mind that people can code something like a 3D program?\""]
["05:24,700","05:29,820","\"I mean, that's what Doom was doing is just ray casting to make a 3D look even though\""]
["05:29,820","05:34,540","\"it's just scanning and projecting that and making it seem as if it's 3D.\""]
["05:34,540","05:38,540","\"It's why in a lot of versions of Doom if you're doing like Z Doom or something\""]
["05:38,540","05:42,580","\"maybe try to look up and down they still limit you on how much you do it and\""]
["05:42,580","05:46,140","\"you're just seeing it really awkwardly stretch out. It's because you can't\""]
["05:46,140","05:49,780","\"really properly look up and down in it. But there's new versions of Doom where\""]
["05:49,780","05:55,140","\"they I think are just rendering through OpenGL now so it's actual true 3D. They\""]
["05:55,140","05:58,300","\"do new lighting effects and everything. You can use 3D models of Doom now because\""]
["05:58,300","05:59,300","\"Wow.\""]
["05:59,300","06:02,100","\"People go crazy with Doom.\""]
["06:02,100","06:06,340","\"I love just still looking up Doom mods.\""]
["06:06,340","06:07,380","\"Well, yeah, I do.\""]
["06:07,380","06:08,380","\"I do love Doom.\""]
["06:08,380","06:11,780","\"Oh, that's not what I meant to use.\""]
["06:11,780","06:13,980","\"I'm kind of sad that I never got in the Doom.\""]
["06:13,980","06:16,940","\"Because the first version of it I ever had was on Game Boy Advance.\""]
["06:16,940","06:18,220","\"It's like the worst port ever.\""]
["06:18,220","06:19,500","\"No, that I imagine.\""]
["06:19,500","06:19,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:19,860","06:21,980","\"We should play some Doom mods at some point.\""]
["06:21,980","06:23,100","\"They're really fun.\""]
["06:23,100","06:25,020","\"Didn't you want to play the Simpsons one?\""]
["06:25,020","06:26,620","\"Simpsons won't be really funny.\""]
["06:26,620","06:28,620","\"I\""]
["06:28,620","06:31,680","\"Know why our channels Simpsons videos get the most views\""]
["06:31,680","06:38,420","\"It's easy probably cuz six ins yeah, no no. I don't think so no no no okay\""]
["06:38,420","06:43,260","\"No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad crazy. It's because it's easy joke material\""]
["06:43,260","06:45,660","\"We haven't done a family guy game yet\""]
["06:45,660","06:52,820","\"I've noticed that since for yes to like years and years ago like all of my friends would I\""]
["06:53,260","06:57,980","\"I think it's just a thing that people do naturally because we all grew up with The Simpsons.\""]
["06:57,980","07:03,820","\"It was like just the idea of like just drawing them off model or giving them like slightly off voices\""]
["07:03,820","07:08,380","\"would always land as a joke for like everybody that I knew.\""]
["07:08,380","07:13,340","\"That's true. Yeah. I've been doing that since I was like 15 in school.\""]
["07:13,340","07:18,220","\"Yeah. It's weird to think about the fact that like at one point The Simpsons would consider like\""]
["07:18,220","07:22,060","\"Edgy and new and everybody now considers it like oh yeah it's just The Simpsons.\""]
["07:22,060","07:24,460","\"Well, we're going through cycles now.\""]
["07:24,460","07:30,060","\"Things that were once very shocking, stopped being shocking,\""]
["07:30,060","07:33,360","\"and were just openly accepted, and then became shocking again.\""]
["07:33,360","07:36,160","\"It's just a matter of time.\""]
["07:36,160","07:37,560","\"You're fighting cloud cloud.\""]
["07:37,560","07:38,060","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:38,060","07:43,460","\"Why did he put that stupid vantage on his sword?\""]
["07:43,460","07:44,860","\"'Cause it got cut. Yeah.\""]
["07:44,860","07:46,060","\"He needs it to heal up.\""]
["07:46,060","07:48,860","\"His sword was bleeding.\""]
["07:48,860","07:50,060","\"No reasoning to it.\""]
["07:50,060","07:55,580","\"Said oh my bloody heart looks cool. I put a pen my bloody heart sword got boo-boo\""]
["07:55,580","08:01,420","\"He said shut this sword and someone got a covered in blood my sword is hard\""]
["08:01,420","08:05,380","\"I mean he's that kind of guy\""]
["08:05,380","08:08,940","\"He has to be ready to the guy he cuts up with this no cloud\""]
["08:08,940","08:13,300","\"He has to be right like a pure and like a green day a mv\""]
["08:13,300","08:18,260","\"I can hate everything about it. It makes so there's so many reasons why that this doesn't work\""]
["08:18,700","08:22,860","\"This is a different cloud. This is cloud if he became evil\""]
["08:22,860","08:26,200","\"Yeah, I remember he got taken over by the darkness\""]
["08:26,200","08:32,100","\"That was a plot point in Final Fantasy 7 remember the darkness\""]
["08:32,100","08:38,780","\"He goes to bed and it says it's me cloud the darkness. You are going to become a heartless now. He said no\""]
["08:38,780","08:43,020","\"It cannot be he says\""]
["08:46,060","08:48,140","\"- Every bad, every bad, every bad.\""]

["08:54,060","08:59,640","\"- Would you be happy if like video games\""]
["08:59,640","09:01,680","\"live did that song and those were the little lyrics\""]
["09:01,680","09:02,960","\"they ended up using?\""]
["09:02,960","09:05,320","\"You have to hear an actual choir do we back?\""]
["09:05,320","09:06,920","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:06,920","09:09,600","\"- That would be pretty funny, I would enjoy that.\""]
["09:09,600","09:11,000","\"- You smell Lee.\""]
["09:11,000","09:12,680","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:12,680","09:13,920","\"- Fairly stinky.\""]
["09:15,080","09:17,080","\"He smell like pee\""]
["09:17,080","09:20,380","\"Get away from me\""]
["09:20,380","09:24,760","\"Wow is doing really well for a bit now. I'm sucking again. No\""]
["09:24,760","09:30,820","\"No, you're doing good. You just gotta use your podium. I did\""]
["09:30,820","09:35,320","\"Ripping off our toys\""]
["09:35,320","09:41,080","\"So ripping off final fantasy. He's ripping off my band-aid\""]
["09:44,280","09:50,680","\"What is he doing? He's just spitting around going around. He's trying to hit Siora. He really wants to meet Goofy and Donald. Ah shit\""]
["09:50,680","09:57,500","\"You know so uh clouds tried to play by voice actor Steve Burton\""]
["09:57,500","10:05,720","\"Did you know strife is the coolest last name you could have why is he moving in slow motion all of a sudden?\""]
["10:05,720","10:08,320","\"It's a power\""]
["10:08,320","10:11,440","\"When I first saw I had been children. I was such an autistic\""]
["10:12,000","10:20,140","\"That I said my hero is Steve Burton. I'd love to meet him someday and discuss final fantasy 7\""]
["10:20,140","10:22,700","\"Well, now's your chance Chris\""]
["10:22,700","10:26,500","\"And he'd say yeah\""]
["10:26,500","10:30,320","\"Do it on the slash when you're 14\""]
["10:30,320","10:38,040","\"And you think that's how people like work. Yes, I do remember shit like that because someone it was in something that they have to be\""]
["10:38,040","10:38,880","\"obsessed with it.\""]
["10:38,880","10:41,560","\"- Some people have some kind of like insight into it.\""]
["10:41,560","10:42,840","\"To be fair, some people are.\""]
["10:42,840","10:44,960","\"- I guarantee you whoever plays Cloud\""]
["10:44,960","10:46,400","\"probably doesn't even know what the fuck\""]
["10:46,400","10:48,280","\"he was talking about the whole time.\""]
["10:48,280","10:50,200","\"- But what's his name?\""]
["10:50,200","10:52,400","\"How am I forgetting his name is a question\""]
["10:52,400","10:54,400","\"who sells Snake's voice?\""]
