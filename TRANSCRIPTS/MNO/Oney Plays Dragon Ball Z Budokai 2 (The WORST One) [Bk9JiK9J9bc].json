["00:39,980","00:41,980","\"I don't know how to play.\""]
["00:41,980","00:45,820","\"Yeah, well, I don't think we got anywhere and I think we just gave up on it because we got Budokai 3.\""]
["00:45,820","00:49,100","\"We were like, man, this game fucking blows. One's Budokai 3 coming in.\""]
["00:49,100","00:51,260","\"So we're doing the whole dragon world.\""]
["00:51,260","00:56,540","\"Yeah, so to preface because people who don't know this game,\""]
["00:57,980","01:03,980","\"They had something good in Budokai 1 and they were like, \"\"Let's get rid of that. Let's just make a game. Let's just copy something that...\""]
["01:03,980","01:07,380","\"Let's just play and make like a sorry style board game where it's not fun at all.\""]

["01:22,980","01:24,980","\"Oh, is that...is that he you must not be named?\""]
["01:24,980","01:25,980","\"This is the animation.\""]
["01:25,980","01:27,980","\"This is what happens in go-to fights.\""]
["01:27,980","01:28,980","\"He's looking pretty good.\""]
["01:28,980","01:29,980","\"This sucks.\""]
["01:29,980","01:33,980","\"Chris, you're not even reading it as the narrator.\""]

["01:52,580","01:54,580","\"It does. It looks terrible.\""]
["01:54,580","01:55,580","\"horrible\""]

["02:26,520","02:28,980","\"You're literally playing a board game.\""]
["02:28,980","02:30,360","\"Uh, who should I be?\""]
["02:30,360","02:32,800","\"Oh, let's be Kid Trunks.\""]
["02:32,800","02:34,960","\"Accurate to the actual fucking thing.\""]
["02:34,960","02:36,960","\"Yeah, this is okay.\""]
["02:36,960","02:38,660","\"Just the way Toriyama wrote it.\""]
["02:38,660","02:41,060","\"Yeah, look, and there's-- Oh, yeah, there we go, okay.\""]

["02:51,660","02:53,660","\"It's kind of with his brain.\""]
["02:53,660","02:56,660","\"It is free, he's delicate, he says, \"\"Kato, thank you.\"\"\""]
["02:56,660","02:57,660","\"Stupid.\""]
["02:57,660","03:02,660","\"This is the exact opposite of what a little kid who wants to fight through the Dragon Ball story would want.\""]
["03:02,660","03:03,660","\"It's fucking horrible.\""]
["03:03,660","03:05,660","\"The adults are going to fight now.\""]

["03:27,000","03:28,600","\"I think those graphics are pretty good.\""]
["03:28,600","03:30,400","\"I like the way this screen looks.\""]
["03:30,400","03:32,400","\"I just like Goku's like, \"\"You can talk!\"\"\""]
["03:32,400","03:33,400","\"And then he's like pissed off.\""]
["03:33,400","03:34,400","\"He just smashes brain in.\""]

["03:50,880","03:59,880","\"Fuck you go back to your fucking mom and cry\""]
["03:59,880","04:27,880","\"I'm going to go get some visual off that, I'm going to go with it. You want to take turns, after every cyberman we kill.\""]

["05:20,120","05:22,560","\"When loading things do that\""]
["05:22,560","05:26,160","\"Didn't like it's hard to get like a patent for it, and that's why they did it was Namco\""]
["05:26,160","05:32,360","\"Oh, yeah Namco, but I don't think that is a thing anymore. Oh, I don't know these guys attacked\""]

["05:37,080","05:41,040","\"What's the new\""]
["05:41,040","05:46,920","\"It puts seven men in a coma when you knock them out they like float in the air and then come back\""]
["05:46,920","05:50,040","\"So easy oh\""]
["05:50,040","05:51,640","\"Oh, it gets fucking hard, though.\""]
["05:51,640","05:53,240","\"But just Goku fighting one Cyberman.\""]

["07:13,920","07:16,400","\"He would fucking breathe on him and his head would cave in\""]
["07:16,400","07:25,040","\"Sorry, I kind of stopped caring about Dragon Ball around trunks and go 10. I don't blame you because I\""]

["08:04,800","08:07,240","\"I know Raditz is like the big joke, but I think he's cool.\""]
["08:07,240","08:10,400","\"Yeah, no, when he shows up in the store, your mind is blown.\""]

["08:39,760","08:42,560","\"I wish there was more uh loading animations\""]
["08:42,560","08:46,320","\"It's like Raditz gets his shit knocked around so okay\""]
["08:46,320","08:51,200","\"What happens is the characters don't actually die\""]
["08:51,200","08:54,320","\"They just get their shit kicked in and you just knocked him in the go-cose\""]
["08:54,320","09:00,000","\"So now you have to fight him immediately the green bar to the left is how much help they have the worst yeah, this is bad\""]

["09:28,600","09:42,400","\"Yeah, you fucking tell them they're nailing the execution of the anime.\""]
["09:42,400","09:44,760","\"Raditz didn't even get to talk about Master Frieza.\""]
["09:44,760","09:46,600","\"He was fucking dead before then.\""]
["09:46,600","09:47,600","\"Master Frieza.\""]
["09:47,600","09:48,600","\"Yeah.\""]
