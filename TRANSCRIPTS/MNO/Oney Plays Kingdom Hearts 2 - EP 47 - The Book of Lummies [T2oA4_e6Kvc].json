["01:32,440","01:36,120","\"Let's use some kind of magical spell on their farts.\""]

["01:49,600","01:50,600","\"In real life, good...\""]
["01:50,600","01:52,600","\"That's like a bino comic thing to do.\""]

["01:54,600","01:58,600","\"You wouldn't be able to expel the gas with the force it takes in order to do that.\""]
["01:58,600","02:01,600","\"There's some way you could travel your farts into someone's house without them knowing.\""]

["02:29,800","02:38,600","\"It wouldn't think of a fart by itself. If I saw f... I don't think I'd pick up a fart. Okay, how about...\""]

["02:57,300","02:58,800","\"That's true.\""]
["02:58,800","03:01,440","\"That's because people gotta coin their own sound effects.\""]
["03:01,440","03:04,520","\"I'd rather do that than do fairly odd parents like, \"\"Oh, noun.\"\"\""]
["03:04,520","03:07,400","\"Like the thing that you turned into it says that.\""]
["03:07,400","03:08,400","\"That's funny.\""]
["03:08,400","03:09,120","\"That's the point.\""]
["03:09,120","03:13,000","\"That makes me mad. I don't like it. It gets that was the joke you fucking loser\""]
["03:13,000","03:19,240","\"The thing is you can only make that joke a couple of times at most after that then it just makes you look lazy\""]
["03:19,240","03:21,240","\"It's twodition\""]
["03:21,240","03:28,760","\"Twodition you can fall back after you do it then you make it say joke and then I think you've exhausted everything at that point\""]
["03:28,760","03:34,800","\"I like this song. It's very peaceful. Yeah, this is a peaceful little\""]
["03:35,680","03:40,760","\"9/11 song if you're taking of 7/11 that's the convenience store I\""]
["03:40,760","03:44,240","\"Confused that would get that would suit a 7/11 store\""]
["03:44,240","03:54,720","\"Little 7/11 man running around the counter. Yeah, he's dropping hot dogs everywhere\""]
["03:54,720","04:00,640","\"Bouncing it you would suit you have to quick time react them back into the oven. Oh, yeah, he swings his keep late\""]
["04:02,320","04:06,280","\"Okay, I'm just looking around to see if there's any chests that I missed it is one time\""]
["04:06,280","04:10,000","\"I walked in the 7-11 and there was no one there and I walked in I\""]
["04:10,000","04:16,220","\"Opened the slidey door and I could see the little man cutting open one of the hot dogs with his switchblade\""]
["04:16,220","04:21,640","\"I mean he talked a little luge into it and close it up back up. He's so to back up. I look back at you\""]
["04:21,640","04:26,700","\"He looked back at me. He smiled and his brown teeth glistened in the moonlight\""]

["04:28,700","04:30,700","\"You went half off another time, but half off mine.\""]
["04:30,700","04:31,700","\"You went half off mine.\""]
["04:31,700","04:32,700","\"Yeah, but they were you.\""]
["04:32,700","04:33,700","\"He was literally just going out,\""]
["04:33,700","04:35,700","\"but he was like, \"\"I believe we don't want to be here.\"\"\""]
["04:35,700","04:39,700","\"I was like, \"\"Jibberish scares me.\"\"\""]
["04:39,700","04:44,700","\"And that's why I would be really nervous if somebody looked at me dead in the eye and they were like,\""]

["04:45,700","04:47,700","\"That was the hot dog grill out, and then he turns them all over.\""]
["04:47,700","04:49,700","\"That's why I had the stitches on them.\""]

["04:51,700","04:53,700","\"I just blame that guy, 'cause it's crazy.\""]
["04:53,700","04:55,700","\"Wait, that actually happened if it was a joke?\""]
["04:55,700","05:02,340","\"Was a joke oh, but uh my sister speaks gibberish in her sleep, and it's the scariest thing. Oh, yeah\""]
["05:02,340","05:08,260","\"No, oh I forget I it's been so long, but she used to go like have it a\""]

["05:39,500","05:41,500","\"We got some problems with the film.\""]

["05:47,500","05:48,500","\"Oh, he's so endearing.\""]

["06:14,300","06:15,140","\"I don't think they do.\""]
["06:15,140","06:16,980","\"The only thing I would ever get it for was the comics\""]
["06:16,980","06:18,300","\"and even then I would get one\""]
["06:18,300","06:19,300","\"and I would be disappointed\""]
["06:19,300","06:20,660","\"'cause it wasn't the comics I liked.\""]
["06:20,660","06:22,140","\"They had nightmare Ned comics.\""]

["06:22,960","06:24,300","\"- That is cool.\""]
["06:24,300","06:27,780","\"- And there was, I remember this because I remember\""]
["06:27,780","06:30,260","\"as a kid, like I had a friend who was really scared of it\""]
["06:30,260","06:31,620","\"and he didn't want that-- - Not that man Ned.\""]
["06:31,620","06:33,540","\"- Yeah, he didn't want that issue of it open.\""]
["06:33,540","06:35,780","\"And it was like-- - I feel bad for the kid\""]
["06:35,780","06:36,700","\"who's that scared.\""]
["06:36,700","06:38,940","\"- Yeah, it was a comic about him like being dressed\""]
["06:38,940","06:41,500","\"as a spork for Halloween and he didn't wanna be one\""]
["06:41,500","06:43,260","\"'cause he thought that was a really lame costume.\""]
["06:43,260","06:45,460","\"And then he had a nightmare about other kids dressed\""]
["06:45,460","06:48,020","\"as sporks being tortured and murdered.\""]
["06:48,020","06:49,420","\"And that scared my friend a lot.\""]
["06:49,420","06:50,300","\"He didn't like that.\""]
["06:50,300","06:51,380","\"I can see why.\""]
["06:51,380","06:53,460","\"- I'm pretty sure when I was younger, I bought some,\""]
["06:53,460","06:56,300","\"I think it was a Looney Tunes comic or something.\""]
["06:56,300","06:57,140","\"- Uh huh.\""]
["06:57,140","06:59,120","\"- And it came with this, it was a Halloween edition\""]
["06:59,120","07:02,820","\"and it came with this toy of like a scary statue head\""]
["07:02,820","07:04,660","\"that had nothing to do with Looney Tunes.\""]
["07:04,660","07:06,980","\"And it was like the scariest thing I've ever seen.\""]
["07:06,980","07:10,140","\"It was like genuinely terrifying to look at.\""]
["07:10,140","07:10,980","\"- Was that what it looked like?\""]
["07:10,980","07:11,820","\"Was that lady?\""]
["07:11,820","07:13,340","\"- No, it was like a,\""]

["07:17,660","07:19,980","\"black eyed like rotting corpse head.\""]
["07:19,980","07:21,460","\"and I don't know why.\""]
["07:21,460","07:24,460","\"- You know what, when I was growing up\""]
["07:24,460","07:28,180","\"because we were living in like a really old house,\""]
["07:28,180","07:29,900","\"the basement was kind of scary\""]
["07:29,900","07:31,180","\"because there was a bathroom down there\""]
["07:31,180","07:33,260","\"that was just a hole in the ground.\""]
["07:33,260","07:36,340","\"And the worst part was that there was like this metal\""]
["07:36,340","07:40,220","\"crafted like portrait of a guy's face on the wall down there\""]
["07:40,220","07:41,980","\"in the little bathroom. - That's scary.\""]
["07:41,980","07:44,140","\"- And it was all rusty like metal.\""]
["07:44,140","07:46,220","\"So it's like dripping and everything.\""]
["07:46,220","07:47,540","\"And it looks really bizarre.\""]
["07:47,540","07:49,140","\"And I don't know why it was still hung up\""]
["07:49,140","07:51,540","\"because everything else that was down there was gone.\""]
["07:51,540","07:52,680","\"But that was still down there,\""]
["07:52,680","07:54,660","\"and I remember that was like a weird thing for us\""]
["07:54,660","07:56,940","\"that we didn't want ever go down there to look at it.\""]
["07:56,940","07:59,760","\"- That's scary. - It was scary, all right.\""]
["07:59,760","08:01,020","\"Why are you a card?\""]
["08:01,020","08:02,780","\"- 'Cause he plays a game and he lost.\""]
