["10:42,780","10:46,740","\"He just poorly animates over the wall and falls and she got really mad at that\""]
["10:46,740","10:52,740","\"So I'd be afraid to show her something like Grand Theft Auto where they ragged all over the car and blood comes up\""]
["10:52,740","10:54,500","\"Yeah\""]
["10:54,500","10:57,740","\"So like did she not like watch oni plays or anything ever?\""]
