["23:34,420","23:38,660","\"good idea. I think we've been literally in here for two hours. We've been in here for two hours\""]
["23:38,660","23:43,940","\"because the PS3 is a piece of shit. Yeah. And what happened was we couldn't add a PayPal account\""]
["23:43,940","23:48,420","\"without verifying for whatever reason. I already took an hour to get into that to begin with.\""]
["23:48,420","23:54,020","\"But also we had to find the decryptor because for whatever reason, Sony decided to encrypt the\""]
["23:54,020","24:00,500","\"HDMI and PS3. But the reason we're also playing it on here is because the disk we have is scratched\""]
["24:00,500","24:05,140","\"And also it's better quality footage on here anyways, but uh,\""]
