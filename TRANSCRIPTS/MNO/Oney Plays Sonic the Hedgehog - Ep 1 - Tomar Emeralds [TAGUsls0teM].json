["11:09,200","11:14,060","\"It's very like stupid shit like that those those two have accepted meanings\""]
["11:14,060","11:19,220","\"No, I don't think anybody really uses them correct, but no one ever explains like you have to figure it out\""]

["11:51,660","11:55,940","\"It's still the question is if you learn a word\""]
