["06:07,440","06:23,440","\"theCynicalWeeb is that the through line of Dark Souls to Bloodborne is that they both include some plots about people being turned into sea creatures\""]
["06:23,440","06:27,680","\"Yeah, I was in Dark Souls 1 2 1 2 1 2 3\""]
["06:27,680","06:32,700","\"How come 1 2 3 sounds like ABC\""]
["06:32,700","06:37,220","\"Has ever happened that they gave a game a title, but they printed the box wrong\""]
["06:37,220","06:40,960","\"So there's a typo in the box and everyone thought that was the name of it. That's probably happened\""]
["06:40,960","06:43,920","\"So instead of Dark Souls 2, it's Dark Souls 1 2\""]
["06:43,920","06:48,380","\"Did you mon room the initial Dark Souls 2 look like Dark Souls\""]
["06:49,120","06:52,880","\"That line cuts across a letter it did look like that\""]

["08:23,200","08:25,760","\"Why is every single character in this game in the asshole?\""]
["08:25,760","08:26,760","\"It's true.\""]
["08:26,760","08:30,200","\"'Cause it makes you feel alone and isolated.\""]
