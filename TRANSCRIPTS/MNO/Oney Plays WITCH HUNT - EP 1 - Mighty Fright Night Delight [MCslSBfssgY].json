["00:11,000","00:14,000","\"This is witch hunt. It is a new scary game.\""]
["00:14,000","00:16,000","\"Are you freaking ready, Zach?\""]
["00:16,000","00:18,000","\"Oh, I'm pretty good ready.\""]
["00:18,000","00:21,000","\"This is a game that I have played for maybe four minutes.\""]
["00:21,000","00:23,000","\"And I liked what I saw.\""]
["00:23,000","00:24,000","\"Let's see what we've got.\""]
["00:24,000","00:26,000","\"Not what we've got by new game.\""]
["00:26,000","00:27,000","\"Yes.\""]
["00:27,000","00:28,000","\"Certainly.\""]
["00:28,000","00:29,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:29,000","00:30,000","\"Read it.\""]
["00:30,000","00:36,040","\"When demo and slaughtered my family, I decided to devote my life to a fake evil.\""]
["00:36,040","00:41,160","\"At first I was motivated by a vengeance, but then I met a man who was a man who was a man\""]
["00:41,160","00:42,160","\"who I went.\""]
["00:42,160","00:46,560","\"Recently I heard in a small town called Belleville people started to disappear and get killed\""]
["00:46,560","00:47,560","\"by some creature.\""]
["00:47,560","00:48,560","\"Uh oh.\""]
["00:48,560","00:49,880","\"That's not good.\""]
["00:49,880","00:52,840","\"I immediately went to that town.\""]
["00:52,840","00:53,840","\"Bad idea.\""]
["00:53,840","00:56,160","\"That's a bad idea, but you know what?\""]
["00:56,160","00:58,680","\"It makes for an interesting concept, so we'll keep going.\""]
["00:58,680","01:02,240","\"Something big attacked me on my way to Belleville.\""]
["01:02,240","01:07,880","\"I was able to scare it off, but my horse ran away with most of my supplies.\""]
["01:07,880","01:11,520","\"Luckily, I was able to get to town on foot shit.\""]
["01:11,520","01:14,320","\"Shit man, this is me.\""]
["01:14,320","01:15,320","\"This is me.\""]
["01:15,320","01:18,520","\"So the story is he's on his way to kiss a creature to a town.\""]
["01:18,520","01:20,080","\"Yeah, so he's heard word.\""]
["01:20,080","01:21,480","\"There's a spooky creature.\""]
["01:21,480","01:24,400","\"Hey, I think I have what you need.\""]
["01:24,400","01:27,760","\"So this guy lets you trade shit.\""]
["01:27,760","01:29,960","\"Right now we've got 50 coins.\""]
["01:29,960","01:33,960","\"And let's see, what do you, let's see what we got here.\""]
["01:33,960","01:34,960","\"Free.\""]
["01:34,960","01:36,120","\"What do you, we can get for free there?\""]
["01:36,120","01:37,560","\"The thunder totem.\""]
["01:37,560","01:38,560","\"That's pretty cool.\""]
["01:38,560","01:39,560","\"What's up, free's good.\""]
["01:39,560","01:43,040","\"Okay, so yeah, in this game you're hunting down the thing, you're kind of like a Van\""]
["01:43,040","01:44,800","\"Hell Singish kind of a guy.\""]
["01:44,800","01:45,800","\"I see.\""]
["01:45,800","01:47,600","\"So you might be, you're a creature hunter.\""]
["01:47,600","01:49,680","\"Yeah, you're a go creature hunter, yes.\""]
["01:49,680","01:51,960","\"I like these little icons, they're interesting.\""]
["01:51,960","01:53,640","\"I'll no longer receive fault.\""]
["01:53,640","01:57,840","\"Get that one - oh, we'll eat fuck. Okay, that was a bonk now\""]
["01:57,840","02:04,160","\"Do you know how to get coins? Yeah? Okay, so what we got to do is we got to go out in the world and hunt for treasure\""]
["02:04,160","02:09,480","\"Check this out. Oh my god. You read so fast. Can you kill that thing?\""]
["02:09,480","02:11,280","\"That thing?\""]
["02:11,280","02:18,140","\"Can you kill that monster fucking beast a creature? No, you just have to open your inventory. This is my inventory\""]
["02:18,140","02:21,960","\"These are my skills. They stay on me once I have them forever, which is kind of cool\""]
["02:21,960","02:27,380","\"So you can't lose them mm-hmm. They don't fall off you like sonic rings. We get hit where you prayed a church\""]
["02:27,380","02:33,620","\"That's uncle church. You're probably looking for a lot of weight. No probably looking\""]
["02:33,620","02:36,100","\"He got killed by that horrible beast\""]
["02:36,100","02:41,020","\"Okay, this guy's head is to be first fucking body provide medical help if you need it\""]
["02:41,020","02:44,780","\"Yeah, give me that I've only got 85 health\""]
["02:44,780","02:50,900","\"See you are yours. Are you injured, right? Yeah now? I'm a hundred. I'm good. I'm good, baby\""]
["02:51,260","02:56,600","\"So anyway, this town needs our help. That's the whole plot. We need to go find the beast\""]
["02:56,600","03:01,980","\"Now so it's sort of open world for lack of a better turn with the sense of there's no real\""]
["03:01,980","03:03,940","\"Does it mean does it tell you a way to go?\""]
["03:03,940","03:07,840","\"Do you just kind of explore yourself and figure out what you well first? We're gonna go here. This is the\""]
["03:07,840","03:10,340","\"Where the mayor leave okay?\""]
["03:10,340","03:19,860","\"As the mayor of Belleville I can guarantee that if you'll really be able to help our town\""]
["03:20,180","03:24,800","\"Your doings will be greatly rewarded and you'll have our eternal gratitude\""]
["03:24,800","03:29,940","\"To get to the woods go across the bridge there careful\""]
["03:29,940","03:33,240","\"People have seen some undead creatures in those woods\""]
["03:33,240","03:38,060","\"So we are dealing with something much more sinister than just a wild beast\""]
["03:38,060","03:41,380","\"Good luck and God bless you\""]
["03:41,380","03:47,120","\"Okay, so that's what I like about this game. Uh, there's not too much places to go, but if you\""]
["03:48,220","03:50,700","\"That just you would oh my god\""]
["03:50,700","03:56,940","\"Are you scared I thought I saw somebody walk past the door\""]
["03:56,940","04:01,100","\"No, genuinely no genuinely genuinely\""]
["04:01,100","04:04,060","\"This game. I'm not even that's my cat. I'm not even\""]
["04:04,060","04:10,340","\"Look it looks what's feet. I thought it was Nile for a second. Why can't I swear that scared me you right now?\""]
["04:10,340","04:17,660","\"You've actually scared me so now we're we're probably playing this game with a man in the house a fucking man stalking the halls\""]
["04:17,660","04:22,940","\"Yeah, so anyway that that's that's as much as the intro you're gonna get it gets you it puts you right in\""]
["04:22,940","04:25,820","\"It's a luxury says go across the bridge right? Yeah\""]
["04:25,820","04:31,840","\"And now I'm gonna hand the game over to you okay, and I want you to play and have fun push E to go to the woods\""]
["04:31,840","04:33,840","\"Oh, oh, I literally can't do it\""]
["04:33,840","04:41,760","\"When a powerful monster is nearby my heart starts beating and consumes mana the closer I am to the monster the faster\""]
["04:41,760","04:45,660","\"My heart beats so it's best to start running to identify the direction of the monster\""]
["04:46,500","04:50,580","\"People say that I possess this ability because the blood of an angel runs through my veins\""]
["04:50,580","04:53,920","\"So it basically works like Slenderman, right?\""]
["04:53,920","05:01,060","\"Well, it's like it the closer he gets you you get static. It's the same kind of thing. Uh, actually I'm not sure\""]
["05:01,060","05:05,300","\"I so you haven't even gotten this far. Have you I've never actually come across the beast\""]
["05:05,300","05:08,860","\"That's your fucking horse\""]
["05:08,860","05:15,900","\"Kazoo can I oh I can't I can't I can't I can't expect oh no Bella. I really hoped you'd manage to run away\""]
["05:15,900","05:16,900","\"Oh no.\""]
["05:16,900","05:18,900","\"Pick that shit up.\""]
["05:18,900","05:20,460","\"What is that?\""]
["05:20,460","05:21,460","\"Silver bullets.\""]
["05:21,460","05:23,460","\"How do I fucking shoot my gun?\""]
["05:23,460","05:26,300","\"Okay so you're going to run into little monsters.\""]
["05:26,300","05:27,900","\"Oh there's a guy over there.\""]
["05:27,900","05:29,900","\"There's a little man over there.\""]
["05:29,900","05:31,740","\"Switching weapons is fast and reloading.\""]
["05:31,740","05:35,460","\"So right if you take a shot and you miss, it's going to take you a long time to reload\""]
["05:35,460","05:36,460","\"it.\""]
["05:36,460","05:37,460","\"And you right click the aim.\""]
["05:37,460","05:38,460","\"Okay.\""]
["05:38,460","05:39,460","\"So in this game.\""]
["05:39,460","05:40,460","\"My vision is so bad.\""]
["05:40,460","05:41,460","\"I'm going to try to...\""]
["05:41,460","05:42,460","\"No it's not.\""]
["05:42,460","05:43,460","\"He's small on the screen.\""]
["05:43,460","05:44,460","\"I'm going to charge him.\""]
["05:44,460","05:45,460","\"Really?\""]
["05:45,460","05:47,720","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:47,720","05:49,120","\"Don't do it.\""]
["05:49,120","05:51,540","\"(gunshot)\""]
["05:51,540","05:52,380","\"- You got him.\""]
["05:52,380","05:53,220","\"- Did I get him?\""]
["05:53,220","05:54,040","\"- You got that guy.\""]
["05:54,040","05:55,700","\"And then you walk over him.\""]
["05:55,700","05:57,660","\"And that blue stuff is mana.\""]
["05:57,660","05:58,980","\"- Did I just, can I get any of your problems\""]
["05:58,980","05:59,980","\"that just did it, got it from him?\""]
["05:59,980","06:01,020","\"- I think you got it, yeah.\""]
["06:01,020","06:02,100","\"You just gotta make sure you can.\""]
["06:02,100","06:04,060","\"- Whoa, what the fuck was that?\""]
["06:04,060","06:05,580","\"- That's a, you're writing shit down.\""]
["06:05,580","06:06,660","\"- That was so much of my fucking brain.\""]
["06:06,660","06:08,500","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:08,500","06:09,340","\"- What was this?\""]
["06:09,340","06:11,300","\"- We're playing this with headphones turned up full blast.\""]
["06:11,300","06:12,140","\"- Yeah, yeah.\""]
["06:12,140","06:12,980","\"- Super spooky effect.\""]
["06:12,980","06:13,980","\"- That sounded like it was next to me, okay.\""]
["06:13,980","06:15,060","\"- Okay, Zach.\""]
["06:15,060","06:21,380","\"This is the thing it's a literal fork that a little it's a fork in the road the thing the cool thing about this game is what you're hunting\""]
["06:21,380","06:23,100","\"It's on a big world map, right?\""]
["06:23,100","06:26,280","\"So it's just wandering so you might just run into it no matter where you go\""]
["06:26,280","06:30,280","\"So you just walk around and now can I see the map at all is really good that button\""]
["06:30,280","06:32,220","\"I don't think you have a map yet push M\""]
["06:32,220","06:38,380","\"I thought okay never mind oh\""]
["06:38,380","06:42,580","\"What oh\""]
["06:44,620","06:49,620","\"Lord I don't like this. I'll get the fuck out. I've got your right toys right now. I don't know it's possible\""]
["06:49,620","06:52,500","\"That's not like a tree bridge right\""]
["06:52,500","06:56,300","\"You thought you heard a tree break and that's what I thought I heard\""]
["06:56,300","06:59,980","\"What do you think of the atmosphere?\""]
["06:59,980","07:07,180","\"Like how it's not even like dark dark, but it's like dark enough. It's gloomy. It's gloomy. It's a little it's twilighty\""]
["07:07,180","07:12,460","\"I love gloomy shit. I love also. I'm a huge fan of like wooded areas in video games\""]
["07:13,740","07:16,700","\"Sorry if this is whoa, that's a stinky little man\""]
["07:16,700","07:19,740","\"Is it there?\""]
["07:19,740","07:26,700","\"I apologize people if I if I'm not doing submit this right, I'm just gonna try to do fine\""]
["07:26,700","07:29,680","\"We just started so you get the handle here\""]
["07:29,680","07:32,380","\"You'll be okay\""]
["07:32,380","07:38,220","\"Just keep going just keep going we gotta find it. I'm gonna run full speed of full speed ahead\""]
["07:38,220","07:42,780","\"So I'm assuming because this game is called witch hunt you're hunting down a witch\""]
["07:42,980","07:49,900","\"Yeah, I think now you let just say that because you played this and you know you know, oh, oh fuck what's happening?\""]
["07:49,900","07:52,460","\"Whoa, where is it? I don't know\""]
["07:52,460","07:57,700","\"All right, I don't actually know what's happening there. I think that was it\""]
["07:57,700","08:00,940","\"I think that was being close to something really yeah, I think so oh\""]
["08:00,940","08:08,260","\"Do you see anything? Oh, oh fuck. Oh, I guess you're not supposed to look in the direction of it or something\""]
["08:08,260","08:10,260","\"Yeah, don't look that way. I'm guessing\""]
["08:10,260","08:12,780","\"so it must be\""]
["08:12,780","08:20,780","\"I guess you were in its line of sight. I'm not sure. Oh, I think it's up there. These straight head\""]
["08:20,780","08:27,020","\"That's a dog\""]
["08:27,020","08:37,460","\"Kidding me I forgot the reload you need a real low until you die in the switch. Okay sure that's stonk. Don't worry\""]
["08:37,460","08:40,400","\"That's how it goes. That's what I wanted\""]
["08:40,400","08:43,400","\"I think I got a fairly good idea of it though.\""]
["08:43,400","08:47,400","\"I wanted the experience where you go in and blind because it's this kind of a game.\""]
["08:47,400","08:51,400","\"This isn't a story driven game. You're literally supposed to just go in and explore.\""]
["08:51,400","08:55,400","\"This game would be really interesting if you think it'd be fucking horrifying if you were...\""]
["08:55,400","08:57,400","\"Five good pair of headphones.\""]
["08:57,400","08:59,400","\"You gotta reload like that.\""]
["08:59,400","09:00,400","\"Nah, nah, nah, nah.\""]
["09:00,400","09:03,400","\"It's honestly a really great way to kind of give suspense in a way.\""]
["09:03,400","09:04,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:04,400","09:05,400","\"In a natural way.\""]
["09:05,400","09:06,400","\"I'm running down the window.\""]
["09:06,400","09:07,400","\"So I think we're right.\""]
["09:07,400","09:11,500","\"I think from what I understand that that is like the stupid static thing\""]
["09:11,500","09:15,720","\"I think so I think you're not supposed to look in the direction of it and I may be wrong\""]
["09:15,720","09:17,720","\"I'm not sure but I think\""]
["09:17,720","09:21,340","\"That was that the question is this is that dog gonna be the same spotters at all random eyes\""]
["09:21,340","09:26,440","\"I think it's randomized and I think because we're some kind of van hell's go left\""]
["09:26,440","09:30,480","\"It's you've got that area. I was at earlier and see if you look at the area see if you get a similar a\""]
["09:30,480","09:33,240","\"little red\""]
["09:33,240","09:35,400","\"Deal\""]
["09:35,400","09:39,540","\"Yeah, I look I was up here. I looked to the right beyond this rock and I got the little red thing\""]
["09:39,540","09:42,320","\"Oh\""]
["09:42,320","09:44,320","\"What's that?\""]
["09:44,320","09:46,640","\"Something is probably in this area\""]
["09:46,640","09:51,640","\"What the fuck was that?\""]
["09:51,640","09:56,720","\"Did that say die? Yeah, I whispered something. I don't know if it's a guy, but it was something. I\""]
["09:56,720","09:59,400","\"I am not good at horror games. I\""]
["09:59,400","10:01,880","\"Don't I think I just heard the grudge\""]
["10:02,400","10:04,400","\"Well, oh my god\""]
["10:04,400","10:07,220","\"That's what I like about this though. There's a lot of cool sounds\""]
["10:07,220","10:12,920","\"No, I think good I say before I think good sound designers one of most important things in any piece of media\""]
["10:12,920","10:15,240","\"Yeah, cuz it puts your brain in the right mood\""]
["10:15,240","10:18,040","\"so\""]
["10:18,040","10:20,040","\"Where the fuck are we?\""]
["10:20,040","10:23,840","\"What the fuck is okay?\""]
["10:23,840","10:27,320","\"So what what does that mean?\""]
["10:27,320","10:29,920","\"Whoa, where is it?\""]
["10:29,920","10:33,940","\"Where look at your little thing down there. I think you might be running towards it right now. Maybe not\""]
["10:33,940","10:39,700","\"Aren't you supposed to head in the direction of it? Oh, I think maybe you I I got what's it doing?\""]
["10:39,700","10:42,420","\"Are we going the right way?\""]
["10:42,420","10:45,420","\"I've never actually ran into it. Oh\""]
["10:45,420","10:47,260","\"My god\""]
["10:47,260","10:52,140","\"Now here's my quest to be guys skipped over to forgot it, but what that thing goes down to you lose health\""]
["10:52,140","10:56,300","\"I think that's just my magic. It's like sappin my little magic my little magic sprites\""]
["10:56,620","11:00,240","\"How does that replenish just by killing something I think so yeah oh\""]
["11:00,240","11:06,140","\"So I see see if it's said to kill little things so that way you have an idea of where it is I guess so yeah\""]
