["02:19,240","02:24,040","\"I think Austin Powers' Gold Member is one of the funniest films.\""]
["02:24,040","02:27,480","\"I really the watch them all again. I love that movie\""]
["02:27,480","02:32,720","\"The first the first Austin powers they cut out a bunch of stuff for the American version really yeah\""]
["02:32,720","02:38,160","\"I think Austin powers one is I think one and two aren't that great and two people regarded some kind of masterpiece\""]
["02:38,160","02:42,600","\"But it's really not that funny. It has some funny parts and he's better than one two is better than one\""]
["02:42,600","02:44,760","\"But one's not even one's boring\""]
["02:44,760","02:49,200","\"It's pretty tame from what I recall. It's pretty just like normal. It's like not even yeah\""]
["02:49,200","02:54,020","\"I don't find that that's why I said there's a lot apparently that was cut out of the American\""]
["02:54,020","02:59,020","\"version of Austin Powers 1.\""]
["02:59,020","03:02,020","\"Wait, so Austin Powers 1 wasn't an American film?\""]
["03:02,020","03:07,500","\"I don't know if it was or wasn't, but I know that the American release of it, they cut\""]
["03:07,500","03:09,500","\"out a bunch of stuff.\""]
["03:09,500","03:15,300","\"Or they added stuff for the other release, think of it that way.\""]
["03:15,300","03:16,300","\"Is this Dark Souls now?\""]
["03:16,300","03:19,340","\"Yeah, that's the fucking Sun guy.\""]
["03:19,340","03:20,340","\"That's so rare.\""]
["03:20,340","03:21,340","\"Yeah.\""]

["03:32,780","03:39,780","\"If you were in love with a woman and she took all of her shit materialized it in a big rock ball\""]
["03:39,780","03:44,700","\"I think levitating rock ball all of her feces. Yeah, she just hurled it into the yard\""]
["03:45,980","03:50,520","\"I feel like you could sell rock like that. Yeah, would you ever\""]
["03:50,520","03:53,580","\"Morning steamer is it look like that?\""]
["03:53,580","03:56,020","\"Well, would you rather have a\""]
["03:56,020","03:59,100","\"Buffalo take a diarrhea\""]
["03:59,100","04:01,500","\"Like Chris a lot would you rather have?\""]
["04:01,500","04:06,460","\"Beetle strength or scout and how big is the beetle if it's a regular?\""]
["04:06,460","04:11,780","\"You know you're you but you have the strength of a beetle if the beetle was my side I would have no strength\""]
["04:11,780","04:14,380","\"No, you know you're not you know the strength of a small beetle\""]
["04:14,380","04:16,500","\"But you have if the beetle was the size of you\""]
["04:16,500","04:22,540","\"Yes, basically okay, but beetle strike they say it's beetle strike, but you know what that means\""]
["04:22,540","04:26,380","\"So what about that? Whatever their happy or or\""]
["04:26,380","04:29,300","\"Fly at the abilities\""]
["04:29,300","04:32,320","\"Flying and abilities so I could fly\""]
["04:32,320","04:35,400","\"Yeah, but you look like an air when you fly\""]
["04:39,460","04:41,460","\"That would be the most scary thing.\""]
["04:41,460","04:45,460","\"You could shot with a fucking sky by like, by jets, by little fighter jets.\""]
["04:45,460","04:47,460","\"If I saw a 6'4\"\" flying through the sky.\""]
["04:47,460","04:49,460","\"But you would never need the super strength.\""]
["04:49,460","04:55,460","\"If anybody ever tried to fuck with you, you could just start flying as a giant ant and they'd freak the fuck out.\""]
["04:55,460","04:59,460","\"But I'd tell you little jets of black helicopters would fucking cheat you up the earth.\""]
["04:59,460","05:04,460","\"To answer, I would rather have ant abilities because I would just fly when no one could see me at night time.\""]
["05:04,460","05:08,460","\"You're still like 6'2 though, you're still gigantic flying in.\""]
["05:08,460","05:12,380","\"Yeah, it's fucking loud. Can you also\""]
["05:12,380","05:14,460","\"Can you also drink and talk as an aunt?\""]
["05:14,460","05:17,460","\"No, dogs bark at you.\""]
["05:17,460","05:20,460","\"They see a giant six or two buddy.\""]
["05:20,460","05:22,460","\"Can they do the final fantasy seven dog bar for girls?\""]
["05:22,460","05:26,460","\"That's exactly sounds exactly like that, but only when you're flying in.\""]
["05:26,460","05:29,460","\"I would rather be an aunt.\""]
["05:29,460","05:32,460","\"I would rather have be able to fly as a big aunt.\""]
["05:32,460","05:37,460","\"What would you do if the Machiavellian twist was a big aunt?\""]
["05:37,460","05:44,100","\"Was that uh wait a second when you said this is not fair when you turned into the and you also got the brain of an ant\""]
["05:44,100","05:47,460","\"You were just reduced to be an ant forever then that would suck ass\""]
["05:47,460","05:50,500","\"Also, Lyle, I was gonna say to Zack\""]
["05:50,500","05:54,340","\"It's not fair that I have to look like an ant while while while I have beetle strength\""]
["05:54,340","05:56,940","\"I don't have to look like a giant beetle. Yeah, that's that's the trade-up\""]
["05:56,940","06:01,060","\"But you could you get the fly really could fly in well, let me look like a beetle to them though\""]
["06:01,060","06:05,060","\"You can't look like a beautiful look out. Okay, five you have beetle feet. Oh god. That's scary\""]
["06:05,060","06:10,340","\"I don't know that jump down. Yeah, okay, okay. Okay. What about this? You don't look like a beetle, but\""]
["06:10,340","06:14,380","\"You sound like one you sell like a beetle like if you would\""]
["06:14,380","06:23,140","\"Yeah, so you have you have one black spot on your leg that looks like a beetle skin that's stupid\""]
["06:23,140","06:28,440","\"It feels drag that's stupid, but but but but it's but it's a penetrable armor\""]
["06:29,380","06:32,820","\"Okay, that's pretty cool. See you know like smoke has the one missing scale. It's like the\""]
["06:32,820","06:40,080","\"One spot on your leg zag if it's over my heart. That's a lot more useful. It's all like you thought that's shit\""]
["06:40,080","06:42,940","\"I don't want it super beetle strike though. That's gross\""]
["06:42,940","06:46,500","\"I don't want to think about a hard leathery black spot on my leg while I'm lifting weights\""]
["06:46,500","06:50,880","\"But what you also turn you to a giant fly it you're all totally it material\""]
["06:50,880","06:56,640","\"I'd rather be a full-end than have one piece of beetle skin on my thigh. Why would you like stop a bullet?\""]
["06:56,640","07:02,140","\"What if what if it can stop a bullet so strong to say FBI was like we need you and your\""]
["07:02,140","07:07,600","\"Invincible if somebody if somebody ever tried to shoot you with a bullet arrow or a bullet in your thigh\""]
["07:07,600","07:13,720","\"Your thigh you can lift them up and throw them. This is dangerously close to an arrow to the knee joke Zach\""]
["07:13,720","07:19,040","\"No, no, that's you a fucking red rat in the swamp\""]
["07:19,040","07:24,880","\"You're at this is the ship does let's you fucking shoot a fireball like Mario\""]

["07:26,880","07:32,880","\"Oh, let me see a really funny family guy parody where it's this guy throwing fireballs and Mario walks and goes,\""]
["07:32,880","07:35,880","\"\"\"What the hell? You can throw fireballs too?\"\"\""]
["07:35,880","07:37,880","\"What do you guys think?\""]

["07:39,880","07:44,880","\"I would love to see Peter Griffin climb the flagpole except he can't climb it because he's too fat.\""]
["07:44,880","07:45,880","\"What the hell?\""]
