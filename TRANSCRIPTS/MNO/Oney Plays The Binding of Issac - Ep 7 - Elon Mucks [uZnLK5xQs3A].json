["00:28,800","00:33,000","\"The point is, it's still such a like,\""]
["00:33,000","00:35,480","\"even with some of the most brilliant minds\""]
["00:35,480","00:37,240","\"in the world backing it,\""]
["00:37,240","00:39,720","\"it's still such a uncharted territory\""]
["00:39,720","00:41,640","\"that things can still go wrong.\""]

["00:46,400","00:49,280","\"- I mean, they very well might,\""]
["00:49,280","00:53,860","\"but to this to date, a single human has never set foot on Mars.\""]
["00:53,860","00:57,520","\"So I feel like there's still a ways to go.\""]
["00:57,520","00:59,320","\"Tomorrow you could be the first.\""]
["00:59,320","01:02,240","\"I don't want to be the first human to go to Mars.\""]

["01:38,560","01:42,760","\"- I want Elon Musk to dip himself into like primordial gel\""]
["01:42,760","01:46,040","\"and become like a god creature.\""]
["01:46,040","01:47,720","\"- Is that how it works?\""]
["01:47,720","01:49,880","\"- Yeah, and then he can call himself Elon Flux.\""]

["02:09,440","02:10,580","\"Same with Rain.\""]

["02:35,680","02:42,960","\"Yeah, he slips in the muck. Yeah, he's covered in muck. Yeah, I don't know what you're talking\""]
["02:42,960","02:46,600","\"And someone takes a big old mucky winner and starts gagging him out\""]
["02:46,600","02:50,120","\"And he spits all the muck into a bowl and when they're all done with him\""]
["02:50,120","02:52,960","\"He's fucking takes the bowl and dumps it on his head\""]
["02:52,960","02:59,440","\"I like the idea of that just him rolling around a mug having a muck filled day\""]
["02:59,440","03:08,480","\"He's from South Africa. I don't know what like he looks like to me. He looks like a Swedish guy maybe\""]
["03:08,480","03:14,040","\"Yeah, he looks like he's got like a he looks like a Nord man who got like hit on the head with a hammer\""]
["03:14,040","03:17,240","\"So his head went down into his neck. I was gonna say it's kind of flat. I\""]
["03:17,240","03:20,040","\"Don't mean that he's very handsome\""]
["03:20,040","03:22,440","\"Do you mean that yeah?\""]
["03:22,440","03:24,960","\"Mmm, I think he he's a handsome guy\""]
["03:24,960","03:28,760","\"Do you think he's really handsome or is he just handsome cuz of all that money?\""]
["03:28,760","03:35,400","\"Definitely the money. Yeah, no, you know, he actually is like he's not a bad looking guy. No, he's he's not afraid\""]
["03:35,400","03:38,720","\"He's not a sec frame. Oh\""]
["03:38,720","03:41,840","\"God\""]
["03:41,840","03:48,180","\"There is a video of him kicking a dog to death though. No, there is no there is he did that he'd be in fucking jail\""]
["03:50,560","03:55,840","\"He would immediately lose his company. It's not a real doggy though because he made it out of like PayPal money\""]
["03:55,840","04:02,880","\"That's the question is if you make your own robot dog. Do you have the right to abuse it? Yeah? I mean I would argue yes\""]
["04:02,880","04:05,640","\"It's just a fucking robot\""]
["04:05,640","04:07,000","\"Tomer that is a good question\""]
["04:07,000","04:12,880","\"You know if if you're playing a game like the Sims 2 you can lock a little Sims 2 dog in a room and set it on fire, right?\""]
["04:12,880","04:13,840","\"Yeah\""]
["04:13,840","04:20,540","\"Would you do that to a real robot dog if you could get it for free every week like a new robot dog free every week?\""]
["04:20,540","04:25,540","\"I don't know that I do it just because like I mean no, but you would do it to a Sims 2 dog\""]
["04:25,540","04:29,900","\"Wouldn't you just to see what would happen? I guess so why not do it to a real robot dog?\""]
["04:29,900","04:32,500","\"just cuz of like\""]
["04:32,500","04:36,900","\"The effort of setting anything on fire in the real world in the dangers\""]
["04:36,900","04:41,140","\"What if you have a butler that'll do it for you all you have to do is say the word I\""]
["04:41,140","04:44,540","\"Don't see the point of it. I wouldn't do it. He's I would feel bad\""]
["04:44,540","04:49,100","\"I would feel fucking weird about it, but isn't it weird that there's technically no difference\""]
["04:50,020","04:55,900","\"Like a simulated dog. Yeah, if anything the Sims one is sort of you could argue\""]
["04:55,900","04:57,900","\"It's worse because it resembles a real dog\""]
["04:57,900","05:00,140","\"Yeah\""]
["05:00,140","05:02,140","\"Yeah, I don't know I\""]
["05:02,140","05:07,860","\"Wouldn't think anyone was a horrible person for doing it although I imagine a horrible person would do it\""]
["05:07,860","05:10,060","\"So it's like\""]
["05:10,060","05:12,540","\"It's not winning you any points with anybody\""]
["05:12,540","05:16,340","\"There are certain things that if you do them in video games people lose their shit\""]
["05:16,340","05:19,460","\"I'm just saying if I had if I had a best friend\""]
["05:19,460","05:26,680","\"And then I found it the only bad thing they ever did was fucking beat a robot dog to death for like two hours straight\""]
["05:26,680","05:34,000","\"I wouldn't I wouldn't like disown them as a friend. That's kind of sadistic though. It's it's pretty weird\""]
["05:34,000","05:36,620","\"But it's still just a robot\""]
["05:36,620","05:41,620","\"Tom are you knowing dark souls the guy at the beginning of the game Oscar? He's the guy who lets you out of your cell. I\""]
["05:41,620","05:47,220","\"Didn't know his name was Oscar. His name is that really his name? Yeah, I actually never knew\""]
["05:47,220","05:53,640","\"But if you kill him in a video online people lose their shit because they like him so much for letting them out\""]
["05:53,640","05:56,780","\"Wait in which Dark Souls Dark Souls one\""]
["05:56,780","06:03,260","\"Wait, is he the guy that you that you see is lying there? He's like yeah. Oh, I'm sorry\""]
["06:03,260","06:05,660","\"I'm dying take my jug\""]
["06:05,660","06:10,340","\"Yeah, if you if you do that then the entire Dark Souls community disowns you forever\""]
["06:10,340","06:16,740","\"It's not that bad, but he's the first guy I kill he gives you like he gives you like three levels worth of experience\""]
["06:16,740","06:24,620","\"Wait, he's gonna say if that were true, then I think people would stop ruining my plan. Yeah, that's true\""]
["06:24,620","06:28,300","\"Get the baby pat you were a bar and wrong\""]
["06:28,300","06:32,960","\"It's like you you can kill shopkeepers and get like you can get the oocha guitar\""]
["06:32,960","06:39,500","\"I really early in the game by killing that one shopkeeper. He doesn't do anything bad to you. He's not like mean or nasty\""]
["06:39,500","06:45,900","\"It's just that he's uh can we all just be real right now the oocha guitar our favorite thing about it\""]
["06:45,900","06:51,000","\"Isn't that it's a powerful weapon. It's the fact that you get to say oochie good Tana. Yeah, it's good. That's correct\""]
["06:51,000","06:59,120","\"Brick also, samurai's are just cool and so are their swords by proxy. That's a good point\""]
["06:59,120","07:06,620","\"Um, I don't think I'm gonna get angel rooms. I don't I only get the capability. I\""]
["07:06,620","07:11,720","\"Think that dark souls remaster is one of the saddest things I've ever seen I\""]
["07:13,020","07:18,740","\"Never actually played the remaster. They fucking they think your face is one of the saddest things I've ever seen\""]
["07:18,740","07:23,020","\"They were a little fucking liars about how they marketed it. They showed this really cool CG trailer\""]
["07:23,020","07:25,020","\"They made you go wow, it's gonna look like that\""]
["07:25,020","07:29,700","\"Yeah, there was like epic boob physics and everything and they just they ruined it\""]
["07:29,700","07:34,600","\"They got rid of everything that no that they literally just released no the game is like nearly\""]
["07:34,600","07:38,300","\"Exactly the same like almost to a tee like the lighting\""]
["07:38,300","07:40,720","\"I had the complaints about the lighting and the fire\""]
["07:42,260","07:45,720","\"They had a chance to fix everything that was wrong and they didn't do it. I\""]
["07:45,720","07:51,440","\"Think it came down to like who they entrusted to do the remade\""]
["07:51,440","07:56,740","\"Yeah, I mean not to throw shade but like I\""]
["07:56,740","08:00,460","\"Don't know if it feels like it's like when people are like well\""]
["08:00,460","08:06,080","\"We got a remake a game, but we don't want to waste the original studios time. So let's just see who's cheap\""]
["08:06,080","08:08,580","\"Hmm\""]
["08:08,580","08:12,620","\"Just sucks. I wish they had a done lost eyes a little better\""]
["08:12,620","08:15,580","\"Just a second half of the game\""]
["08:15,580","08:20,420","\"Wait, which part from like after an Orlando? It gets kind of shitty\""]
["08:20,420","08:25,020","\"They you know what they still have is you know the bed of chaos. Yeah, you can do that trick\""]
["08:25,020","08:28,940","\"Yeah, they still have that that bug you just fucking go in\""]
["08:28,940","08:35,140","\"Slash it up and then just exit out of the game come back do it again. It's the best way to do it\""]
["08:35,140","08:37,900","\"Ugh, it is such a cheesy cheese.\""]
["08:37,900","08:40,820","\"Well, they shouldn't have made it so unfair to begin with.\""]
["08:40,820","08:41,380","\"It's true.\""]
["08:41,380","08:44,580","\"If you try to do that legit, it is a really tough fight.\""]
["08:44,580","08:45,780","\"It's not a fight.\""]
["08:45,780","08:46,780","\"It's just like luck.\""]
["08:46,780","08:47,780","\"It's so stupid.\""]
["08:47,780","08:52,260","\"Chris, I've seen videos of people baiting that boss,\""]
["08:52,260","08:53,180","\"make a...\""]
["08:53,180","08:56,220","\"- Which bear is. - Which boss you guys thought of?\""]
["08:56,220","08:57,220","\"The bad of chaos.\""]
["08:57,220","08:58,100","\"The bad of chaos.\""]
["08:58,100","09:01,940","\"He's that big stupid demon with the two glowing orbs on either side.\""]
["09:01,940","09:03,100","\"You run up his center.\""]
["09:03,100","09:03,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:03,780","09:05,020","\"You run inside of it.\""]
["09:05,020","09:10,940","\"I barely remember that. Yeah, that just proves how long it's been since I've actually played the first Dark Souls\""]
["09:10,940","09:14,620","\"I can barely remember any of Dark Souls - it's like every time I play a new one\""]
["09:14,620","09:18,180","\"It like pushes any memories of the previous game out of my head\""]
["09:18,180","09:24,720","\"You know the thing is is that they're so they are similar and different at the same time like they'll reuse locations\""]
["09:24,720","09:29,180","\"NPCs and all that kind of stuff so I could see it being confusing for some people yeah\""]
["09:29,180","09:32,180","\"yeah, I\""]
["09:32,580","09:35,940","\"I thought everyone's favorite character was Onionhead.\""]
["09:35,940","09:37,840","\"- Sigmayer. - Yeah.\""]
["09:37,840","09:38,840","\"- Katarina.\""]
["09:38,840","09:42,560","\"- I do like Sigmayer. - Mmm.\""]
["09:42,560","09:43,760","\"- He's funny. - Mmm.\""]
["09:43,760","09:46,280","\"He makes funny noise therefore I like him.\""]
["09:46,280","09:47,480","\"All right.\""]
["09:47,480","09:52,920","\"This, I think, makes it so I can, like, break through bricks with my body, but then I get real slow and fat.\""]
["09:52,920","09:54,920","\"Do it. I want to see that.\""]
["09:54,920","09:56,320","\"Thunder thighs.\""]
["09:56,320","09:57,320","\"Oh, look at that.\""]
["09:57,320","09:58,520","\"[Laughing]\""]

["10:00,000","10:00,960","\"That's cool.\""]
["10:00,960","10:02,440","\"So, what's the problem?\""]
["10:02,440","10:03,920","\"You're still pretty fast, right?\""]
["10:03,920","10:06,040","\"Nah, I'll lose a little speed, but I'm fine.\""]
["10:06,040","10:07,120","\"Aww, we're good.\""]
["10:07,120","10:08,560","\"I like that.\""]

["10:25,440","10:28,640","\"Do you think they ever use that for, like, a club-bed commercial?\""]
["10:28,640","10:29,240","\"[Laughs]\""]
["10:29,240","10:32,400","\"Maybe, like, a guy's at the office and he's hating his job,\""]

["10:42,660","10:49,880","\"You're a looser dude, yeah\""]
["10:49,880","10:57,760","\"I'm a dark place. I like that they made it look like an old game\""]
["10:58,400","11:03,520","\"Yeah, it's like how they used to make rooms look dark in like NES era. What was that?\""]
["11:03,520","11:07,520","\"What would they do just using like greys and blues like that take my keys?\""]
["11:07,520","11:15,320","\"I like a pick my key. I wish there was more like adventure type in what to do kind of questy games that weren't just complete horseshit\""]
