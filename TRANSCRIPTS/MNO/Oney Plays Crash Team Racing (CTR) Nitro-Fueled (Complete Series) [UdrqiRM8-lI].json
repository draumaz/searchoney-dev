["05:20,980","05:28,500","\"Asking this because there is a story in this game if the game was just like whatever it's it's cards and that's it\""]
["05:28,500","05:32,460","\"No, that's the thing in every kart racing game people always have their own track because it's like oh\""]
["05:32,460","05:37,840","\"Oh, I get my own track and then they get to spend like four million dollars renovating a place to look like themselves\""]
["05:37,840","05:40,580","\"Does that really that's actually the context? No\""]
["05:40,580","05:47,300","\"This is stupid. Oh wow. I don't want it to spoil the looks of this is so fucking cool looking\""]
["05:47,300","05:55,820","\"Holy moly. Oh, I missed it. Do it. This is amazing. Look at that graphics. Yeah, this actually does look really really good\""]
["05:55,820","05:56,900","\"I assume\""]
["05:56,900","06:00,260","\"None of this is actually assets from the original game, right?\""]
["06:00,260","06:05,140","\"No, but it's not even built on the bones of it like they have to start something like this completely over, right?\""]
["06:05,140","06:11,020","\"Yeah, I think yeah pretty much this fucking feels amazing. It feels just like the original. Oh shit\""]
["06:11,020","06:16,600","\"That's the whole thing so you need to get I missed it you need to get apples to go faster\""]
["06:16,600","06:22,780","\"Sort of like mushrooms. Yeah, exactly. I mean it ripped off Mario Kart for sure, but I think it's more fun\""]
["06:22,780","06:25,560","\"It's a good it's a good thing to rip off. Oh shit\""]
["06:25,560","06:30,560","\"And it's not like there aren't a million other battle racing games besides Mario Kart\""]
["06:30,560","06:33,560","\"So when is the last time you played the original Chris?\""]
["06:33,560","06:35,560","\"Oh like three years ago.\""]
["06:35,560","06:37,560","\"Okay so fairly recent.\""]
["06:37,560","06:38,560","\"Fuckin asshole!\""]
["06:38,560","06:41,560","\"In other words you still remember how it plays.\""]
["06:41,560","06:47,560","\"Oh yeah this isn't like a hazy fever dream memory and you're like oh my brain is filling in exactly what this is.\""]
["06:47,560","06:48,560","\"Oh legitimately.\""]
["06:48,560","06:50,560","\"Yeah no like this feels really spot on.\""]
["06:50,560","06:54,560","\"Okay I'm sure I'm gonna run into something later that I hate but that's great.\""]
["06:54,560","07:04,260","\"That's great the rendering I think is been like crashes fur even and like oh oh just all the little lighting details look really solid look at that\""]
["07:04,260","07:11,160","\"So what was what was the thing that you said about the insane trilogy the lighting or something even even like oh at first?\""]
["07:11,160","07:16,800","\"Yeah, there's there's a certain parts to look really creepy like his eyes are for some reason blue and everything else is lit up\""]
["07:16,800","07:20,180","\"Hmm. It's just nothing that that's remand all the oh\""]
["07:21,240","07:28,040","\"This game looks pretty bright though. Yeah, no honestly, this is fucking beautiful. Okay, we're also playing on the PlayStation Pro\""]
["07:28,040","07:34,680","\"Because we're pro gamers actually so the version we're seeing at least is in 4k. Yeah\""]
["07:34,680","07:38,780","\"Solid\""]
["07:38,780","07:43,680","\"I did it you sure did you're you're the best racist\""]
["07:43,680","07:48,960","\"Look at that. That looks so great. His fate his face\""]

["07:59,500","08:02,500","\"It's called a POS a person of super\""]
["08:02,500","08:08,700","\"Try to wait until the turbo go okay never mind look look\""]
["08:08,700","08:12,600","\"You've got a trophy to put in your giant crash heads mouth\""]
["08:12,600","08:17,560","\"Oh, I guess everyone has their skins unlocked from the beginning because he's not supposed to be a panda\""]
["08:18,160","08:20,160","\"He's not no, he's a little polar bear\""]
["08:20,160","08:25,560","\"How do you know it's the same guy it just definitely is there's no bandicare it's probably\""]
["08:25,560","08:31,360","\"You can go faster through turns join Antifa by following me\""]
["08:31,360","08:37,240","\"There were masks I am a mask I will conceal your face\""]
["08:37,240","08:41,280","\"Cocktail the window the 7/11\""]
["08:45,840","08:52,880","\"Oh man, where's the crash cove? I think this is it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm so happy. I never get to have fun\""]
["08:52,880","08:59,960","\"I never get to enjoy games and after this it's all over big air. It's true savor Chris\""]
["08:59,960","09:05,720","\"I beat this game a hundred percent back in the day as a new kid. I'm not gonna do it again. I don't have the time\""]
["09:05,720","09:08,960","\"But we will experience everything good it has to offer\""]
["09:08,960","09:13,680","\"All of our hairs are all standing up. You know, there's a lot of games\""]
["09:13,680","09:18,320","\"Especially Toma Tomar's beard is actually going completely the opposite direction\""]
["09:18,320","09:24,560","\"Into my face. Yeah, I would say oh three blue. See you get a little turbo\""]
["09:24,560","09:28,440","\"Get out of the way\""]
["09:28,440","09:30,880","\"fucker bomb em bastard\""]
["09:30,880","09:34,760","\"So missile\""]
["09:34,760","09:41,120","\"Well, okay, so you've never played Mario Kart in Mario Kart the further back you are they got rid of a fucking shortcut\""]
["09:41,120","09:45,500","\"Oh, well, it's all over. It's all over from here now Chris is in a bad mood\""]
["09:45,500","09:48,340","\"This is me off\""]
["09:48,340","09:50,340","\"Well, maybe it's there. We'll see\""]
["09:50,340","09:57,520","\"So in Mario Kart the further back you are the better items you get is that the same in this game alright?\""]
["09:57,520","10:02,680","\"That's sort of loser loser take all mentality that\""]
["10:02,680","10:05,360","\"That racing games like to foster\""]
["10:06,280","10:11,660","\"That's life, baby. Oh, I got a shield is there is there a blush. Oh equivalent in this game\""]
["10:11,660","10:15,020","\"Yeah, there's the orb the orb\""]
["10:15,020","10:21,280","\"God oh no, I'm trying to that I'm trying out that shortcut that definitely is not the same my old nemesis the great orb\""]
["10:21,280","10:24,580","\"No, but\""]
["10:24,580","10:30,460","\"So there basically there's an item that the person in eighth place can get that just fucks up the person in first\""]
["10:30,460","10:32,060","\"Yeah, pretty much\""]
["10:32,060","10:36,020","\"Yeah, I don't why do they do that? I don't know. It's probably the worst thing about these games\""]
["10:36,020","10:42,300","\"It's because they think of them as party games. I think when they're being designed so it's just like yeah\""]
["10:42,300","10:45,700","\"Wouldn't it be funny if things could just really dramatically turn around?\""]
["10:45,700","10:51,340","\"I guess that makes sense and then if you see somebody has it you could always like stop and like back up a little bit\""]
["10:51,340","10:55,180","\"Let someone pass you so they get fucked over. Oh, maybe you can do it\""]
["10:55,180","11:00,220","\"Just wait harder. Yeah, you probably just lost the muscle memory for it in your old age\""]
["11:00,220","11:03,820","\"I definitely have not lost the muscle memory. You're disgusting crinkly\""]
["11:03,820","11:05,820","\"You just love fingers of...\""]
["11:05,820","11:08,220","\"No, I swear, I know what I'm talking about.\""]
["11:08,220","11:10,220","\"Okay, it does feel different.\""]
["11:10,220","11:12,460","\"Oh, there's Object Motherfucker.\""]
["11:12,460","11:13,520","\"What?\""]
["11:13,520","11:14,520","\"You know that story?\""]
["11:14,520","11:15,520","\"Object Motherfucker?\""]
["11:15,520","11:19,520","\"Yeah, one of the bad guys in the game code is called Object.Motherfucker.\""]
["11:19,520","11:21,020","\"Woo!\""]
["11:21,020","11:23,520","\"Okay, someone just forgot to like rename it.\""]
["11:23,520","11:27,020","\"Well, they probably didn't think kids would open it up and dig through the...\""]
["11:27,020","11:27,520","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:27,520","11:28,520","\"I would think that they would.\""]
["11:28,520","11:30,020","\"Back then, they didn't do that kind of shit.\""]
["11:30,020","11:31,700","\"- I actually really liked the E back in the day.\""]
["11:31,700","11:34,260","\"You could put a PS1 or PS2 disk in your drive\""]
["11:34,260","11:36,740","\"and it would actually read the files.\""]
["11:36,740","11:39,500","\"- I remember you could watch certain cutscenes and shit.\""]
["11:39,500","11:40,340","\"- Yeah.\""]
["11:40,340","11:45,340","\"- Yeah, you could straight up play old Sega Genesis games,\""]
["11:45,340","11:46,100","\"I think.\""]
["11:46,100","11:46,940","\"- Really?\""]
["11:46,940","11:49,380","\"- There was some Sega console where you could just put\""]
["11:49,380","11:51,100","\"the disk in the computer and they would play.\""]
["11:51,100","11:53,460","\"You couldn't save the game, I don't think,\""]
["11:53,460","11:55,540","\"but you could play it.\""]
["11:55,540","11:56,380","\"- Really?\""]
["11:56,380","11:58,980","\"- Yeah, 'cause I had a couple.\""]
["11:58,980","12:02,080","\"like sega c_d_ maybe\""]
["12:02,080","12:04,480","\"oh yeah i think i think it was because uh...\""]
["12:04,480","12:06,760","\"the sonic was sonic boom on it\""]
["12:06,760","12:10,120","\"remember my friend showing me that he had a genesis\""]
["12:10,120","12:14,680","\"it's pretty crazy that uh... their first car racing game was really good\""]
["12:14,680","12:16,120","\"yeah but it was uh...\""]
["12:16,120","12:19,880","\"was not their first game the first sonic car racing game on a mean that\""]
["12:19,880","12:20,760","\"notty dogs\""]
["12:20,760","12:24,360","\"like oh like this game like they had made three platformers and then he just\""]
["12:24,360","12:27,320","\"naced the fucking car racing game first try\""]
["12:27,320","12:30,960","\"I never actually got super into Jack X.\""]
["12:30,960","12:32,720","\"I don't remember if it was any good or not,\""]
["12:32,720","12:35,200","\"but they did it with Jack and Daxter too.\""]
["12:35,200","12:37,160","\"- Was Jack X was a racing game?\""]
["12:37,160","12:38,760","\"- Yeah, so they did Jack one, two, and three,\""]
["12:38,760","12:39,600","\"and then they did Jack X, which was--\""]
["12:39,600","12:40,640","\"- That's a little deceptive.\""]
["12:40,640","12:42,120","\"I feel like if I was a kid in the store\""]
["12:42,120","12:43,280","\"and I just saw Jack X,\""]
["12:43,280","12:46,000","\"I would think it was the new cool Jack game.\""]
["12:46,000","12:48,880","\"- Well, he's definitely, it doesn't hide it at all.\""]
["12:48,880","12:49,720","\"- Okay.\""]
["12:49,720","12:54,960","\"- Yeah, it's, I don't think it has like the Mario card items.\""]
["12:54,960","12:56,560","\"It's been so long since I played it,\""]
["12:56,560","12:57,560","\"I never owned it.\""]
["12:57,560","13:01,280","\"I feel like if you didn't have the Mario Kart items it would just be like a straight\""]
["13:01,280","13:02,280","\"racing game.\""]
["13:02,280","13:04,360","\"Well your cars have guns and shit on them.\""]
["13:04,360","13:05,360","\"Oh okay.\""]

["13:08,400","13:10,760","\"I was more like twisted metal than like.\""]
["13:10,760","13:11,760","\"Yeah yeah.\""]
["13:11,760","13:13,480","\"What was that guy?\""]
["13:13,480","13:15,560","\"Or did twisted metal also just have weapons you picked up?\""]
["13:15,560","13:16,560","\"I don't know.\""]
["13:16,560","13:17,560","\"Never mind.\""]
["13:17,560","13:19,720","\"In twisted metal you weren't supposed to like win a race were you?\""]
["13:19,720","13:21,720","\"I thought twisted metal was like a arena thing.\""]
["13:21,720","13:22,720","\"That's right.\""]
["13:22,720","13:26,040","\"I think well it may have had more different modes and now I can't remember.\""]
["13:26,040","13:26,880","\"Oh well.\""]
["13:26,880","13:27,720","\"Yeah.\""]
["13:27,720","13:30,440","\"You know what game I really like for like racing games like this is did you ever play\""]

["13:32,440","13:33,440","\"I love burnout.\""]
["13:33,440","13:34,920","\"Yeah burnout was fun as fuck.\""]
["13:34,920","13:39,640","\"No that they really got down like I always wanted a game where I could like shove people\""]
["13:39,640","13:43,240","\"off the road and they got that to be so satisfying.\""]
["13:43,240","13:46,800","\"It's very apparent by the way you drive Tomar.\""]
["13:46,800","13:50,120","\"Tomar is like the nicest person I've ever met in my life.\""]
["13:50,120","13:54,720","\"Like honestly like if somebody has a problem with Tomar I kind of don't like him.\""]
["13:54,720","13:57,160","\"There's like very few people that do.\""]

["14:14,600","14:17,600","\"I'm still having to explain to the families what happened.\""]

["14:19,040","14:21,480","\"You couldn't do that in the original.\""]
["14:21,480","14:23,960","\"You can't, you couldn't beep.\""]
["14:23,960","14:26,760","\"Nope. See that's a feature add-on.\""]
["14:26,760","14:31,960","\"Oh, I thought I can't wait for the YouTube think piece about how this game changed for the worse\""]
["14:31,960","14:36,560","\"and how the addition of the beep messed with the fundamental balance of it.\""]
["14:36,560","14:40,760","\"It's possible because you can fucking ruin people's lives by beeping.\""]
["14:40,760","14:41,760","\"Yeah.\""]

["14:46,460","14:46,960","\"Beep beep.\""]
["14:46,960","14:49,960","\"The old game didn't have a beep and it wasn't just fun.\""]
["14:49,960","14:52,960","\"This was an intentional choice on the part of the developer.\""]
["14:52,960","14:57,640","\"You do something like a real like did you know gaming youtuber?\""]
["14:57,640","15:04,460","\"But now the addition of the beep has messed with the whole balance now people are having fun even when they don't have the items\""]
["15:04,460","15:08,360","\"Which messes with the essential ebb and flow of the end I don't know\""]
["15:08,360","15:18,080","\"Watch off that turtle you got this\""]
["15:20,840","15:23,740","\"Tiny tiger wins that was so fucking close\""]
["15:23,740","15:30,800","\"Second actually is this like Mario Kart where you can kind of like pull yourself back if you don't win one\""]
["15:30,800","15:33,600","\"Or do you got to just win every time? Oh, it makes you retry you really have to\""]
["15:33,600","15:38,400","\"Depends on how well the other person that just beat him winds up doing in the other race\""]
["15:38,400","15:41,040","\"I could just for it would have let me go by being second\""]
["15:41,040","15:41,320","\"Yeah\""]
["15:41,320","15:47,040","\"Well Mario Kart what it does is you you play like four races and just kind of whoever has like the best score at the end of that\""]
["15:47,280","15:52,620","\"wins oh no fucking you can't fucking get out of those unless you have like a\""]

["15:57,240","16:02,340","\"we're seven that we can get something stupid like the mag items yeah and you\""]
["16:02,340","16:07,040","\"can fucking kill people see you're just fucking ripping through all of them\""]
["16:07,040","16:13,260","\"oh is tiny tiger always like the big guy to beat like do they have like\""]
["16:13,260","16:16,560","\"different difficulties because he's he's he's not supposed to be that good he's\""]
["16:16,560","16:18,560","\"got like really bad at turning.\""]
["16:18,560","16:19,260","\"No, right.\""]
["16:19,260","16:24,980","\"I bet at the start of the race it like just like rolls a die on what kind of like AI\""]
["16:24,980","16:26,480","\"each one of them is going to have.\""]
["16:26,480","16:29,640","\"Well, I'm only bringing it up because he got second on the last one and then he beat\""]
["16:29,640","16:31,680","\"you the time after that.\""]
["16:31,680","16:32,680","\"So yeah.\""]
["16:32,680","16:35,880","\"He does seem like he.\""]

["17:01,240","17:04,680","\"Fractions of a second\""]
["17:04,680","17:10,500","\"Can you drift in this game like if you're behind somebody to use speed up yeah well no draft yeah\""]
["17:11,560","17:16,380","\"You could do that you can kill people which is very beautiful in a and Mario Kart\""]
["17:16,380","17:20,580","\"And I'm not sure if this was added until the later games if you get like right up somebody's ass\""]
["17:20,580","17:26,380","\"You you get like a speed boost. That's called something. It's not called drafting. I thought it was called draft\""]
["17:26,380","17:30,940","\"I think Tomar's right. I think it is called drafting. Oh if it's not called drafting then I'm doubling down\""]
["17:30,940","17:37,620","\"It's it's called something really fucking weird. I think is when you drift. We all know what drifting is just because you like the movie\""]
["17:38,820","17:46,480","\"Accurate title Tokyo drift where they blatantly misrepresent what a drift actually is I watched a lot of initial D\""]
["17:46,480","17:51,120","\"I know what a drift is oh all right. It's called something fucking weird. I'm telling you look up burnout\""]

["18:00,960","18:08,040","\"You got 40 fruit coins. That's the shitty thing is you can be really good, but bad items will just fucking kill you\""]
["18:08,040","18:12,720","\"It's not fair. Yeah, I mean these games aren't made to be like hyper-competitive, right? No\""]
["18:12,720","18:15,320","\"But they are made to be hyper\""]
["18:15,320","18:17,960","\"Come drafting or slipstreaming\""]
["18:17,960","18:22,400","\"Slipsreaming that was it it's a sad me it's a fucking sin and no, but it's a cooler word\""]
["18:22,400","18:24,360","\"streaming\""]
["18:24,360","18:30,760","\"Drafting or slipstreaming is an aerodynamic technique where two vehicles or other moving objects are caused to align in a close group\""]

["18:50,860","19:00,760","\"Slipstream me the Tomars anger breaks the wind resistance and you go really really fast. Whoa, there's a big door\""]
["19:01,840","19:04,880","\"Open it with a giant key big door keys\""]
["19:04,880","19:11,840","\"Level here\""]

["24:04,340","24:06,340","\"so to represent earth in\""]
["24:06,420","24:10,720","\"This race for the planet so this is all like altruistic wacky\""]
