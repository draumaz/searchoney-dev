["00:42,140","00:45,920","\"I remember maybe just 'cause I was a stupid fucking kid,\""]
["00:45,920","00:47,520","\"but I remember this one kicking my ass\""]

["02:05,640","02:08,920","\"I just want a little witch to fly by.\""]
["02:08,920","02:11,880","\"The whole forest is interconnected.\""]

["02:26,560","02:27,560","\"We gotta look through--\""]

["02:43,440","02:45,000","\"It was at least 50-50.\""]
["02:45,000","02:46,520","\"- You're right.\""]

["03:44,380","03:46,900","\"It turns out they do because they overshot where they were going\""]
["03:47,420","03:50,220","\"We think that you put little stilts on the ants feet\""]
["03:50,220","03:54,300","\"So they count their steps to like get to places yeah\""]
["03:54,300","03:59,960","\"So if they go away from the hive or the nest or whatever is called they count their steps to get back in what direction\""]
["03:59,960","04:04,120","\"That's weird. I know how do they there's smart little fellas\""]

["04:28,940","04:30,460","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:30,460","04:33,060","\"- You're out in the woods, starving in near death.\""]
["04:33,060","04:36,060","\"And right in your fleeting last moments,\""]

["04:43,860","04:45,340","\"- That's when you fall off the cliff.\""]
["04:45,340","04:47,340","\"You got in the forest.\""]
["04:47,340","04:49,340","\"You also put the stilts on your hands too.\""]
["04:49,340","04:53,340","\"So you're really going around like those creepy guys from Return of Oz.\""]
["04:53,340","04:55,340","\"The wheelers.\""]
["04:55,340","04:57,340","\"Okay, a new experiment.\""]
["04:57,340","05:01,340","\"Sand a bunch of kids out into the woods with stilts on their hands and put wheels in the bottom.\""]
["05:01,340","05:03,340","\"Are you asking your comment section?\""]
["05:03,340","05:05,340","\"Yes, someone out there who has a kid.\""]
["05:05,340","05:09,340","\"I know what to say is asking. It's more demanding.\""]
["05:09,340","05:11,340","\"Okay, uh, fucking Eddie, you with your kid.\""]
["05:11,340","05:16,500","\"with your kid. Put your kid out in the woods, put stilts on his hands and feet, and put\""]
["05:16,500","05:23,500","\"wheels in the bottom. I want to fucking use her big ass thing like a sleeping bag.\""]
["05:23,500","05:31,740","\"I'm inside. There's a bunch of ants in there though. Jack off in her.\""]
["05:31,740","05:33,740","\"Don't do that.\""]
["05:33,740","05:35,740","\"Lyle.\""]
["05:35,740","05:39,740","\"This is a channel for everyone.\""]

["05:42,740","05:44,740","\"That's gross.\""]
["05:44,740","05:46,740","\"He's licking her out.\""]
["05:46,740","05:48,740","\"He is.\""]
["05:48,740","05:49,740","\"He's going to rip that.\""]
["05:49,740","05:50,740","\"I did it.\""]
["05:50,740","05:51,740","\"I tasted that pussy.\""]
["05:51,740","05:52,740","\"Alright, your turn.\""]
["05:52,740","05:55,740","\"I'd like to fill her with my larvae.\""]
["05:55,740","05:57,740","\"Is that Linkara?\""]
["05:57,740","06:00,740","\"I'd like to fill her with my larvae.\""]
["06:00,740","06:06,340","\"Oh jeez. That was tricky. Yeah, it was pretty fucking tricky.\""]
["06:06,340","06:10,580","\"Wow, I didn't know you'd know who Link there was.\""]
["06:10,580","06:14,380","\"All right, I'll do it this time.\""]
["06:14,380","06:15,780","\"I swear to you, Chris.\""]
["06:15,780","06:16,180","\"You know how?\""]
["06:16,180","06:18,940","\"Yeah, this is what hell looks like.\""]
["06:18,940","06:22,060","\"Why is your bandages in that block?\""]
["06:22,060","06:27,580","\"By the way, which one of you has the world's sweatiest fucking hands?\""]
["06:28,140","06:33,140","\"<cjd3> that's why i was playing it\""]
["06:33,140","06:35,140","\"I played it like four hours ago.\""]
["06:35,140","06:38,140","\"Maybe it's just collective sweat between both of you.\""]
["06:38,140","06:42,140","\"You know what? Ding dong. I think you might have sweaty hands.\""]
["06:42,140","06:45,140","\"Well, well fuck.\""]
["06:45,140","06:47,140","\"You know, you're really pissing me off.\""]
["06:47,140","06:50,140","\"I used to be like legit at this game. What happened?\""]
["06:50,140","06:55,140","\"All these games we picked out that they have weird controls that I can't get used to.\""]
["06:55,140","06:57,140","\"I don't...\""]
["06:57,140","06:59,140","\"Playing it again, this game actually...\""]
["06:59,140","07:02,140","\"I think I had like it more than I did when I was a kid.\""]
["07:02,140","07:06,140","\"Listen to you guys like some more than they did in the child.\""]
["07:06,140","07:07,140","\"I remember.\""]
["07:07,140","07:13,140","\"Now that nostalgia is not a factor, I actually have a higher opinion of this game that I'm nostalgic about.\""]
["07:13,140","07:15,140","\"Thank you very much.\""]
["07:15,140","07:20,140","\"I remember this was getting bad reviews at the time as a kid and I was like, \"\"I don't know. I know it was alright.\"\"\""]
["07:20,140","07:23,140","\"But, uh, playing it now, I actually kind of like...\""]
["07:23,140","07:26,140","\"I've never seen a game with this kind of mechanic before.\""]
["07:26,140","07:30,140","\"Yeah, it's a cool idea and they really take advantage of it like that boss I just fought.\""]
["07:30,140","07:32,140","\"I was actually cool. Yeah\""]
["07:32,140","07:38,740","\"And you get good at it like you need to be really quick about it. I like it. I like you say is I fucking\""]
["07:38,740","07:41,660","\"Eat shit Colossal\""]
["07:41,660","07:47,140","\"The camera angles suck. Yes spatially kind of reasoning this shit out\""]
["07:47,140","07:51,340","\"Yes, not it I wish they didn't go bankrupt because if they did a third game\""]
["07:51,340","07:53,800","\"Maybe they could have actually turned this into something pretty good\""]
["07:53,800","07:59,140","\"Was the sec I didn't play the second one. I only played the second one added a couple mechanics\""]
["07:59,140","08:06,820","\"I know the second one gave you like a parachute. Yeah, you have you have a parachute you can open and also you can grab on to any wall in the game\""]
["08:06,820","08:09,900","\"That's pretty neat, but uh\""]
["08:09,900","08:13,980","\"There were power-ups too. They added some things go like it a little bit better\""]
["08:13,980","08:16,620","\"Well watch out. Well watch out\""]
["08:16,620","08:22,540","\"If they made a game that had like a ton of levels whoa whoa it'd be cool. Wow, that was great\""]
["08:22,540","08:26,980","\"Why don't you shoot it like an arrow? Why does it spin out? You should be dealing with it. Fuck\""]
["08:28,380","08:30,380","\"Okay, I wanted the life black\""]
["08:30,380","08:33,420","\"You fucking\""]
["08:33,420","08:36,380","\"Well, are you taking the mic no?\""]
["08:36,380","08:39,460","\"wait, yes, I\""]
["08:39,460","08:46,700","\"Fucking totally forgot to zoom out that you forgot to zoom out the camera - I just realized I didn't quite the entire\""]
["08:46,700","08:52,420","\"The entirety of ant world without a I think I zoomed out the start. I didn't during the boss though\""]
["08:52,420","08:57,100","\"So it's really windy those clouds are moving quick. Yeah, they are\""]
["08:57,100","08:58,100","\"I'm not taking any books for this.\""]
["08:58,100","09:03,740","\"It's making fun of the people that aren't like me.\""]
["09:03,740","09:07,380","\"It's making fun of them because this game is fun and you shouldn't be making entertainment\""]
["09:07,380","09:08,380","\"out of this.\""]
["09:08,380","09:09,380","\"Yeah, exactly.\""]
["09:09,380","09:14,780","\"You know, a funny observation is that if he was to make Felicia with a beautiful woman,\""]
["09:14,780","09:17,460","\"she'd probably enjoy it very much.\""]
["09:17,460","09:19,500","\"He'd be going up her fucking guts.\""]
["09:19,500","09:21,380","\"You'd get all the way into her uterus.\""]
["09:21,380","09:22,580","\"He'd kill her.\""]
["09:22,580","09:24,380","\"He probably would.\""]
