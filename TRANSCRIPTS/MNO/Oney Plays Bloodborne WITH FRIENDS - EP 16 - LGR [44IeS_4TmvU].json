["03:04,780","03:07,660","\"I knew you would.\""]
["03:07,660","03:08,180","\"Oh.\""]
["03:08,180","03:10,380","\"Do you think there will ever be a Bloodborne sequel making?\""]
["03:10,380","03:12,180","\"I thought there was.\""]
["03:12,180","03:13,280","\"You're triggering.\""]
["03:13,280","03:14,180","\"There's not.\""]
["03:14,180","03:15,980","\"I thought there was like five of them.\""]
["03:15,980","03:16,480","\"No.\""]
["03:16,480","03:17,380","\"They will.\""]
["03:17,380","03:17,880","\"Something.\""]
["03:17,880","03:19,880","\"I wouldn't be.\""]
["03:19,880","03:23,580","\"There's Dark Soul Bloodborne, Splatter Man.\""]
["03:23,580","03:25,580","\"Oh, Splatter House.\""]
["03:25,580","03:26,580","\"It seems like Dark Souls.\""]
["03:26,580","03:27,780","\"Can we play Splatter House?\""]
["03:27,780","03:28,780","\"Yes.\""]
["03:28,780","03:30,080","\"Oh, that's a classic.\""]
["03:30,080","03:31,080","\"Evil Lair.\""]
["03:31,080","03:32,580","\"Uh.\""]
["03:32,580","03:33,980","\"Wait, what the shit?\""]
["03:33,980","03:34,980","\"Does this game happen to me?\""]
["03:34,980","03:36,680","\"Oh, oh, fucking hell.\""]
["03:36,680","03:37,780","\"Does this game have any lore?\""]
["03:37,780","03:41,380","\"I mean not this game does Dark Souls 3 have any lore from Dark Souls 2?\""]
["03:41,380","03:44,660","\"No, but I know that's cool\""]
["03:44,660","03:47,140","\"I'm glad\""]
["03:47,140","03:49,220","\"This controller does that thing where sometimes?\""]
["03:49,220","03:57,580","\"The gestures get triggered by your controller. Yeah somehow. Oh really? Yeah, so that's why I bowed all of a sudden\""]
["03:57,580","04:02,020","\"It's not your fault. I don't know why that's even an option in this game\""]
["04:03,460","04:05,460","\"Tell me this Chris. Oh\""]
["04:05,460","04:10,540","\"How many times will they make a game that plays just like Dark Souls, and then you get sick of it?\""]
["04:10,540","04:15,340","\"I mean this they're already doing that there's already a bunch of I mean I like Dark Souls games to do it\""]
["04:15,340","04:21,780","\"I don't like the kind of rip-off. I know but I'm saying from software. How many more times can they do this formula before you'd start getting sick of it?\""]
["04:21,780","04:26,420","\"I mean it feels like it's own genre to me, so I wouldn't get sick of it. It's like say yeah\""]
["04:26,420","04:31,940","\"I think it's almost like saying like a fighting game like oh, yeah a 2d fighting game\""]
["04:31,940","04:50,940","\"I think that's like a game. I think that's like a game. I find it hard to believe you would get sick of 2D fighting games. Yeah. This is its own genre and the people who made it do it best so. I also feel like, wasn't there that like Japanese kind of lore game that came out that was kind of the same?\""]
["04:50,940","04:51,940","\"What?\""]
["04:51,940","04:56,940","\"There was a game that came out. Did I show you that? Yeah. The Japanese one. It looks like a super animator. Oh, a slicer slicer?\""]
["04:56,940","05:01,140","\"Slice your slicer slicer slicer X and then there's Lords of the Fallen\""]
["05:01,140","05:03,140","\"Which is the worst shit I ever touched in my life?\""]
["05:03,140","05:09,140","\"Which was just basically a huge ripoff and then the sequel was the prequel Lords of the not fallen\""]
["05:09,140","05:11,780","\"Yeah, and then there's salt in the sanctuary, but I've never played it\""]
["05:11,780","05:14,660","\"So unsanctuary was interesting\""]
["05:14,660","05:22,780","\"Can you ever get past that notion of being like it's trying really hard though, so it just doesn't feel new\""]
["05:23,220","05:27,940","\"Yeah, you know what the fighting game was a fair comparison. I would say something like mobas\""]
["05:27,940","05:32,460","\"I got sick of that really fast mobas cuz there's so many like DOTA Wow\""]
["05:32,460","05:40,100","\"Yeah, there's so goddamn many of them that once it's oversaturated just enough. I never enjoyed that style of game anyway\""]
["05:40,100","05:44,860","\"Insane you did I don't know I'm just saying\""]
["05:44,860","05:51,140","\"There's a ton of it coming out and gets old and there was a window of that for fighting games\""]
["05:51,140","05:57,780","\"I mean that's not having the first-person shooters for a while - it's just everything you can happen with platformers like this\""]
["05:57,780","06:02,420","\"Happened with tech space games. It's just you think it's gonna happen to you is what I'm asking\""]
["06:02,420","06:06,100","\"You're gonna eventually get sick of it, but they start pump something is out\""]
["06:06,100","06:09,980","\"I don't think I'll ever not give a game created by this guy a chance\""]
["06:09,980","06:13,500","\"It just seems like he's always trying really hard and he always has good ideas\""]
["06:13,500","06:16,220","\"What?\""]
["06:16,220","06:17,220","\"Is that glitching?\""]
["06:17,220","06:18,220","\"I broke it!\""]
["06:18,220","06:20,220","\"Is that supposed to do?\""]
["06:20,220","06:21,220","\"Noooooo!\""]
["06:21,220","06:23,220","\"They're gonna have not a poofers.\""]
["06:23,220","06:24,220","\"They did.\""]
["06:24,220","06:25,780","\"What the shit?\""]
["06:25,780","06:27,220","\"Has that never done that before?\""]
["06:27,220","06:28,220","\"No!\""]
["06:28,220","06:31,500","\"I'm afraid to walk in front of it now.\""]
["06:31,500","06:32,500","\"What the shit?\""]
["06:32,500","06:34,500","\"What was that?\""]
["06:34,500","06:39,140","\"Has there ever been like another game pretty much exactly like Pokemon where you catch\""]
["06:39,140","06:40,140","\"monsters and...\""]
["06:40,140","06:41,140","\"I don't think so.\""]
["06:41,140","06:42,140","\"Is that like patented?\""]
["06:42,140","06:43,140","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:43,140","06:44,140","\"DJ Man.\""]
["06:44,140","06:46,140","\"There's been plenty of games like that.\""]
["06:46,140","06:54,020","\"Monster quest where you can capture a bunch of monsters. Yeah on dude on your phone. There's a hundred Pokemon clones\""]
["06:54,020","06:59,020","\"Oh on your phone doesn't count if you mean around that time. Yeah, they had like monster rancher going on PlayStation\""]
["06:59,020","07:04,780","\"I guess I've never played you on you did you want ever work like that? No, they don't work the same\""]
["07:04,780","07:10,340","\"I mean the genre of like like going from town to town like beating. Yeah, they had Robo Pawn. They had a okay\""]
["07:10,340","07:13,340","\"Okay, well, I've never heard of that. I've never heard of that either. There's a\""]
["07:13,500","07:17,260","\"Telefane they did lots of lots of games like that. I never heard of any of those\""]
["07:17,260","07:23,020","\"Were they good? No, then that's why we never heard of them. Hmm. They might as well never oh\""]
["07:23,020","07:29,820","\"Beauty yeah, this place is beauty of beauty. I like I suck they're grab you in their snakes and squeeze\""]
["07:29,820","07:36,500","\"They fuck you up so bad air bad news. Tell me this is never play dragons dog. Yeah, that I wanted to play\""]
["07:36,500","07:38,660","\"I actually like the combat and a lot. I\""]
["07:39,220","07:45,380","\"Think it's I don't like the world at all now, but I do like grabbing on to enemies and everything\""]
["07:45,380","07:51,400","\"It's a it's fun combat plus you can change things together, which is pretty fun. Yeah, I don't know\""]
["07:51,400","07:54,060","\"There's certain things I like and most things I don't I\""]
["07:54,060","08:00,800","\"Don't like the pawn system. Do you like one-eyed wheelie? I do like what I do\""]
["08:00,800","08:05,700","\"Did you like dragons dog? I never played I wanted to I couldn't get into it\""]
["08:07,900","08:09,900","\"Shitty Shitty story\""]
["08:09,900","08:13,020","\"Then the world didn't feel very good\""]
["08:13,020","08:16,140","\"Just felt really bland\""]
["08:16,140","08:19,580","\"I had no title string music did it?\""]
["08:19,580","08:26,140","\"Did you ever hear it? No, it starts off just sounding like a nice little\""]
["08:26,140","08:29,100","\"classical composition\""]
["08:29,100","08:37,260","\"I was really wishing that that was a soundtrack for the game. Oh, but it's not\""]
["08:37,260","08:39,820","\"It's just the title screen and they got rid of it\""]
["08:39,820","08:44,900","\"What the patch they did a patch and the patch removes it what?\""]
["08:44,900","08:50,240","\"Was it people were rocking too hard or it was a license song?\""]
["08:50,240","08:54,860","\"Why does this guy dream the same thing every night every night is that justified in?\""]
["08:54,860","08:58,540","\"Universe they have this basically a dream\""]
["08:58,540","09:04,820","\"Kind of yes the actual place and it's just called the hunters dream it is called the hunters dream\""]
["09:04,820","09:12,160","\"This is yeah, I don't actually I can't explain the lore exactly\""]
["09:12,160","09:18,240","\"There's there's whole videos on the lore that I will never watch I actually enjoy them\""]
["09:18,240","09:22,040","\"I've read lots or I've seen lots of different lists of you\""]
["09:22,040","09:27,520","\"Don't you want to watch the lore of Spyro the dragon if there's a if there's a if it's okay\""]
["09:27,520","09:34,080","\"Here's here's a way to guarantee to that I watch a video is it's got to be over an hour long\""]
["09:34,080","09:40,360","\"of talking that I don't have to look at the screen for so that I can keep working while I listen that's fair got to be\""]
["09:40,360","09:42,880","\"informative and\""]
["09:42,880","09:46,640","\"Interesting those are the kind of videos that I like you know what?\""]
["09:46,640","09:50,720","\"For me what is people stuttering and not editing? Yes\""]
["09:50,720","09:54,860","\"I'm sorry not something that I you have to it also\""]
["09:54,860","10:00,800","\"It can't be an hour long because this was an unedited like first take that you didn't bother fucking\""]
["10:01,160","10:08,540","\"You know going back to rerecord also when you started my favorite thing is analysis channels and every single video is formatted the same way\""]
["10:08,540","10:11,860","\"And ridden the same way so they say it's just ridiculous\""]
["10:11,860","10:17,140","\"It's like they didn't even try and then you watch the next video and they say it's like they didn't even try\""]
["10:17,140","10:21,380","\"It was no effort put into this I like people with very relaxed voices\""]
["10:21,380","10:26,480","\"I need to get I need to start listening to more audiobooks because that would be an easy solution to oh, yeah\""]
["10:27,080","10:32,960","\"Audi books are great to do and I know I never do it. I said it before but lazy game reviews is a very good channel\""]
["10:32,960","10:38,360","\"I've watched through almost everything I think I have to but I can go back and still put them on\""]
