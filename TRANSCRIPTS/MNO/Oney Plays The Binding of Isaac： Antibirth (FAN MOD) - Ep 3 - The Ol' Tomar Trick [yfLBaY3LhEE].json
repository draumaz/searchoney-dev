["05:53,820","05:55,200","\"Yeah, like underneath the stairs\""]
["05:55,200","05:57,660","\"So it started shitting just in the basement floor right in the middle of it\""]
["05:57,660","06:01,060","\"And then I show I was there with shed and we got a plastic bag\""]
["06:01,900","06:10,900","\"And we filled up a garbage bag. There was hair all over him. Like little white, like little brown white hair colored\""]

["08:07,420","08:07,920","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:07,920","08:11,180","\"It sounds like there's like a now a mini boss roaming the level.\""]
["08:11,180","08:12,920","\"Oh, no, no, no, no.\""]
["08:12,920","08:15,220","\"It would just be it. You have access to it later.\""]
["08:15,220","08:19,820","\"Oh, that's something I was thinking about for the video game I'm making.\""]
["08:19,820","08:20,560","\"What that?\""]
["08:20,720","08:21,920","\"Um\""]
["08:21,920","08:25,900","\"So here's the thing uh since the game I'm trying to make it kind of for speedrunner\""]
["08:25,900","08:26,320","\"E types\""]
["08:26,320","08:31,820","\"Yeah, so that they can blast through the game and do all these like cool maneuvers to get through as fast as possible\""]
["08:31,820","08:33,820","\"Yeah, but it's not really like\""]
["08:33,820","08:40,480","\"People who don't speedrun are obviously like can enjoy it too, but um speedrunners really hate\""]
["08:40,480","08:43,420","\"They really hate random chance of things happening\""]
["08:43,420","08:48,560","\"Because it could fuck up a speedrun right when you're at the end of it. Well, that's the risk reward though\""]
["08:48,560","08:50,820","\"Yeah, I know but like in this case\""]
["08:50,820","08:56,120","\"I was thinking about having like certain things roam the world as you're running through it\""]
["08:56,120","08:59,460","\"But if you run into it, there's a really good chance like you'll fucking die or whatever\""]
["08:59,460","09:01,620","\"Okay, so it's kind of like the scary thing\""]
["09:01,620","09:07,900","\"But I also don't know if that's fun or fair or if people would even enjoy that you could do what per cuz like persona\""]
["09:07,900","09:14,500","\"Yeah, as villains like that where like you get sort of punished for taking too long in a dungeon and then oh\""]
["09:14,860","09:19,180","\"Like this like super powerful enemy will show up, but only after a certain amount of time\""]
["09:19,180","09:24,380","\"Wow, so if it was done in a way like that then speedrunners would never have to worry about it\""]
["09:24,380","09:28,380","\"Gotcha. Just a thought, but it's also oh, that's a good point\""]
["09:28,380","09:33,980","\"Yeah, I guess there's a few ways you can kind of make it fun and fair. Hey, Tim. Are you pretty smart?\""]
["09:33,980","09:37,780","\"What's your smart score\""]
["09:37,780","09:41,620","\"How many smarts do you have I have one another way to do it is yeah?\""]
["09:41,940","09:46,920","\"If you just leave them standing still for a while big uncircumstances show up and fuck you up\""]
["09:46,920","09:51,640","\"Like I liked it in Final Fantasy 7 when you could see those like weapons roaming the earth\""]
["09:51,640","09:56,880","\"I thought yeah, that made them really cool. Yeah, man when Naboo mats who dies. I'm gonna be so fucking sad\""]
["09:56,880","10:01,580","\"That's gonna be one of the few times when I'm actually devastated over someone dying that I don't know\""]
["10:01,580","10:05,560","\"Naboo no boo no boo\""]
["10:05,560","10:07,620","\"No boy\""]
["10:07,620","10:09,980","\"Isn't that a planet in fucking Star Wars?\""]
["10:09,980","10:14,820","\"Why would you name your Japanese child after a fucking Star Wars planet?\""]
["10:14,820","10:18,040","\"There's a guy who works in Ralph's looks just like no boo. I'm at\""]
["10:18,040","10:21,260","\"Oh fuck. I\""]
["10:21,260","10:23,460","\"Think you heard me say it one time\""]
["10:23,460","10:30,820","\"Did he did he get upset? Is that in did he find it insulting? Yeah? He said that fucking musician sucks my dick. Oh\""]
["10:30,820","10:35,760","\"Then he said something about Koji Kondo being better fuck him fuck him\""]
["10:36,660","10:42,580","\"Open your mouth eat my tears didn't app drink my tears. Hey Tomar\""]
["10:42,580","10:47,980","\"Yeah, I heard that the only reason you like Jojo is because other people like it\""]
["10:47,980","10:57,580","\"No, that's actually the thing that's actually the reason why I avoided Jojo for like years\""]
["10:57,580","11:01,100","\"Because I was getting annoyed at how much other people liked it\""]
["11:01,100","11:01,620","\"Yeah\""]
["11:01,620","11:05,420","\"I think like a lot of people are turned off by that because of that very reason\""]
["11:05,420","11:10,700","\"Which is why I try not to recommend it to people because if I don't try to give it some to watch a little\""]
["11:10,700","11:13,940","\"Better chance to watch a little reverse psychology there. Yeah, yeah\""]
["11:13,940","11:17,820","\"That's the old Tomar trick. So you got married, right?\""]

["15:39,600","15:42,760","\"Is that so wrong? It's not\""]
["15:42,760","15:50,420","\"The problem is you're gonna have to fight off a whole bunch of other dudes man, I think within the next 30 years\""]

["16:47,700","16:52,980","\"Let me ask you Chris what could you get along?\""]
["16:52,980","16:58,860","\"Could you could you live without monies if I bought a bunch of shit first maybe?\""]

["17:13,500","17:20,180","\"My life plan is to buy property own it and then hopefully I'll be able to survive until I die\""]
["17:20,180","17:22,580","\"Nice\""]
["17:22,580","17:28,460","\"Property is a good thing to own as long as I have a computer to work on and ideas to do\""]
["17:28,460","17:32,420","\"It's just interesting to think about how much money you spend on rent\""]
["17:32,420","17:36,740","\"Yeah, if you're renting your whole life if you were to combine all that money\""]
["17:36,740","17:39,500","\"I wonder how close it gets to like a down payment on a house\""]
["17:39,500","17:45,200","\"Probably pretty fucking close pretty close. Yeah. No, eventually it would be enough to just buy house\""]
["17:45,200","17:51,200","\"Yeah, it's gotta be yeah, but the thing is you never had to deal with any of the liabilities of owning\""]
["17:51,200","17:57,020","\"That's true. Yep, and your pain taxes on property in some places your fucking tax on that property is more than rent\""]
["17:57,020","17:58,300","\"I was talking about it\""]
["17:58,300","18:05,400","\"I was just not really equity and like it is but if it's a house you're living in\""]
["18:06,180","18:11,420","\"It's it's not really worth anything to you until you're ready to leave yeah\""]
["18:11,420","18:20,500","\"Can you rent it out like an Airbnb? Yeah, but then you got either get out. That's the point. That's what like you you own\""]
["18:20,500","18:28,500","\"A house, but you only really make money the investment a good investment is a house that you can rent out. Yeah like\""]
["18:28,500","18:34,860","\"Like something that actually is actively making you money instead of costing you money. That's true\""]
["18:35,620","18:41,380","\"Why the the best thing you could do if you could do it would be to buy one or two\""]
["18:41,380","18:47,820","\"Extra houses and rent them out while you live in your well Chris. I suggest that your next big venture\""]
["18:47,820","18:52,180","\"I supports the idea that the rich get richer because yeah, only the rich people have the capital\""]
["18:52,180","18:58,180","\"Yeah, I think I think your next big venture if you if you ever come into a chunk of change\""]
["18:58,180","19:00,420","\"Yeah is to get like a nice\""]
["19:00,420","19:05,700","\"It's not it doesn't have to be a huge mansion, but a big house almost like the Philly house that the the one that we had\""]

["19:18,740","19:19,940","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["19:19,940","19:25,420","\"There would be like behind the bookcase if you like flip the the portrait or if you put the emblem the go man\""]

["20:02,860","20:06,100","\"or his sugar daddy Dumbledore\""]
["20:06,100","20:07,860","\"would fucking get him anything he wanted to.\""]
