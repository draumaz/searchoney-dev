["07:22,360","07:24,040","\"They was practically like a black man\""]
["07:24,040","07:26,200","\"But he was a fully white white man\""]
["07:26,200","07:28,540","\"But he had been in the sun so much that he looked like a black man\""]
["07:28,540","07:30,540","\"We were seeing that like super black model\""]
["07:30,540","07:33,860","\"That girl whose skin is it's not even brown. It's just black\""]
["07:33,860","07:36,580","\"No, it's weird\""]
["07:37,380","07:42,140","\"Kind of freaky I've never seen a girl so black before I found a picture of the world's blackest man once\""]
["07:42,140","07:45,140","\"Is that a thing you can look up? He was really black\""]
["07:45,140","07:49,460","\"Like his skin was like it's like almost yeah, it's almost blue at that point\""]
["07:49,460","07:55,780","\"God how cool would that be if they breed people to be so black they start turning blue and then there's blue people and then when people\""]
["07:55,780","07:58,700","\"Say blue lives matter. It's it's really for the same movement\""]
["07:58,700","08:02,460","\"Grrrr how cool to be if they bred black people\""]
