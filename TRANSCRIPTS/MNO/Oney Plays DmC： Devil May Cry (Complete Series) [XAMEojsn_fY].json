["06:24,700","06:30,620","\"Fine is actually pretty cool, but I couldn't tell you like what happened in one single level of five\""]
["06:30,620","06:32,620","\"I think people take a\""]
["06:32,620","06:35,060","\"Three story like too seriously\""]
["06:35,060","06:38,120","\"Three is a lot of fun. Well like the okay\""]
["06:38,120","06:41,680","\"So the big thing that separates this devil may cry from the other devil may cries\""]
["06:41,680","06:46,640","\"The other devil may cries are super like tongue-in-cheek like goofy no\""]
["06:46,640","06:52,760","\"No, three is like pure cheese, but I know people who are like I always cry at this part. It's like is really it's fucking stupid\""]
["06:52,760","06:57,440","\"Yeah, people cry it three. Yeah, what part of three do they cry?\""]
["06:57,440","07:03,600","\"Like Dante and Virgil running each other at the end when they're like you're my brother, but I gotta fight you\""]
["07:03,600","07:06,080","\"Why would that make you cry?\""]
["07:06,080","07:11,040","\"Like it's the part where they decide for the last time you know what? I don't really like you that much\""]
["07:11,040","07:14,920","\"I don't know. I have no idea. I'm sorry like it's just weird\""]
["07:14,920","07:19,240","\"Do you see that the bra was holding his guns up? I did\""]
["07:19,240","07:23,560","\"No escape. What's with this floor shit the text? Yeah?\""]
["07:23,560","07:26,520","\"Excuse me\""]

["07:33,240","07:37,480","\"Getting out of a trailer rent space for that pier must be a lot probably\""]
["07:37,480","07:41,940","\"I don't know if it got thrown onto the pier or what happens\""]
["07:41,940","07:49,960","\"Doesn't fucking matter this guy always called Evanie and I bring everything\""]
["07:52,600","07:58,880","\"That's so lame you have to say it out. Oh, yeah, cuz you got to know right this this is what you remember\""]
["07:58,880","08:02,280","\"It's a little different take a bath those crits\""]
["08:02,280","08:07,420","\"Looks in the camera. I guess everyone wants a part of Dante son of Sparta\""]
["08:07,420","08:12,920","\"It was a good job\""]
["08:12,920","08:17,440","\"Fuck you spiders, dude. I'm tired of them\""]
["08:20,600","08:22,600","\"No, you're a demon\""]
["08:22,600","08:25,240","\"You can tell by my perfect chest\""]
["08:25,240","08:35,000","\"It sounds pretty demony yeah, so in this game the demons and stuff are all in like a like an alternate reality\""]
["08:35,000","08:37,760","\"That you kind of ghost between I\""]
["08:37,760","08:44,400","\"See this game actually one thing I will give it is the levels in this game are super fun like the level designs\""]
["08:44,400","08:47,000","\"Are pretty cool?\""]
["08:47,000","08:50,940","\"And then Dante just comes in through him and he's like oh, I'm so epic in me\""]
["08:50,940","08:58,280","\"Not limbo I know how to get out. I just go as low as I can go\""]
["08:58,280","09:06,220","\"So it's not really his origin story like he's already been a demon hunter I guess\""]
["09:06,220","09:09,440","\"That's what every game is like though\""]
["09:09,440","09:13,200","\"Well, I mean that I'm just saying that's the impression\""]
["09:13,200","09:19,760","\"It's his job in the other ones. I think in this one is just like he goes here sometimes by accident\""]
["09:19,760","09:27,400","\"Sometimes I just want to kill some demons sometimes I just want to collect a little homunculus from the wall\""]
["09:27,400","09:30,700","\"I like the the enemy designs some of them are pretty cool\""]
["09:30,700","09:37,560","\"Yeah, there's things to like in this game and there's also just as much to not like which I think it's pretty cool\""]
["09:37,560","09:41,740","\"But come on get get on it. I like the role-body demons\""]
["09:42,480","09:45,400","\"I'm pretty sure I can smack them up into this. There we go. Yeah\""]

["10:08,800","10:14,640","\"Yeah, like the centrifugal force pushes you against it and you can just you pass it'll flow up your back\""]
["10:14,640","10:20,880","\"I haven't done that but I have I have stood up on the wall like sideways\""]
["10:20,880","10:27,200","\"You face inward yeah like with my head going through the middle\""]
["10:27,200","10:34,720","\"That's so stupid. You're not supposed to do that. Yeah, but I really wanted to because what other opportunity would I get?\""]
["10:34,720","10:37,120","\"Break your head off someone else's head\""]
["10:37,120","10:47,160","\"Just moving towards the music no no\""]

["12:06,160","12:12,920","\"You know what I mean? Yeah, I mean we're just lucky to have some end to it\""]
["12:12,920","12:18,360","\"You know in Ireland the news is always like really stoic and everyone's always like it was five men murder today\""]

["31:22,900","31:28,700","\"I'm not even the biggest devil may cry fam, but this is north. Yeah, so this is this is where you get like\""]
["31:28,700","31:32,500","\"They don't give you the the main mechanics of the game until this level\""]

["32:44,960","32:48,600","\"Yeah, so I have this now.\""]
["32:48,600","32:54,520","\"So the way that this game kind of works is like you hold like right trigger to use the\""]
["32:54,520","32:57,600","\"heavy weapons and then I'll eventually get a fast one.\""]
["32:57,600","32:58,600","\"That's cool.\""]
["32:58,600","33:01,880","\"And you can kind of switch like mid combo if I recall correctly.\""]

["37:43,700","37:51,740","\"She she just answers questions. She did she was probably the only one you'd think that just by virtue of being able to answer a question\""]

["38:58,700","39:01,860","\"organism properties\""]
["39:01,860","39:08,340","\"Like that's why syrups are preservative because shit like when something's got a shit ton of sugar and it's hard\""]
["39:08,340","39:13,860","\"It's a hard environment for bacteria to grow. Yeah, doesn't honey like straight up not expire?\""]
["39:15,140","39:21,520","\"Something like it is hard and it does eventually crystallize, but yeah, you can you can melt a pack down\""]
["39:21,520","39:29,260","\"I think I just did like a bonus shot. You were putting honey all over your balls. Nope and let it crystallize\""]

["40:07,620","40:14,700","\"Like the Jurassic Park mosquito. Yeah. Oh, so so she'd just be perfectly preserved and you could take your DNA and\""]
["40:14,700","40:17,780","\"Yeah, and then we you could have the movie Joan of Park where\""]
["40:17,780","40:23,420","\"Joan of Park that's not bad\""]
["40:23,420","40:29,100","\"Oh look at that a little goopy platform for you\""]
["40:29,100","40:36,200","\"Yeah, the red one you when you press the red button and then fire it pulls you towards\""]

["40:47,580","40:52,120","\"Like the base mechanics of this game are like really really solid\""]
["40:52,120","40:58,240","\"And I will actually stand by them as being pretty good. I will stand by how shitty and lame it is\""]
["40:58,240","41:04,640","\"I will stand by this stupid fucking game and it's done moronic system of combat and movement stop him\""]
