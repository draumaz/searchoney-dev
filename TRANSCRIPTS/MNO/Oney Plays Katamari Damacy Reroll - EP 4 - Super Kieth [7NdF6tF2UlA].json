["14:37,620","14:42,340","\"and then they're... you don't have 'em anymore. I just used the ol' \"\"feet 'em too much food,\"\"\""]

["14:54,580","14:55,740","\"- Can?\""]
["14:55,740","14:56,820","\"Or whirl on the floor.\""]

["14:58,540","15:00,420","\"One of the coolest things you can do for a kid\""]
["15:00,420","15:02,620","\"is like melt down a bunch of Skittles\""]
["15:02,620","15:05,380","\"into pure liquid and just throw it down to the mouth.\""]
["15:05,380","15:06,780","\"Yeah, that is pretty epic.\""]
["15:06,780","15:12,540","\"Or you just feel like a little concrete pool with it\""]
["15:12,540","15:15,060","\"and then be like, \"\"Hey, you like Terminator 2, right?\"\"\""]
["15:15,060","15:17,140","\"(laughs)\""]
["15:17,140","15:23,240","\"Give me a thumbs up son still weird to think that guy was our governor although I guess comparatively not really now\""]

["15:28,320","15:34,160","\"Wait, Lyle. He made some real changes. I think this is like an episode of black mirror Lyle, right?\""]
["15:34,160","15:41,280","\"Yeah, you get a computer and you have a simulation of the universe on it that was perfect recreation, right?\""]
["15:41,280","15:46,400","\"Yeah, do you feel bad about killing little little people with real consciousness?\""]
["15:46,400","15:50,240","\"But they're inside the computer. Um and depends on the person maybe\""]
["15:50,240","15:58,900","\"So you wouldn't kill the virtual person like what would you do if a big a big mouse came in the room to start slapping you around right now?\""]
["15:58,900","16:05,280","\"What I feel bad about killing the mouse no no I meant like a like a computer mouse oh\""]
["16:05,280","16:11,120","\"I'm saying in the simulation if I just started fucking with you it'd be funny right it'll be funny\""]
["16:11,120","16:16,380","\"But what did you feel bad for doing that cuz cuz all the consciousness is if they're actual things and\""]
["16:16,380","16:20,460","\"Yeah, maybe I mean I'd still do it, but I'd feel a little bit bad. I keep hearing\""]
["16:20,460","16:26,440","\"Right now that we're more than likely in a simulation. So what's the fucking difference? Yeah, that's true. Oh, yes\""]
["16:26,440","16:30,280","\"Oh, class Wow, you're killing everyone. I mean yeah\""]
["16:30,280","16:36,680","\"I could see some dickhead like sending a bunch of hurricanes at Florida like these people keep eating faces and fucking\""]
["16:36,680","16:39,580","\"doing shit\""]
["16:39,580","16:42,680","\"Get them. It's ridiculous. It'd be pretty funny\""]
["16:44,780","16:52,420","\"You know what black mirrors cool and all but I wouldn't mind seeing a white mirror episode. Mm-hmm. Yeah, mix it up\""]
["16:52,420","16:56,600","\"Instead of putting subconsciousness in computers\""]
["16:56,600","16:59,980","\"Computers in subconscious\""]
["16:59,980","17:12,100","\"This is why no one hires this right\""]
["17:12,100","17:14,100","\"I\""]
["17:14,100","17:19,180","\"Could I could come up with a good black mirror episode right now?\""]
["17:19,180","17:21,540","\"Okay, but in the future\""]
["17:21,540","17:25,420","\"Everyone's dickhole is cauterized shut as a child\""]
["17:25,420","17:32,540","\"And they just build up urine and become bloated urine people and then one day one of these boys\""]
["17:32,540","17:36,340","\"Falls and slits open his cauterized\""]
["17:36,780","17:42,460","\"Decal yeah, and peas naturally for the first time and realizes the government has been lying to him\""]
["17:42,460","17:44,660","\"Ooh\""]
["17:44,660","17:51,920","\"So it's terrible, but it's good. No, don't you understand? It's about society Chris. Where's the subconscious snooze?\""]
["17:51,920","17:57,400","\"Yeah, and then he goes oh, but oops. I'm in a computer and that's the\""]
["17:57,400","18:01,380","\"Okay, yeah, okay. There we go. I'm I'm down with that\""]
["18:01,380","18:04,660","\"You're pretty good at that. Yeah, I know you knew your shit\""]
["18:04,660","18:10,780","\"No.\""]
["18:10,780","18:14,780","\"My favorite thing about cows is how fucking stupid they are.\""]
["18:14,780","18:17,940","\"You can just run at them and scream in their face and they will die of fright.\""]
["18:17,940","18:19,180","\"Yeah, good point.\""]
["18:19,180","18:20,580","\"Is that true?\""]
["18:20,580","18:21,580","\"No.\""]
["18:21,580","18:24,420","\"It will die of fright.\""]
["18:24,420","18:25,420","\"It should be.\""]
["18:25,420","18:29,660","\"I have heard that cows, the only reason they're still alive is because we're eating\""]
["18:29,660","18:30,660","\"them.\""]
["18:30,660","18:32,380","\"Like they would have naturally died out.\""]

["18:33,380","18:34,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["18:34,380","18:38,180","\"They're kind of like dogs and shit. They're they're domesticated to a certain extent\""]

["18:42,620","18:46,540","\"I think are just they can only really exist as as\""]
["18:46,540","18:49,540","\"domestic things\""]
["18:49,540","18:54,700","\"Yeah, although I don't know if that's a hundred percent true either because if you ever like drive up like through the mountains and shit\""]
["18:54,700","18:59,660","\"You'll just see them on the fucking like side of the mountains. Yeah, that might just be the meat lobby fucking around yeah\""]
["19:00,780","19:07,860","\"It could be just a little urban legend a little like you know we're doing these cows favor by emptying their milk bladder thing\""]
["19:07,860","19:09,380","\"and\""]
["19:09,380","19:11,380","\"Eating them. Yeah\""]
["19:11,380","19:14,100","\"This game is pretty fucking amazing\""]
