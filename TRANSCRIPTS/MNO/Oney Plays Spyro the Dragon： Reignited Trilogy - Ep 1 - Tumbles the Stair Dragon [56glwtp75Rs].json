["10:19,800","10:24,160","\"I love that movie. I do think you get kind of silly with this one\""]
["10:24,160","10:31,360","\"There's a lot of face stabbing in that movie. I was really convinced that a Hugh Jackman was gonna be the first CGI\""]
["10:31,360","10:34,880","\"Guy in like the MCU for a while\""]
["10:34,880","10:42,960","\"Because it seemed like they were really like getting at that with the because the bad guy in that movie is a CGI like younger Hugh Jackman\""]
["10:42,960","10:44,960","\"Yeah, that's right\""]
["10:45,520","10:51,600","\"It looked pretty damn good too. They've done it with Arnold Schwarzenegger - and the the Terminator that they made while he was the governor\""]
