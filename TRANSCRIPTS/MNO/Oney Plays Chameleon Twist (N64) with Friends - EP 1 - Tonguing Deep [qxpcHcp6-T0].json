["00:08,400","00:12,120","\"Hello, welcome to Chameleon Twist with Lyle and DingDong.\""]
["00:12,120","00:15,200","\"I would like for you to hold me close-\""]
["00:15,200","00:17,760","\"Alright, be quiet. -specifically to your asshole.\""]
["00:17,760","00:20,540","\"And Jack is screaming at me with your asshole. -I were all best friends.\""]
["00:20,540","00:23,660","\"All of them look weird and balding. *Laughter*\""]
["00:23,660","00:25,100","\"Dude, it's tangled.\""]
["00:25,100","00:27,320","\"See, this is the weird thing.\""]
["00:27,320","00:30,680","\"This chameleon kind of sorta looks like a fucking chameleon.\""]
["00:30,680","00:39,880","\"Then this white rabbit motherfucker comes up and he accidentally makes him into like a chameleon person hybrid.\""]
["00:39,880","00:45,080","\"But then the chameleon person hybrid looks nothing like a fucking chameleon anymore.\""]
["00:45,080","00:48,280","\"It just looks like a green ball headed fucking thing.\""]
["00:48,280","00:51,880","\"They change how they look in the second game for America.\""]
["00:51,880","00:53,480","\"They make them actually look like chameleons.\""]
["00:53,480","00:54,680","\"But that was only for America.\""]
["00:54,680","00:56,680","\"Japan still has the ball heads, I don't know why.\""]
["00:56,680","01:03,600","\"Maybe too many Americans actually knew what chameleons looked like\""]
["01:03,600","01:10,380","\"Now look like that do they well they look kind of like that they look more like that than fucking ball heads\""]
["01:10,380","01:15,040","\"I know they have ball heads maybe if those dirty japs would fucking unsquent their eyes wait a minute\""]
["01:15,040","01:23,600","\"He's blown that whistle\""]
["01:23,600","01:26,120","\"Yeah, check it out\""]
["01:26,120","01:31,840","\"So I don't know what that is on the side of his head, but I always saw that as weird,\""]
["01:31,840","01:33,760","\"like balding hair.\""]
["01:33,760","01:38,440","\"Although maybe I'm interpreting that wrong because it's really all it is, it's a fucking\""]
["01:38,440","01:39,440","\"circle.\""]
["01:39,440","01:40,440","\"Yeah, I don't know.\""]
["01:40,440","01:43,680","\"I mean, to me, it felt like a sports uniform or something.\""]
["01:43,680","01:46,440","\"Yeah, you can do a few little, well, no, like on the side of his head.\""]
["01:46,440","01:47,440","\"Yeah, that's what I mean, the white spots.\""]
["01:47,440","01:49,080","\"It felt like a helmet or something.\""]
["01:49,080","01:50,080","\"Oh, right.\""]
["01:50,080","01:51,080","\"All like a wrestler?\""]
["01:51,080","01:52,080","\"Yeah, I don't know.\""]
["01:52,080","01:53,080","\"Or like a football club.\""]
["01:53,080","01:55,080","\"Like where holes would be on a football helmet.\""]
["01:55,080","01:56,080","\"I have no idea.\""]
["01:56,080","01:58,720","\"Look at my balls if you press Z. You can also\""]
["01:58,720","02:04,700","\"And do while moving you actually you get like momentum. Yeah, then you can like spring off of it\""]
["02:04,700","02:08,620","\"So do I actually and can you grab walls in this one?\""]
["02:08,620","02:14,160","\"Is that the seat? No, you can't grab walls you can grab sticks because in the sequel you can grab all so if you jump\""]
["02:14,160","02:18,180","\"When you hit like the peak of that you like slingshot yourself. Oh, that's cool\""]
["02:18,180","02:23,960","\"It's me the chameleon. It's game has already music - it's a fun little game dude\""]
["02:23,960","02:29,880","\"I have not seen this fucking game in years. I've never even heard of it. I used to run it all the time\""]
["02:29,880","02:34,640","\"I I owned it and I didn't really have that many games as a as a kid\""]
["02:34,640","02:37,440","\"and this is like one of the ones that I did have and\""]
["02:37,440","02:42,760","\"Yeah, this this is bringing back a bunch of weird fucking memories. Oh god\""]
["02:42,760","02:48,480","\"I mean it's a fun little idea and everything - oh yeah, I did this before and I don't think anything's really done after\""]
["02:48,480","02:53,680","\"Well, I mean it's a weird fucking idea in general it is\""]
["02:53,680","02:57,360","\"So if you lick those sticks and then I think you press A\""]
["02:57,360","03:01,200","\"It's something if you press something when you lick the sticks you can like swing around\""]
["03:01,200","03:05,920","\"Grab onto it and then I'm just getting these but I'm sorry\""]
["03:05,920","03:11,600","\"I like it. Yeah, this game is great\""]
["03:11,600","03:16,000","\"It's a little Harry Potter in the philosopher's stone, but uh pretty great\""]
["03:16,000","03:21,600","\"Check this out little bastards. Oh check this out. They'll dang it\""]
["03:22,400","03:26,560","\"You get fatter and slower as you pick up more dudes.\""]
["03:26,560","03:28,200","\"You get fatter and slower?\""]
["03:28,200","03:30,400","\"Yeah, see how you're fattin' slow and then spit 'em out?\""]
["03:30,400","03:32,760","\"If you just hold R, you can aim.\""]
["03:32,760","03:34,160","\"And uh...\""]
["03:34,160","03:36,160","\"Yeah, there's a way to spit out just one too.\""]
["03:36,160","03:37,760","\"Yeah, there's a way to spit out just one I forget how.\""]
["03:37,760","03:39,760","\"See, this game was 20 minutes long.\""]
["03:39,760","03:40,280","\"It's...\""]
["03:40,280","03:43,520","\"Well, maybe if you fucking speedrun it, not doing what you're doing.\""]
["03:43,520","03:46,000","\"If you know what you're doing, you can get through it really quick.\""]
["03:46,000","03:47,680","\"I could play the next level if you want.\""]
["03:47,680","03:48,280","\"I don't mind.\""]
["03:48,280","03:49,360","\"There's only like six stages.\""]
["03:49,360","03:51,680","\"Let's take turns, like, brothers.\""]
["03:51,680","03:54,280","\"It's a good idea. You haven't played this in too many years.\""]
["03:54,280","03:56,240","\"Oh yeah, I haven't played it in really long time.\""]
["03:56,240","03:58,000","\"You remember everything though.\""]
["03:58,000","04:01,440","\"I haven't played this in so many years, but I remember most of it.\""]
["04:01,440","04:04,240","\"I didn't have an emphasis.\""]
["04:04,240","04:06,240","\"You have PlayStation.\""]
["04:06,240","04:07,480","\"Well, well, there you go.\""]
["04:07,480","04:08,480","\"Yeah, judge that for a little.\""]
["04:08,480","04:12,080","\"Yeah, you just lose one health. That's cool.\""]
["04:12,080","04:13,480","\"This game's very...\""]
["04:13,480","04:15,520","\"It's not hard. There's a...\""]
["04:15,520","04:17,920","\"They're really generous about how...\""]
["04:17,920","04:21,640","\"I remember some of the bosses being a little more difficult.\""]
["04:21,640","04:25,640","\"I remember one of them is a little bit weird because you have the you're supposed to spin around and trip down\""]
["04:25,640","04:30,520","\"That's how you fuck them. I'm just I'm not used to the Nintendo 64 controller. Yeah, I mean\""]
["04:30,520","04:33,000","\"That's even the better one\""]
["04:33,000","04:37,160","\"Everyone have that friend that was like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna use the good controller\""]
["04:37,160","04:42,120","\"You use the shitty weird single prong fucking claw controller\""]
["04:42,120","04:46,520","\"I never had an N64 so this controller just feels really alien. It's it is yeah\""]
["04:46,520","04:49,160","\"It's made for like we baby hands\""]
["04:50,760","04:53,000","\"I like it, but it takes time to get used to it.\""]
["04:53,000","04:57,080","\"It's also people are weird about it because they're like, \"\"Why is there three?\"\"\""]
["04:57,080","05:01,640","\"It's supposed to be two controllers in one, so it's like a super Nintendo controller with six base buttons,\""]
["05:01,640","05:03,000","\"or it's an analog controller.\""]
["05:03,000","05:08,760","\"Or you have the Mongoloid friends who stretch their thumbs out across the whole thing.\""]
["05:08,760","05:13,800","\"There was fucking nothing that used the actual D-pad on this concept.\""]
["05:13,800","05:15,480","\"There's a couple games, but not many.\""]
["05:15,480","05:16,840","\"It's like Kirby.\""]
["05:16,840","05:20,040","\"I actually remember I was so fucking stupid as a kid.\""]
["05:20,040","05:25,740","\"I took a game back because it used the D-pad. I didn't realize it. I thought my controller was broken or the game was broken.\""]
["05:25,740","05:26,240","\"Really?\""]
["05:26,240","05:28,040","\"Yeah, it was Tetrisphere.\""]
["05:28,040","05:31,540","\"Tetrisphere uses the D-pad. If you use the analytics, nothing happens.\""]
["05:31,540","05:34,240","\"I thought the game was broken and I took it back because of that.\""]
["05:34,240","05:34,940","\"[chuckles]\""]
["05:34,940","05:38,540","\"I felt like such a fucking idiot. That game's really good too. That's a fun game.\""]
["05:38,540","05:39,540","\"You got a swing.\""]
["05:39,540","05:42,040","\"Yeah, you got to spin around if you want the crown.\""]
["05:42,040","05:43,040","\"Okay, baby.\""]
["05:43,040","05:44,740","\"Check this out.\""]
["05:44,740","05:45,740","\"Oops.\""]
["05:45,740","05:47,040","\"Oh, you blew it.\""]
["05:47,040","05:47,740","\"[chuckles]\""]
["05:47,740","05:48,940","\"You can use to it!\""]
["05:48,940","05:55,100","\"Thank you for insta-patient with me Chris fucking hurry up\""]
["05:55,100","05:58,820","\"Whoa\""]
["05:58,820","05:59,820","\"Why do that?\""]
["05:59,820","06:04,880","\"Because you chose the wrong way to spend you can choose a different way to spend I think if you hold the analytics take left or right\""]
["06:04,880","06:06,880","\"You can choose the way you want to go\""]
["06:06,880","06:09,980","\"There you go\""]
["06:09,980","06:13,380","\"That was easy. Did you see the game dudes review on this?\""]
["06:14,100","06:18,620","\"He says chameleon twist more like chameleon piss. He did not yeah\""]
["06:18,620","06:25,460","\"The game dude it's a classic with attitude I forget the theme song\""]
["06:25,460","06:30,720","\"Cory has a memorized of course he thinks he kept singing it\""]
["06:30,720","06:35,180","\"I feel bad for Aaron Aaron was just playing it. He's just trying to play overwatch and\""]
["06:35,180","06:38,520","\"Cory's just putting out all these game-dude videos\""]
["06:39,420","06:43,340","\"Also these guys just keep coming. Yeah, I think you can break their rocks\""]
["06:43,340","06:48,340","\"You can blow up their little homes. Oh fuck you guys as long as they have nowhere to live then they can't prosper\""]
["06:48,340","06:55,220","\"You can keep them down. It's an allegory for our race relations in America. Yeah, I can relate\""]
["06:55,220","07:02,220","\"I think they made levels easier for America to win this game really. Yeah, there's different layouts. Eat that\""]
["07:02,220","07:05,180","\"What did you play the Japanese version?\""]
["07:05,180","07:09,060","\"I found this out years later that we got a completely different game\""]
["07:09,060","07:12,940","\"Like it functions the same way it looks the same in everything\""]
["07:12,940","07:17,880","\"But the Japanese one the levels are much more complex and top of that\""]
["07:17,880","07:23,460","\"There's a lot of stuff you can unlock in the Japanese one like their secret characters see extra stuff as much as I played\""]
["07:23,460","07:24,900","\"This game as a kid\""]
["07:24,900","07:32,300","\"It was like this weird fever dream that my mind completely wiped until you brought it in the fucking room like ten minutes ago\""]
["07:32,860","07:36,160","\"And I like that a lot as a kid yeah me too\""]
["07:36,160","07:43,740","\"But it's it's weird because I have I'm so disconnected from what I'm seeing and I know I've played it like a thousand times\""]
["07:43,740","07:46,540","\"Oh, I'm gonna die here. I don't know\""]
["07:46,540","07:53,500","\"I'm just gonna die. No, I'm cool. I got this analog stick\""]
["07:53,500","07:58,800","\"I like it, but it takes a lot of extra force to push it\""]
["08:00,300","08:05,720","\"That's part of why I like it though is that compared to other analytics because you kind of get a feel where you're holding it\""]
["08:05,720","08:07,880","\"You can jump and do it. Yeah\""]
["08:07,880","08:14,840","\"What do you want to do is have it out and then jump while doing it? Yeah, you can do that. It's crazy. There you go\""]
["08:14,840","08:20,180","\"All right, you got rock boy genius over here. I don't like these\""]
["08:20,180","08:25,500","\"You got the heart you can eat the heart too. It's bit the spiders at them. I\""]
["08:25,500","08:27,940","\"Want to kill them\""]
["08:27,940","08:32,860","\"They're holding you're gonna have to look you it's them or you look you\""]
["08:32,860","08:39,420","\"They're killing me all it takes to murder a golem is a high velocity spider\""]
["08:39,420","08:44,620","\"Keep that in mind kids for all the practical applications of it in real life\""]
["08:44,620","08:49,300","\"Oh wow, it was one hit each sense. This has been life tips on only plays. Yeah\""]
["08:51,620","08:56,620","\"Lyle yeah, this game is for babies. Yeah, dude. What's this shim?\""]
["08:56,620","09:00,780","\"Apple sauce just run through it fuck ignore everything happening around you\""]
["09:00,780","09:05,140","\"They just wanted to show you that they were doing that. I don't know what the point of that room is\""]
["09:05,140","09:11,740","\"That was weird. Yeah, they were just like look there's a fucking tumbler around lava. It's good right. There's a tumbler\""]
["09:11,740","09:15,740","\"Uh-huh\""]
["09:15,740","09:18,340","\"Final Fantasy 7 Donkey Kong\""]
["09:18,340","09:20,480","\"My god\""]
["09:20,480","09:24,600","\"Yeah, push him in the hole. Oh really? Yeah, it's fucking horrifying. I don't like it\""]
["09:24,600","09:28,680","\"My name is Chris and I'm scared of monkeys in my hole\""]
["09:28,680","09:34,960","\"I'm I gotta push him down the hole. Yeah when he's beating his chest. That's what he's vulnerable. There you go\""]
["09:34,960","09:41,800","\"You\""]
["09:41,800","09:48,800","\"Yeah, and and he's legitimately fell to his death there. Well, what monkey don't?\""]
["09:48,800","09:52,500","\"You get to watch him die.\""]
["09:52,500","09:54,160","\"Oh come on.\""]
["09:54,160","09:56,760","\"Kick him out while he's down.\""]
["09:56,760","09:58,560","\"I killed the fucking monkey!\""]
["09:58,560","10:00,800","\"(beeping)\""]
