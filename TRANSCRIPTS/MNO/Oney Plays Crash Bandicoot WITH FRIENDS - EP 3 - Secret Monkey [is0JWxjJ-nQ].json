["05:30,880","05:33,080","\"It's like, \"\"You're griefing. Who fucking cares?\"\"\""]
["05:33,080","05:35,680","\"Go play on someone else's server, is that's how you feel?\""]
["05:36,240","05:41,300","\"Did they come in and they murder bone and they kill everybody and then I picked them up and I throw them out at the space\""]
["05:41,300","05:48,980","\"Also, if you're gonna act more professional what that means in regards to other servers is oh, I'm gonna ban you over any little\""]
["05:48,980","05:50,980","\"Yeah, fuck that\""]
["05:50,980","05:52,240","\"Exactly\""]
["05:52,240","05:56,160","\"Just want to complain it wasn't like that when it first started\""]
["05:56,160","06:03,620","\"Edmonds were not like that on any server. You could just do we don't ban people unless they're constantly like fucking around and\""]
["06:03,620","06:05,220","\"I mean that was ruining people's games.\""]
["06:05,220","06:08,900","\"The thing with the game way back was that it was just left to what it was.\""]
["06:08,900","06:10,340","\"People could do whatever the fuck they wanted.\""]
["06:10,340","06:13,940","\"We wanted our server to be more like chilled out because every other server bans you for\""]

["06:28,580","06:32,980","\"No, go to fault station and learn the game and join our server.\""]
["06:32,980","06:38,900","\"And we'll have a fun old time. Oh you will. You will. GAY old time. But if you grief don't expect to be-\""]
["06:38,900","06:48,200","\"Oh this looks bad. I don't like this. Remember me, my name is Marge, the TV mom whose hair is large. I am Marge himself!\""]
["06:48,200","07:00,460","\"Marge! Marge! Marge! I love you all! I may be fucking up quite a bit here. What's funnier kukamanga or Walla Walla Washington?\""]

["07:36,940","07:41,260","\"Wow, look at how they're distorting the ground to make it look like it's rippling.\""]
["07:41,260","07:47,420","\"Is that how they're doing it? Yeah. That's a good idea. Oh, they're just manually wobbling it.\""]
["07:47,420","07:51,500","\"There's more to this fight than there was in the second game. Yeah,\""]
["07:51,500","07:57,980","\"you said to be in the right spot. You have to see you hear your employing strategy.\""]
["07:58,780","08:01,500","\"I like the tiny, the tiny fight though too.\""]
["08:01,500","08:03,340","\"Tiny fight?\""]

["08:05,020","08:06,620","\"Tiny toige.\""]
["08:06,620","08:10,700","\"I think I think it's a better fight than his fight in the third game.\""]
["08:10,700","08:15,420","\"Why is he the only one themed after time travel as a boss?\""]
["08:15,420","08:16,380","\"Ooh.\""]
["08:16,380","08:17,340","\"Yeah, tiny.\""]
["08:17,340","08:19,180","\"He's dressed up as a gladiator.\""]
["08:19,180","08:20,700","\"No one else is themed in any way.\""]
["08:20,700","08:21,420","\"And trophy?\""]
["08:21,420","08:23,100","\"That's him.\""]
["08:23,100","08:24,220","\"That's just how he is.\""]
["08:24,220","08:26,460","\"No, you go from time period to time period.\""]
["08:26,460","08:27,820","\"Oh yeah, he was wearing night's armor.\""]
["08:27,820","08:30,280","\"No the backdrop oh\""]
["08:30,280","08:34,860","\"This level is cool. I love this level. I'm saying him as a character like\""]
["08:34,860","08:38,020","\"Tiny's the only one oh worrying something\""]
["08:38,020","08:44,880","\"Because dingo dials just dingo dial. Yeah, he's not anywhere. He's in the polar ice caps or some shit\""]
["08:44,880","08:50,380","\"Yeah, what does that have to do? I think it's supposed to be the ice age is that what it is doesn't come off that way\""]
["08:50,380","08:55,340","\"It doesn't come off that way like how the motorcycle doesn't come on yeah, cuz they don't have like mammoth tests coming out of the ice\""]
["08:55,820","08:58,640","\"- The platforming stages are just really, really plain\""]
["08:58,640","08:59,720","\"and it's stupid bat.\""]
["08:59,720","09:01,920","\"They're not very challenging.\""]
["09:01,920","09:03,520","\"The time trials are at least fun.\""]
["09:03,520","09:05,300","\"Like I like the idea of that,\""]
["09:05,300","09:09,000","\"but there's no point of doing them until you get the dash move,\""]
["09:09,000","09:10,640","\"not dash running like this.\""]
["09:10,640","09:12,780","\"- Oh no! - God dang it.\""]
["09:12,780","09:14,200","\"- That's a big hit box I have.\""]
["09:14,200","09:16,720","\"- If I could crouch it would have helped.\""]
["09:16,720","09:19,300","\"- What if Brad Bird had a bird in his pocket\""]
["09:19,300","09:20,140","\"and he called it Brad?\""]
["09:20,140","09:21,920","\"- What if everyone decided to hit Brad Bird\""]

["09:35,080","09:37,520","\"I don't think it's like amazing or anything, but I thought it was like-\""]
["09:37,520","09:39,280","\"What the fuck was that?\""]
["09:39,280","09:40,600","\"I thought it was an okay movie.\""]
