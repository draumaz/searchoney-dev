["04:56,420","05:01,820","\"How many would you like I want to own 1% of visually stock? That's all\""]
["05:03,300","05:09,820","\"This system is a copy of one created by a corporation called N.com the original program was destroyed\""]
["05:09,820","05:14,660","\"It feels so bad for this little little data man\""]

["05:17,940","05:26,060","\"Oh shut up he's supposed to be a security program, right?\""]
["05:26,060","05:29,820","\"Do you want to use hollow bastion OS over windows?\""]
["05:31,100","05:38,180","\"Not really try I would try it maybe maybe once you get used to it. It's not that bad. You know what maybe you're right\""]
["05:38,180","05:45,620","\"Good idea looking you play on it\""]
["05:45,620","05:49,380","\"Flash\""]
["05:49,380","05:50,740","\"I\""]
["05:50,740","05:53,940","\"Remember Kingdom Hearts - specifically this is this this\""]
["05:54,980","05:59,700","\"I remember feeling so clever for just putting it into the disk tray of my computer\""]
["05:59,700","06:05,660","\"And then it warns you and says it's going to delete everything you could get you could get one video off of it\""]
["06:05,660","06:07,660","\"Which is the the big cutscene\""]
["06:07,660","06:11,660","\"Really for the middle point and it didn't have any sound on it\""]
["06:11,660","06:19,060","\"Like any Easter eggs or anything. Oh some games do it\""]
["06:19,060","06:22,300","\"What's a good example?\""]
["06:23,060","06:29,480","\"Shenmue on the Dreamcast every single disc if you put it into a CD player you have one of the characters talk to you telling you to get it out\""]
["06:29,480","06:31,480","\"Really? That's fine.\""]
["06:31,480","06:33,680","\"Like it's like an audio file or what?\""]
["06:33,680","06:38,120","\"Yeah, it plays up the it's the first track in the disc. It's cool\""]
["06:38,120","06:45,340","\"They tried to scare you with those the Sega CD you had one where it had like this weird\""]
["06:45,340","06:51,280","\"guitar riff playing in the back with a woman saying warning if you keep playing this disc on an audio system\""]
["06:51,280","06:56,220","\"It may damage your hardware. It's not true. It's not gonna do it\""]
["06:56,220","06:59,660","\"Isn't that the one where it would have like the alarm sound on it?\""]
["06:59,660","07:01,900","\"Well, that they told you something about that.\""]
["07:01,900","07:07,980","\"Yeah, it's because there's a guitar in the back and it's making like these horrifying noises and it's like it's actually already doing damage or something\""]
["07:07,980","07:15,780","\"It would scare kids Julian. I made you not want to do it. Is there a Tron version of every weapon in the game? Yeah, that's amazing\""]
["07:16,980","07:24,100","\"I'm surprised they did that. I'm happy. I like that they like the drive forms like they whenever there's an art style shift\""]
["07:24,100","07:29,540","\"Like when you if you use\""]
["07:29,540","07:33,980","\"I forgot what it's even called because I never use them the magic one\""]
["07:33,980","07:38,100","\"Halloween town you get a little black mage masters\""]
["07:42,340","07:48,620","\"Ding dong why did they use jpeg for his grid why not just use regular grid?\""]
["07:48,620","07:53,500","\"I don't know what you mean\""]
["07:53,500","07:56,140","\"I could sort of see pixels\""]
["07:56,140","08:01,800","\"Because it's a ps2 game and the textures aren't gonna be the high quality dick is cold\""]
["08:01,800","08:08,420","\"I'm sorry. I didn't fucking notice. I was resting my drink on my cock the whole time\""]
["08:08,780","08:12,780","\"It's also a lot of lighting in this is just baked on anyways with the textures\""]
["08:12,780","08:18,340","\"Bike you mister. I'll bake you right right right in the head. Why are you gonna do that please?\""]
["08:18,340","08:24,720","\"I just wanted to play Kingdom Hearts. I just think maybe you could use a little color as all all colorization\""]
["08:24,720","08:25,900","\"Yeah\""]
["08:25,900","08:31,960","\"What's in this cyber chest a cyber pit cell area math? I don't want to play the bike game\""]
["08:31,960","08:32,820","\"I\""]
["08:32,820","08:36,580","\"Had a game on my laptop all through college that was the bike game from Toronto was fun\""]

["10:37,980","10:47,420","\"That's not what this is for actually all maybe if you saw the movie Tron you would know that maybe I don't want to watch a boring old Disney film\""]
["10:47,420","10:50,500","\"Everything of that\""]
["10:50,500","10:56,700","\"What if I told you there was a boring new Disney film based on the same property with Jeff Bridges CGI?\""]
["10:56,700","10:58,780","\"I never actually saw it me neither\""]
["10:58,780","11:04,900","\"But I remember when it came out everyone kept playing the soundtrack and it was driving me cuckoo\""]
["11:04,900","11:13,300","\"I actually really like how this looks right now. That's just because it's blight bloom and you are easily impressed as your is your planet full of\""]

["11:25,400","11:29,660","\"Trying to say your race is foul. Okay\""]
["11:29,660","11:37,300","\"You know, it's funny if aliens came down from space and there were big goo monsters and we were literally making fun of their race\""]
["11:37,300","11:39,300","\"No one would think it was racism\""]
["11:39,300","11:46,420","\"It's true people just be like they are kind of grown that's that's one of my irrational fears is that there would be\""]
["11:46,860","11:53,500","\"There would be alien contact yeah or some shit like ghosts or something yeah, and then like human\""]
["11:53,500","12:00,100","\"Human racism would end but it would then it would just turn into like a monster monster racism. Yeah\""]
["12:00,100","12:07,320","\"Do you guys like men in black you just introduce another thing then if people are being racist against ghosts you introduce an alien\""]

["14:19,700","14:26,460","\"look for the film. If I remember correctly, it was designed by an idiot. The guy.\""]
["14:26,460","14:29,460","\"Tron was a gigantic accident. Maybe you would feel that way because you don't even\""]
["14:29,460","14:33,300","\"You don't even like the concept to begin with, but uh, yeah, I mean, I don't think it's bad.\""]
["14:33,300","14:34,300","\"I just I'm starting to do it.\""]
["14:34,300","14:38,140","\"It was like more like gladiatorial like big muscle dudes.\""]

["18:14,940","18:18,460","\"That's bad. That's bad\""]
["18:18,460","18:22,900","\"I feel like they could have done it right all you have to do is rotate it so that they're always facing the camera\""]
["18:22,900","18:28,380","\"Like isn't that a really basic thing you could code? I'm like it's not basic, but you could do it for sure\""]

["18:38,340","18:43,520","\"This is a little character appear in front of me. That's probably what I would say is it because they're not the music\""]
["18:43,520","18:47,060","\"Their ears on the hood is that why they didn't bother with it\""]
["18:47,060","18:51,420","\"They still could have just like hit like, you know, it and his ears\""]
["18:51,420","18:54,380","\"when the hood's on\""]

["19:44,700","19:53,940","\"So I have questions and they need to be answered. Let's see. Can I use it already? No, no\""]
["19:53,940","20:00,740","\"Party select the party option. I guess so I don't remember how you level up. There's a master ball\""]
["20:02,700","20:08,580","\"Step in that save Tifa leave trade Tifa for Leon\""]
["20:08,580","20:16,220","\"Do you think Tifa would be my girl no, okay, she has cloud\""]
