["00:05,860","00:07,220","\"Look at this game.\""]
["00:07,220","00:08,300","\"This is Beam.\""]
["00:08,300","00:09,100","\"Is this real?\""]
["00:09,100","00:10,100","\"Beam Newgrounds Drive.\""]

["00:14,660","00:17,620","\"I can't wait till we get to the point where we can import Google Maps\""]
["00:17,620","00:20,180","\"for level design.\""]
["00:20,180","00:21,380","\"Maybe I should kind of need--\""]
["00:21,380","00:23,660","\"You want to do--\""]
["00:23,660","00:25,100","\"this is shit.\""]

["00:29,060","00:29,560","\"Love it.\""]
["00:29,560","00:36,360","\"Have you played this before cross very very briefly pizza delivery you got to do pizza delivery Chris. Where's that?\""]
["00:36,360","00:38,360","\"This is the top middle one\""]
["00:38,360","00:44,280","\"This is a homage to your first job. You know there's oni and g have you heard of beam and g?\""]
["00:44,280","00:47,280","\"That's my light base brother. Yeah\""]
["00:47,280","00:55,560","\"Look a fucking lot. This is like the Sims. I'm offended. Do not offend from when the sim said all that bullshit at the bottom like\""]
["00:55,560","00:57,880","\"articulating splines. Yeah\""]
["00:58,320","01:03,700","\"Giving sims remember their tongues. I've heard rumors that you can speak simones\""]
["01:03,700","01:16,200","\"Why does everyone sound like a horny mentally challenging person\""]
["01:16,200","01:25,640","\"Well, we can make fun of a made-up language without being accused of being racist. Yeah, okay\""]
["01:25,640","01:29,400","\"We're gonna take advantage of it. Fuck is going on here. What is happening to your screen?\""]
["01:29,400","01:33,280","\"Whoa what in the world what the fuck nice car?\""]
["01:33,280","01:39,080","\"This is me this street goes through your car. What's wrote the graphics? What is happening?\""]
["01:39,080","01:45,880","\"The crash is there sound I thought I heard a little sound. What in the fuck?\""]
["01:45,880","01:50,680","\"Let me do alright now. We're in haha. Oh, it gets his your name on the little only\""]
["01:50,680","01:53,540","\"That's so cute. Look at this\""]
["01:53,540","01:57,820","\"See he's got like real good physics.\""]
["01:57,820","01:59,540","\"Yeah, that looks great.\""]
["01:59,540","02:01,540","\"Yeah, but now let's see.\""]
["02:01,540","02:02,620","\"Let's see what this mission is.\""]
["02:02,620","02:03,600","\"Just how you really drive.\""]
["02:03,600","02:04,420","\"Deliver pizza.\""]
["02:04,420","02:06,020","\"You got to deliver the pizza.\""]
["02:06,020","02:06,840","\"Deliver the pizza.\""]
["02:06,840","02:10,180","\"Wait, is there really no pizza that's just like a waypoint?\""]
["02:10,180","02:11,860","\"It just kind of tells you which way to go.\""]
["02:11,860","02:15,060","\"This is going to make you drive down this narrow alley already.\""]
["02:15,060","02:16,100","\"Go!\""]
["02:16,100","02:18,340","\"OK, let's give this a go.\""]
["02:18,340","02:20,260","\"I like the car sound.\""]
["02:20,260","02:22,260","\"Yeah, so.\""]
["02:22,260","02:23,060","\"So I'm supposed to--\""]
["02:23,060","02:26,100","\"Sounds like one of the developers just did into a microphone.\""]
["02:26,100","02:27,820","\"Oh, get in.\""]
["02:27,820","02:29,500","\"Oh, you've done.\""]
["02:29,500","02:31,260","\"I just Austin Powers myself.\""]
["02:31,260","02:33,340","\"Fuck.\""]
["02:33,340","02:34,700","\"Here I got some.\""]
["02:34,700","02:35,540","\"All right.\""]
["02:35,540","02:37,340","\"The most ones you deliver are going to be.\""]
["02:37,340","02:40,340","\"The pizza is getting cold.\""]
["02:40,340","02:43,980","\"Why would you fucking drive around in this to deliver pizzas?\""]
["02:43,980","02:45,460","\"Why not a moped?\""]
["02:45,460","02:48,420","\"Is this supposed to be Europe or San Francisco?\""]
["02:48,420","02:50,420","\"It looks just like Europe.\""]
["02:50,420","02:52,780","\"Looks like all of your.\""]
["02:52,780","02:58,780","\"Yeah, this isn't San Francisco. Yeah, it's not. It's just Christ. It's not. Stop.\""]
["02:58,780","03:00,780","\"Stop. Fail. It failed.\""]
["03:00,780","03:04,780","\"Stop? What? Why did it? Wait, what happened? Who would have failed me for that?\""]
["03:04,780","03:08,780","\"What happened? What caused you to reverse? Yeah, exactly. I don't know. It's stupid.\""]
["03:08,780","03:14,780","\"I guess in real life, if you were in the middle of an intersection, I feel like you're going to kind of fail in life.\""]
["03:14,780","03:21,780","\"I guess I would have just like, if I saw a man drive up to me with a pizza and just drove one meter past me, I would just run back inside.\""]
["03:21,780","03:23,780","\"I can't call the order.\""]
["03:23,780","03:29,300","\"He'd run up to you with the pizza and you slap it out of his hand. No stop stop\""]
["03:29,300","03:34,180","\"Grazia. I guess it's supposed to be somewhere in Italy. Okay\""]
["03:34,180","03:39,700","\"Wow, that's not racist at all only people in Italy pizza, please\""]
["03:39,700","03:43,100","\"That is fucked up to even assume such please\""]
["03:43,100","03:50,220","\"Look at this. I'm actually really good. See see oh nice drift see see oh see you it's better\""]
["03:50,220","03:52,220","\"Can you populate this town with people?\""]
["03:52,220","03:58,980","\"That would be nice, but I don't think so look I'm or other cars wait. Why are you is this the apocalypse?\""]
["03:58,980","04:04,840","\"Like no people no cars. Nobody's in the business and it's broad daylight\""]
["04:04,840","04:08,260","\"It is broad daylight. I don't even want to finish this boring mission\""]
["04:15,740","04:17,420","\"- Fucking destroy it.\""]
["04:17,420","04:19,740","\"- Is there like a demolition derby mode?\""]
["04:19,740","04:21,100","\"- Let's try a better scenario.\""]
["04:21,100","04:22,580","\"- It's like my face when I shove it\""]
["04:22,580","04:23,740","\"into the corner of a desk.\""]
["04:23,740","04:25,660","\"We got Canyon, you wanna do Canyon jump?\""]
["04:25,660","04:27,260","\"- Sure. - Yeah.\""]
["04:27,260","04:28,100","\"- Sounds pretty cool.\""]
["04:28,100","04:30,500","\"- You might as well just make a Canyon jump pizza delivery\""]
["04:30,500","04:32,500","\"'cause like all it is is you driving\""]
["04:32,500","04:33,860","\"from one point to another.\""]
["04:33,860","04:34,700","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:34,700","04:36,020","\"Oh wait, there's the controllers.\""]
["04:36,020","04:39,980","\"Reset physics, throttle, page up, break.\""]
["04:39,980","04:41,180","\"Does that say page down?\""]
["04:41,180","04:42,940","\"- What?\""]
["04:42,940","04:44,580","\"- Oh no, says arrow up.\""]
["04:44,580","04:45,840","\"Can you change gravity?\""]
["04:45,840","04:47,660","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:47,660","04:48,500","\"Maybe, I don't know.\""]
["04:48,500","04:49,940","\"- I want you to fly to the moon.\""]
["04:49,940","04:50,860","\"- We can try it.\""]
["04:50,860","04:52,900","\"That would be the best simulator.\""]
["04:52,900","04:54,860","\"I know there's some weird options you could fuck with.\""]
["04:54,860","04:56,060","\"There might be gravity in there.\""]
["04:56,060","04:57,380","\"- Wouldn't that be a fun simulator\""]
["04:57,380","04:59,500","\"where you're on earth and there's a ramp,\""]
["04:59,500","05:01,660","\"but you gotta hit it at the right angle and speed\""]
["05:01,660","05:04,300","\"in order to reject yourself into the moon?\""]
["05:04,300","05:06,340","\"- Yeah, that would be a fucking awesome game.\""]
["05:06,340","05:08,660","\"- But you gotta take it into gravitational pull\""]
["05:08,660","05:11,260","\"and certain things, go.\""]
["05:11,260","05:13,900","\"Like a slight gravitational, go for that ramp.\""]
["05:13,900","05:22,100","\"the ramp oh fuck is it oh it's a really rocky the tire deflated you got this\""]
["05:22,100","05:26,140","\"you got this yeah I think you can still do it comes\""]
["05:26,140","05:34,660","\"is this slum or is this real time okay sorry oh no you did not survive this\""]
["05:34,660","05:40,260","\"Chris oh it's so fucking cool looking I love those physics okay we're we got\""]
["05:40,260","05:43,260","\"This is it. Oh, that's it Chris. Holy shit. This is it\""]
["05:43,260","05:57,700","\"Man there's a baby on board. There's nobody driving that. There's a little tiny toddler stepping on the\""]
["05:57,700","06:09,580","\"Running left it right really quick. No, I'm at on the fucking yeah, the pedals. No check this time\""]
["06:09,580","06:14,440","\"You got this that angle shift when you go up the ramp is all fucked up. This is it. This is it. You got this Chris\""]
["06:14,440","06:16,540","\"Oh, yeah, it is good. Hey, let's go straight\""]
["06:16,540","06:32,020","\"Guess try to do a loop the harder they try to go further back the higher they launch the harder they fall\""]
["06:32,020","06:37,700","\"Exactly young man. Yeah, how do you get that full? Yeah? Do some donuts?\""]
["06:37,700","06:40,100","\"Oh look at this. Oh there you go. This is your ramp\""]
["06:40,100","06:45,320","\"But just watch out cuz when you hit those rocks at this speed Chris you don't even know man\""]
["06:45,320","06:49,040","\"I'm just saying like I'm an expert driver and I'm like in in like movies and shit Chris\""]
["06:49,040","06:51,040","\"Can we do this is feel like\""]
["06:51,040","07:01,660","\"I couldn't fuck that I'm doing it dance you can still live. Oh\""]
["07:01,660","07:04,700","\"engine broken oh\""]
["07:06,220","07:08,220","\"Keep going go go go fuck. Oh\""]
["07:08,220","07:13,340","\"We'll down oh wait, I can still turn it wait\""]
["07:13,340","07:19,100","\"Control well the engines dead, but he can still the shish the the steering stories\""]
["07:19,100","07:24,820","\"Hey, Chris you failed. I'm sorry. Let's try one more time. Do you want to have a go get some speed?\""]
["07:24,820","07:30,940","\"No, dude. I don't know those controls look way too complicated. It's just up down left right. Oh fuck like I said\""]
["07:30,940","07:33,440","\"Those controls are way too complicated. Goodbye\""]
["07:35,180","07:38,540","\"Okay, okay, okay, sorry. I need it slow and steady wins the race\""]
["07:38,540","07:42,460","\"Yeah, you know you're so back up well technically no, or you do need some speed\""]
["07:42,460","07:47,820","\"But it's that old ancient proverb yes tortoise win the race, you know\""]
["07:47,820","07:53,560","\"Did you hear a shad was telling me the other version of that story really German version? There's a German version?\""]
["07:53,560","07:55,640","\"Yeah, it's the the hair and the hedgehog\""]
["07:55,640","07:58,100","\"This is real really yeah\""]
["07:58,100","08:03,780","\"So apparently you know how like slow and steady wins the race the story of the tours in the hair\""]
["08:03,780","08:07,980","\"It's about yes, you got it go hold on. Yes Chris\""]
["08:07,980","08:20,760","\"You know if if you were in the privacy you might have been launched through the windshield and survived that Jesus\""]
["08:20,760","08:26,940","\"So the story goes fuck this thing story goes in in the in the hair and the hedgehog\""]
["08:26,940","08:28,860","\"Yeah\""]
["08:28,860","08:34,140","\"There's a hair and he's he wears a monocle and he's a real condescending rich asshole\""]
["08:34,140","08:40,300","\"Hmm and the hedgehog is this very common kind of like farmer type blue collar person\""]
["08:40,300","08:46,200","\"Yeah, and he's married to another hedgehog who apparently looks identical to him because I guess that's something yeah\""]
["08:46,200","08:53,220","\"Anyways, so he keeps he keeps telling the hair like the hair is like oh I'm so much better than you you fucking suck\""]
["08:53,220","08:54,380","\"You're a hedgehog\""]
["08:54,380","08:57,840","\"However, the hedgehog's like, \"\"Cool, man. How about we race?\"\"\""]
["08:57,840","08:59,380","\"And the hare's like, \"\"Yeah, you got it.\"\"\""]
["08:59,380","09:03,080","\"But then he keeps having his wife go to the finish line.\""]
["09:03,080","09:06,580","\"So then every time the hare approaches the finish line,\""]
["09:06,580","09:10,580","\"he tries to go faster and faster, but he obviously can't catch up.\""]
["09:10,580","09:15,280","\"So they keep racing and he keeps wanting a do-over until finally he kills himself.\""]
["09:15,280","09:19,680","\"That's the end of the story. And then the two dance on his grave.\""]
["09:19,680","09:21,180","\"Literally dance on his grave.\""]
["09:21,180","09:23,180","\"That sounds way more fun on us.\""]
["09:23,180","09:27,420","\"The entire time the Hedgehog is just like psychologically hurting it.\""]
["09:27,420","09:28,420","\"Like fucking out.\""]
["09:28,420","09:29,420","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:29,420","09:35,020","\"But like the whole, I guess the point was if you are rich and you are powerful, do not\""]
["09:35,020","09:39,900","\"look down on the peasants because they can be smart too.\""]
["09:39,900","09:40,900","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:40,900","09:41,900","\"That's the story.\""]
["09:41,900","09:44,940","\"But I love how it's the complete opposite of the tortoise and the hare, which was about\""]
["09:44,940","09:49,820","\"working hard, keeping your nose down, just you know, keep drive and keep going, you know.\""]
["09:49,820","09:53,140","\"See, I feel like this narcissist character, the hair,\""]
["09:53,140","09:56,820","\"like one of the first things he do is assume that he was getting played\""]
["09:56,820","09:58,380","\"if he was losing to this guy.\""]
["09:58,380","09:59,060","\"Oh my god.\""]
["09:59,060","09:59,820","\"And he's playing.\""]
["09:59,820","10:05,220","\"And he'd hire a PI who would very quickly discover the whole, like, wife plot thing.\""]
["10:05,220","10:05,820","\"No!\""]
["10:05,820","10:06,420","\"And then he'd like--\""]
["10:06,420","10:07,020","\"Take him to court.\""]
["10:07,020","10:08,020","\"He'd attempt to marry someone.\""]
["10:08,020","10:09,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:09,020","10:13,420","\"And then the hedgehog would have no way of paying for this protracted court case.\""]
["10:13,420","10:15,820","\"And the hedgehog's life would still be ruined.\""]
["10:15,820","10:18,620","\"That's unfortunately more like how reality works.\""]
["10:18,620","10:19,620","\"It's true.\""]
["10:19,620","10:23,540","\"It is true. You'll make I'm the cop and you're the guy and you just\""]
["10:23,540","10:25,540","\"So many people\""]
["10:25,540","10:33,920","\"Mix characters driving to a\""]
["10:33,920","10:37,660","\"He's announced like\""]
["10:37,660","10:42,020","\"Like he wrote a letter to the police station. I'm driving to a\""]
["10:42,020","10:50,500","\"You can't stop me stop me. That's the stupid. I can't stop myself. This is horrible to control. This is it hurts\""]
["10:51,340","10:55,020","\"It's code 331 look at that. What are you doing Chris?\""]
["10:55,020","10:56,960","\"I'm gonna show you how it's done. It's not interesting\""]
["10:56,960","11:03,240","\"You know for something like this that when you put how do you do this up down left right perfect and spaces a handbrake\""]
["11:03,240","11:07,200","\"But it doesn't work so good. No, it's gonna work perfect. Watch this handbrake\""]
["11:07,200","11:11,920","\"Shork\""]
["11:11,920","11:19,220","\"Found any doors laid how do I fucking restart push or for oh my gosh these controls are amazing. I'll click this\""]
["11:19,220","11:23,400","\"Alright, thank you sir. You're follow this cursor. He will help all right. I'm fault\""]
["11:23,400","11:28,660","\"Fuck you Chris you'll throw this suspect\""]
["11:28,660","11:33,800","\"It's really oh my god see all right. I got him. I got\""]
["11:33,800","11:38,340","\"This is one of those self-driving police chairs\""]
["11:38,340","11:43,460","\"Let me try okay, what much I get like you more than it's all tries, okay\""]
["11:43,460","11:48,300","\"It's all you after this this but I'm actually gonna succeed this time which I know is surprising to check it out\""]
["11:48,300","11:51,940","\"See it's kind of fun challenging yourself to see how good you can get\""]
["11:51,940","11:52,940","\"FUCK ASS\""]
["11:52,940","11:54,940","\"Ah you lost your mirror\""]
["11:54,940","11:55,940","\"Okay here we go\""]
["11:55,940","11:56,580","\"That's important\""]
["11:56,580","11:58,100","\"Yeah go through the field\""]
