["07:27,300","07:36,300","\"He's imaginative little boy, right? Yeah, the only way it would work as a remake is if you had everyone bully the shit out of him\""]
["07:36,300","07:38,300","\"And that that was the humor\""]
["07:38,300","07:43,000","\"Okay, just have every character like push him around and smack the head off of him\""]
["07:43,000","07:48,780","\"Yeah, okay, and then that would be funny. Okay, everyone hates Doug\""]
["07:51,220","07:56,880","\"You know I'm right the character just really really really that would be funny. You know, I'm right Chris\""]
["07:56,880","08:01,400","\"Why are you just jumping back and forth between platforms? This is fun, dude? You died\""]
["08:01,400","08:06,740","\"You tell me I'm wrong. You wouldn't like to see Doug getting held down by fucking Roger\""]
["08:06,740","08:10,540","\"Imagine Roger holding down Doug and spitting on his face\""]
["08:10,540","08:13,640","\"episode where Doug freaks out because he gets a letter about how\""]
["08:13,640","08:16,580","\"He failed a test. Yeah, he's paranoid\""]
["08:16,580","08:19,460","\"and he tries to open the letter, he ends up setting the house on fire.\""]
["08:19,460","08:20,980","\"And by the end of the episode,\""]
["08:20,980","08:23,700","\"his parents see the letter and\""]
["08:23,700","08:28,260","\"you would think, like in any other show, it'd be like, \"\"Oh, you were wrong about the letter, Doug.\"\"\""]
["08:28,260","08:32,260","\"But no, it was actually what he thought it was. It was a letter telling him that he failed,\""]
["08:32,260","08:37,620","\"so he feels so bad, because, \"\"Aw, man, now I have to get a tutor and Patty's gonna hate me!\"\"\""]
["08:37,620","08:41,780","\"But Patty gets to be the tutor, but that just means that she gets to show up and be like, \"\"Okay,\""]
["08:41,780","08:45,980","\"Doug is an idiot, and I have no interest in him whatsoever,\""]
["08:45,980","08:52,780","\"Yeah, but it ends with him really happy because he doesn't understand that he's so happy that he gets to spend time with Patty\""]
["08:52,780","08:55,580","\"Man is well. She thinks he's a drooling mouth breather\""]
["08:55,580","08:59,740","\"I mean it feels like it feels like in universe. She already hates him\""]
["08:59,740","09:03,180","\"What do you get that same vibe times sometimes?\""]
["09:03,180","09:06,420","\"She is way too nice to him all the time though\""]
["09:06,420","09:12,420","\"It's because she knows he's a drooling moron and she's so she feels pity for him. I mean you don't get a genuine connection\""]
["09:12,420","09:16,020","\"No, okay, imagine Doug getting held down by Patty Mayonnaise\""]
["09:16,020","09:21,260","\"Roger slapping him in the face. I mean Patty mayonnaise held him down in a jar of mayonnaise\""]
["09:21,260","09:24,140","\"Just pouring mayonnaise\""]
["09:24,140","09:32,620","\"Old congealed man. I like this. I like this level. See that's funny and it's charming. I don't think that's true\""]
["09:32,620","09:39,580","\"I don't think either of those things is imagine this is my favorite level imagine Patty holding down Doug pouring mayonnaise in his face and\""]
["09:39,820","09:41,940","\"Rogers burning off Doug's eyebrows with his lighter\""]
["09:41,940","09:50,220","\"Why does he have a lighter? He smokes he's cool. Isn't he like eight? Yeah, okay eight times cooler than Doug\""]
["09:50,220","09:56,020","\"Still that's still too young to be smoking no, it's not\""]
["09:56,020","09:58,840","\"He says give me a smoking he says\""]
["09:58,840","10:06,660","\"Captain pronin's very entertaining also, they know how to animate but they intentionally hold back on it a lot of the time\""]
["10:06,660","10:07,660","\"It sure seems like it.\""]
["10:07,660","10:09,700","\"See, this levels a lot of fun.\""]
["10:09,700","10:10,200","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:10,200","10:11,460","\"This is a really cool one.\""]
["10:11,460","10:13,380","\"Spunk.\""]
["10:13,380","10:15,740","\"Don't fall, Chris.\""]
