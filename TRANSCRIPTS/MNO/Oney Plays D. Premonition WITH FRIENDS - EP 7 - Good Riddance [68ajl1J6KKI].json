["01:23,600","01:25,600","\"- Look at me in the eyes.\""]
["01:25,600","01:26,600","\"purple.\""]
["01:26,600","01:31,080","\"I'm sure I mentioned that I have a personal interest in cases like these.\""]

["01:32,080","01:35,480","\"Good boog, guys.\""]
["01:35,480","01:41,160","\"Why does everybody tap when they're thinking?\""]

["01:59,880","02:05,880","\"His age isn't immediately apparent, though he can't be that white.\""]
["02:05,880","02:07,880","\"Looks like a trustworthy doctor.\""]
["02:07,880","02:10,880","\"Something I would not say about him.\""]
["02:10,880","02:11,880","\"*laughing*\""]
["02:11,880","02:13,880","\"Still no hint of a smile.\""]
["02:13,880","02:18,880","\"There's no reason we should focus our efforts on George.\""]
["02:18,880","02:25,880","\"There's a dead one.\""]
["02:25,880","02:26,880","\"Hello.\""]

["02:30,880","02:31,880","\"Go back to her hand.\""]
["02:31,880","02:32,880","\"Why?\""]
["02:32,880","02:35,880","\"Oh my God.\""]
["02:35,880","02:38,880","\"Judging from the impression she was impressed.\""]
["02:38,880","02:39,880","\"She was impressed.\""]
["02:39,880","02:44,880","\"The object was circular with a relief shaped like a piece mark.\""]
["02:44,880","02:46,880","\"But this was not a peaceful death.\""]
["02:46,880","02:47,880","\"She was real stinky.\""]
["02:47,880","02:54,880","\"not wiggle her big toe. She kinda looks like a woman Thurman.\""]
["02:54,880","02:58,760","\"Uhhhhhh... I guess I could kinda see it.\""]
["02:58,760","03:03,720","\"Traces of a rapper ate a liquid around the eyes. She must have cried.\""]

["03:19,160","03:22,080","\"We'll fix this lady.\""]
["03:22,080","03:26,800","\"From her lack of resistance, I'd say that Anna's injuries happen very quickly.\""]
["03:26,800","03:27,800","\"And for sure.\""]
["03:27,800","03:31,080","\"She was then left to cry herself to death.\""]
["03:31,080","03:33,560","\"The loss of tears killed her.\""]
["03:33,560","03:35,440","\"Zach, it's all starting to come together.\""]

["04:01,240","04:03,240","\"What a loser.\""]
["04:03,240","04:06,240","\"She'll eat anything.\""]
["04:06,240","04:08,240","\"Wow\""]

["04:31,520","04:37,520","\"He gets me just yes the man of your dreams just walked out of your office and you're gonna let him go\""]

["05:39,860","05:47,220","\"What would a lollipop have to do to be worth $25 to you?\""]
["05:47,220","05:53,860","\"It would have to have be the size of my head. Take a cool weed inside of it.\""]
["05:53,860","05:55,620","\"That's a good point.\""]
["05:55,620","05:57,620","\"You're just licking weed then.\""]
["05:57,620","05:58,620","\"They do that.\""]
