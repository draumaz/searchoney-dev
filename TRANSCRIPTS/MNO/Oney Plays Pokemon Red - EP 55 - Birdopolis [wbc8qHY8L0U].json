["05:27,820","05:33,100","\"I when I was a tiny child I would run back and forth across them because I thought that's\""]

["05:49,180","05:50,020","\"- No.\""]

["05:59,260","06:01,420","\"I don't know what the point of it really is.\""]
["06:01,420","06:03,820","\"And they keep cutting away randomly to these kids,\""]
["06:03,820","06:05,580","\"like listing off the, by the way,\""]
["06:05,580","06:07,060","\"Julian, where's the power plant?\""]

["06:22,580","06:27,220","\"So go to Cerulean, and I'll guide you from there.\""]
["06:27,220","06:28,060","\"- Okay.\""]
["06:30,620","06:32,620","\"You make it an in-detronic remix?\""]
["06:32,620","06:37,620","\"Sorry about this, Editor. You obviously don't want to include us getting lost here.\""]
["06:37,620","06:39,620","\"'Cause we were telling a story. Whoops.\""]
["06:39,620","06:42,620","\"What was the story? Okay, but no. I'll continue.\""]
["06:42,620","06:48,620","\"But there's a kid in front of a whole classroom teaching them about Pokémon.\""]
["06:48,620","06:49,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:49,620","06:55,620","\"They wanted to be hit with the kids so they could get their parents to play the stupid card game with them\""]
["06:55,620","06:59,620","\"because they bought these cards and they probably don't have friends or too many friends to play them with.\""]
["06:59,620","07:03,380","\"play them with. I didn't. I mean I didn't get to play them with too many people either\""]
["07:03,380","07:10,500","\"because no one actually knew how to play. Yeah. But then they keep cutting to like these weird\""]
["07:10,500","07:14,980","\"they feel like indie films or something like it's grayscale footage of just kids on playgrounds\""]
["07:14,980","07:18,980","\"and looking sad. My name is Tom. I'm like being behind a chain link fences and things.\""]
["07:18,980","07:24,340","\"When I think of playing baseball I sort of think of Pokemon and it's weird it's like an\""]
["07:24,340","07:27,220","\"the art house film, I don't know why they do it,\""]
["07:27,220","07:29,540","\"and they keep doing it over and over again.\""]
["07:29,540","07:31,300","\"And then they have these parts where there's kids\""]
["07:31,300","07:33,940","\"like in a white room just listing off the cards\""]
["07:33,940","07:34,780","\"that you need.\""]
["07:34,780","07:35,620","\"- I think the marketing--\""]
["07:35,620","07:36,460","\"- And the end of what they say,\""]
["07:36,460","07:39,380","\"they make little comments about like,\""]
["07:39,380","07:41,380","\"well, that's all life is though, right?\""]
["07:41,380","07:44,140","\"- The market for Pokemon seems like it was just\""]

["07:45,460","07:47,780","\"Like they were throwing everything they possibly\""]

["07:51,340","07:53,700","\"you know, tangential demographic.\""]
["07:53,700","07:57,700","\"It's a really bizarre VHS and they had lots of stuff like that tied to Pokemon.\""]

["07:58,700","08:00,700","\"I do remember the spiders.\""]
["08:00,700","08:04,700","\"I also remember the spider that they were trying to kill and plumbers don't wear ties.\""]

["08:06,700","08:07,700","\"Ties I called it.\""]
["08:07,700","08:09,700","\"He wears multiple ties.\""]
