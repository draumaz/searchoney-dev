["01:35,480","01:36,480","\"Is it randomly generated?\""]
["01:36,480","01:37,480","\"Yeah.\""]

["02:22,000","02:23,720","\"Okay, let's try to get out of here.\""]
["02:23,720","02:25,120","\"Look, this is the bomb wand.\""]
["02:25,120","02:28,520","\"It's always real.\""]
["02:28,520","02:30,920","\"It's a little worm thing.\""]
["02:30,920","02:32,080","\"It's a little worm spirit.\""]
["02:32,080","02:32,600","\"Go away.\""]
["02:32,600","02:33,160","\"Worm.\""]
["02:33,160","02:34,800","\"Maybe you can hit it with the bomb.\""]
["02:34,800","02:36,640","\"No, I'm never going to get out of here.\""]
["02:36,640","02:37,160","\"Tomar.\""]
["02:37,160","02:38,840","\"This is a really good first.\""]
["02:38,840","02:40,960","\"This is the worst first game possible.\""]
["02:40,960","02:42,040","\"You know, you could go left.\""]
["02:42,040","02:42,920","\"I've never tried.\""]
["02:42,920","02:47,040","\"Honest engine or just spit up some yellow stuff.\""]
["02:47,040","02:48,200","\"See, that's it.\""]
["02:48,200","02:48,800","\"Now I'm dead.\""]
["02:48,800","02:50,760","\"There's a little burst of little pieces of it too.\""]
["02:50,760","02:52,000","\"That's the end of that game.\""]
["02:52,000","02:54,000","\"Start a new one.\""]
["02:54,000","02:56,000","\"Regular, regular old-timey burp.\""]
["02:56,000","02:59,000","\"If that's true, then why are there little brown pieces inside the yellow?\""]
["02:59,000","03:01,000","\"Stop!\""]
["03:01,000","03:03,000","\"You're actually disgusting.\""]
["03:03,000","03:05,000","\"See, this is how every game starts off.\""]
["03:05,000","03:07,000","\"You go into the cave and now we're in the cave.\""]
["03:07,000","03:09,000","\"This is sort of a standard game.\""]
["03:09,000","03:10,000","\"What on earth is that?\""]
["03:10,000","03:11,000","\"It's a minecart.\""]
["03:11,000","03:13,000","\"You can kick it.\""]
["03:13,000","03:15,000","\"What are these glowing?\""]
["03:15,000","03:16,000","\"That's just the tutorial.\""]
["03:16,000","03:18,000","\"It's just telling you what the controls are.\""]
["03:18,000","03:19,000","\"So now this is the game.\""]
["03:19,000","03:21,000","\"We're in the cave world.\""]
["03:21,000","03:24,220","\"The mind is gonna zap those little those little oh\""]
["03:24,220","03:30,180","\"Your father like it things are these I actually don't know I call them little golems\""]
["03:30,180","03:33,380","\"But they don't really look like golem. They kind of are little golems\""]
["03:33,380","03:39,500","\"So yeah, this is the first level. It's just the mine area and there's like gold and there's like yeah\""]
["03:39,500","03:43,280","\"There's effects it like every pixel is like simulated physics\""]
["03:43,280","03:48,940","\"So there's like like you notice how it creates smoke and the smoke gathers near the top\""]
["03:49,260","03:51,860","\"Yeah, you got the structural environments like worms\""]
["03:51,860","03:57,260","\"That it I always like that the game. I know blow something up take pieces out of something\""]
["03:57,260","04:01,980","\"I think this is one of the most satisfying games ever played now. I maybe there is the objective\""]
["04:01,980","04:07,500","\"But it what's the objective of this game? Just keep going down. Yeah, it's one of those games where it just each level\""]
["04:07,500","04:10,780","\"introduces like new enemies and environments that it's just\""]
["04:10,780","04:15,420","\"But but but the the actual layouts different every time you play and it's all\""]
["04:15,980","04:16,980","\"See Julie, uh, generally?\""]
["04:16,980","04:17,980","\"It's pre-\""]
["04:17,980","04:18,980","\"Yes, it's pre-\""]
["04:18,980","04:20,980","\"Okay, so just to make sure it's pre-\""]
["04:20,980","04:22,860","\"Just see Julie generate, okay, yeah.\""]
["04:22,860","04:23,860","\"Absolutely.\""]
["04:23,860","04:24,860","\"That's great.\""]
["04:24,860","04:25,860","\"It's kind of scary.\""]
["04:25,860","04:27,860","\"Oh, oh look, there's a wand down there.\""]
["04:27,860","04:28,860","\"And I'm stuck.\""]
["04:28,860","04:29,860","\"That guy's like buried in gunpowder.\""]
["04:29,860","04:32,380","\"Yeah, I don't even want a fucking bother.\""]
["04:32,380","04:33,380","\"So this is the whole point.\""]
["04:33,380","04:36,060","\"Whenever you see a shiny shine like that, that means there's a wand.\""]
["04:36,060","04:38,060","\"And that's what you're looking to get?\""]
["04:38,060","04:39,860","\"Yeah, you can have up to four wands.\""]
["04:39,860","04:41,660","\"So now I got a new wand, now I can...\""]
["04:41,660","04:42,660","\"Oh, look, it's fire.\""]
["04:42,660","04:43,660","\"Oh, it's a flame wand.\""]
["04:43,660","04:44,660","\"Well, it's a guy...\""]
["04:44,660","04:45,660","\"I think it's a flame torch.\""]
["04:45,660","04:47,660","\"- It's just a torch. - Yeah, it's...\""]
["04:47,660","04:50,160","\"So he could later add more spells to it,\""]
["04:50,160","04:52,260","\"but right now all it really is is a torch.\""]
["04:52,260","04:55,160","\"- Can I light stuff like that? - I bet you can.\""]
["04:55,160","04:57,360","\"- Go up to something flammable like a piece of glass.\""]
["04:57,360","04:59,060","\"- You might need like, yeah, gunpowder.\""]
["04:59,060","05:00,060","\"- Oh, you just stand under it.\""]
["05:00,060","05:02,060","\"- Oh, oh, you like yourself. - I love myself.\""]
["05:02,060","05:04,560","\"- So he's got a little flask of water,\""]
["05:04,560","05:07,660","\"so he just splashed himself with water to put himself out.\""]
["05:07,660","05:08,660","\"- Isn't that cool?\""]
["05:08,660","05:09,660","\"What's that?\""]
["05:09,660","05:12,260","\"- Yeah, be careful around gunpowder with that thing.\""]
["05:12,260","05:13,760","\"- I don't think that's just dirt.\""]
["05:13,760","05:15,560","\"- I think you're right that it's just dirt.\""]
["05:15,560","05:20,480","\"And then there's blood and there's water. See now I got blood and water on me. What does blood do to them are?\""]
["05:20,480","05:23,640","\"On wait, it's on you. Yeah, I actually don't know\""]
["05:23,640","05:29,200","\"Like you're the one with the theory that it makes certain enemies angry if you have blood on you\""]
["05:29,200","05:31,960","\"That's just what I assumed it would do, but I actually don't know\""]
["05:31,960","05:42,280","\"Look there's nine over I've never read up on it\""]
["05:42,920","05:49,000","\"Treasure. Oh, that's a big treasure chest gold here. I'm gonna put it. I'm gonna put it. You just put a bomb right here blowing down right below you\""]
["05:49,000","05:51,000","\"I can I'm not gonna do that. Oh\""]
["05:51,000","05:54,440","\"And then there's gold\""]
["05:54,440","06:02,480","\"Line of fire. Yeah, yeah bird the fucking eyeball stupid eyeball. He's gonna die probably. He's gonna he's gonna take you with him\""]
["06:02,480","06:09,980","\"Look, he's leaking green. Oh, there he goes. Oh God. Give me my gold your greed made you fall to fire\""]
["06:09,980","06:17,360","\"But yeah, and when he's got oh fuck see if he had water on his on his clothes it would have he wouldn't have caught fire\""]
["06:17,360","06:21,780","\"Look at all this gold to him are nice. You got 200 already\""]
["06:21,780","06:25,100","\"Under some gold right here\""]
["06:25,100","06:30,180","\"Also, what do you do with gold? What is that? What does that let you do? So at the end of this level?\""]
["06:30,180","06:32,180","\"There's gonna be a store that you can spend oh\""]
["06:32,180","06:39,100","\"There's another new one. What does this one do? It's not another torch. It's another torch. Does it fire? Nope?\""]
["06:39,300","06:42,180","\"Look, he's got a floppy cape. Yeah\""]
["06:42,180","06:49,820","\"That's pretty much the whole game. He's got a floppy cape. Yeah, so it's left trigger is that is both jump and fly\""]
["06:49,820","06:54,380","\"It's the same button. Oh fuck basically holding it just makes you keep going up until\""]
["06:54,380","06:58,880","\"You run out of see see those meters in the top right, Zach\""]
["06:58,880","07:06,260","\"First one's obviously health the second one is like your jump power so you can shoot up until that runs out\""]
["07:06,260","07:08,260","\"It's like your jet pack basically\""]
["07:08,260","07:12,600","\"And then the third one is what is the third one?\""]
["07:12,600","07:20,080","\"Oh, that's just mana, which your standard thing doesn't really spend very quickly, but some of the more powerful spells\""]
["07:20,080","07:23,240","\"will drain that really fast and then you have to wait for it to recharge.\""]
["07:23,240","07:25,300","\"What are the rules of flying around? Like, if you...\""]
["07:25,300","07:26,560","\"How long do you fly around for?\""]
["07:26,560","07:30,360","\"As long as that orange bar has something in it, you can fly.\""]
["07:30,360","07:31,060","\"Oh, I see.\""]
["07:31,060","07:33,960","\"And it recharges as soon as you stop using it.\""]
["07:34,360","07:38,520","\"Yeah, the first level is kind of mostly about just getting gold so you can spend it at the store\""]
["07:38,520","07:45,240","\"Now we're not gonna be any gold member references. We've been a pack to the beginning. Oh, there's a wand right there. What is that?\""]
["07:45,240","07:50,680","\"Yeah, I want that. Oh look all this gold right here. I'm gonna get all this shit, right?\""]
["07:50,680","07:53,220","\"No, come back bomb\""]
["07:53,220","07:59,920","\"Look at all that fucking gold. Oh, I see so it's also built into the ground. Yeah, the blow it out of the fucking earth\""]
["07:59,920","08:03,000","\"Yeah, sometimes you get stuck in it. It's kind of shit\""]
["08:03,480","08:07,560","\"If it's closer certain things can coax it out, okay?\""]
["08:07,560","08:13,080","\"I don't need two torches. Oh, that's a bomb - is it yeah? That's like some cut I think it's glitter bomb\""]
["08:13,080","08:17,640","\"Look at that. It's not as strong as a real bomb\""]
["08:17,640","08:21,760","\"But yeah, that's the glitter bomb\""]
["08:21,760","08:28,320","\"Wait, wait, we can go mining with this now. Just get a bunch of gold we could try\""]
["08:30,600","08:32,600","\"There's a spider what is this? Oh?\""]
["08:32,600","08:38,840","\"There's a guy with a gun and a big shotgun a big big. Did you see that big big big big eyeball boy?\""]
["08:38,840","08:41,840","\"That's a big he's he's the glitter bombs on him. Oh\""]
["08:41,840","08:50,160","\"They caught him. Yeah, she did you blew his fucking rocks get blast that guy directly with the bombs. Oh\""]
["08:50,160","08:54,560","\"Oh, he's a going up and down\""]
["08:54,560","08:58,440","\"All right, he's fucked. Whoa. No, he's still living\""]
["08:59,440","09:06,360","\"More guys. He's making little babies. Oh shit. Look at all and they're all dropping toxic slud. He died\""]
["09:06,360","09:13,080","\"Yeah, he dropped I think he's dropping acid. Oh is that straight acid? Yeah, that hurts you way faster\""]
["09:13,080","09:19,680","\"Look at the gas going on fire. I fucking love this remember powder game. Did you ever see that? No?\""]
["09:19,680","09:21,960","\"It was a it was a browser kind of a thing\""]
["09:21,960","09:26,980","\"That it just had different particles like this, but they this is like they made a game out of it. So cool\""]
["09:27,960","09:34,160","\"How different is it to do particle effects for something like this when it's like a flat 2d platform reverses?\""]
["09:34,160","09:42,380","\"I honestly think it's pretty complicated a game like this no no no like each pixel like has its own like material and physics\""]
["09:42,380","09:50,340","\"I have a feeling this was coded from scratch, but I could be wrong. Maybe this was game maker. Oh fuck no\""]
["09:50,340","09:56,440","\"Or some or unity or some other common. This is make go ahead of it do this sucks\""]
["09:56,520","10:03,680","\"Okay, fuck no just go for go for the fucking exit go for the exit you still have 20 now you have 20 out you'll make it\""]
["10:03,680","10:07,720","\"Oh, no, oh god getting the water\""]
["10:07,720","10:18,600","\"What did that do what was wrong those poison he was poisoned the water will rinse off fire and and acid and stuff she's\""]
["10:18,600","10:21,560","\"Look we can buy stuff now though. All right\""]
["10:21,560","10:27,360","\"So this is stuff you can put on your wand you can buy like everything if you wanted. I wish you could buy multiple fireballs\""]
["10:27,360","10:29,360","\"There's 15 fireball\""]

["02:43:05,480","02:43:08,600","\"and made up what they did and no one fucking knew\""]
