["06:01,720","06:07,000","\"Oh, yeah, they record their like trumpets and like trombones really close to the mic so it sounds way more like, you know\""]
["06:07,680","06:13,560","\"Crystal clear. Yeah, that's true. You can really hear the trumpets. I love fucking drag like neon Genesis Evangelion\""]

["06:28,600","06:32,520","\"But maybe I'm just a fucking it is always an antiquated technique\""]
["06:32,880","06:36,720","\"They're like that's the only way they could do it, but now that they have software they're like well\""]
["06:36,720","06:41,200","\"No, it's still pure to do it the real way. Why did my brother fucking lead me down there? Oh\""]
["06:41,200","06:52,600","\"I mean there are people that are still like super pretty I mean fucking the the guys from daft punk that when they were recording that\""]

["07:16,680","07:18,160","\"- Oh, my bad.\""]
["07:18,160","07:21,160","\"- But so there's a track on it where they talk to this guy,\""]

["07:29,800","07:30,640","\"- Oh, okay.\""]
["07:30,640","07:35,160","\"But anyway, they did this big long interview with him.\""]
["07:35,160","07:36,880","\"They only used a clip of it in the thing.\""]

["07:39,320","07:44,320","\"they asked him to talk about things in certain decades.\""]
["07:44,320","07:46,480","\"So he'd talk about the 50s and then he'd talk about the 60s\""]
["07:46,480","07:47,520","\"and he'd talk about the 70s.\""]
["07:47,520","07:50,120","\"And as he was doing that, they changed mics\""]
["07:50,120","07:51,640","\"so that when he was talking about the 50s,\""]
["07:51,640","07:53,600","\"he was talking about it on a 50s mic.\""]
["07:53,600","07:54,640","\"And when he was talking about the 60s,\""]
