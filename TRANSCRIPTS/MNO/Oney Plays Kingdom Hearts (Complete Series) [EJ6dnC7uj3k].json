["04:39,320","04:43,040","\"They always do really good special effects. They always do really good sound effects. Yeah\""]
["04:43,040","04:48,000","\"Like um, I'm a one final fantasy 10 first came out the particle effects and that blew me away\""]

["05:26,460","05:31,220","\"I think that's just because I like the cartoon aesthetic in general as opposed to specifically\""]
["05:31,220","05:37,320","\"Skyloaf human words, you know if he wasn't wearing those clothes you could fit many anime. Yeah, look at the size of them pixels\""]

["06:52,160","06:58,160","\"Oops, it's the end of the day and I wasn't productive. I procrastinated oops\""]
["06:58,160","07:00,160","\"That's a funny one or uh\""]
["07:00,160","07:07,080","\"Have a an emotion you feel and they're drawn as a big buff man. That's punching you in the face\""]
["07:07,080","07:09,040","\"That's right\""]
["07:09,040","07:10,880","\"It's a little selfie\""]
["07:10,880","07:16,140","\"Take a self pusher in there and there's Johnny oh shit. I fucked up\""]
["07:16,140","07:21,320","\"I took I can reset it. What you got to reset it why?\""]
["07:21,320","07:25,900","\"Why it's a it says it says is this the path you want and you say no why?\""]
["07:25,900","07:32,580","\"Because it's a this little quiz determines how you level up really yes, it's fucking stupid\""]
["07:32,580","07:34,580","\"I never knew that until recently\""]
["07:34,580","07:39,940","\"All of all the shit at the beginning actually changes things about oh, this still counts on second thought\""]
["07:39,940","07:44,420","\"I mean you wanted to do the regular where there's no variance. Yeah, I do that. Do that one\""]
["07:44,420","07:48,620","\"So you pick all the top options\""]
["07:48,620","07:53,880","\"You level up really quick, but then you stop leveling up it goes really slow at the end of the game\""]
["07:53,880","07:59,120","\"Other way around if you pick the bottom options middle has it just averaged the whole way through\""]
["07:59,120","08:01,620","\"There's no indication of that\""]
["08:01,620","08:03,860","\"You're just supposed to know\""]
["08:03,860","08:06,660","\"But don't know I\""]
["08:06,900","08:09,240","\"Listen to the soundtracks. Yeah, that's episode one\""]
["08:09,240","08:15,420","\"Stop every time I do a song you say it sounds like you always do that one song. No, it doesn't sound like that\""]
["08:15,420","08:17,100","\"Go that that that led\""]
["08:17,100","08:20,000","\"Did it led that that led? This game has been\""]
["08:20,000","08:23,060","\"Julian do you like the hollow bastion music? Oh?\""]
["08:23,060","08:27,140","\"Love that music. That's my favorite level\""]
["08:27,140","08:33,580","\"We're never gonna get there. I hate that level. I love the music. You have to play for like fucking 12 hours. Mm-hmm\""]
["08:33,580","08:36,140","\"We'll put only dinner here\""]
["08:36,140","08:39,420","\"I think we should turn this off to avoid getting this.\""]
["08:39,420","08:43,140","\"Tell me again about how when Kingdom Hearts was first announced, you thought it was an\""]
["08:43,140","08:44,900","\"April Fool's prank.\""]
["08:44,900","08:46,900","\"What?\""]
["08:46,900","08:51,740","\"I got a gaming magazine and it's a coming soon Kingdom Hearts.\""]
["08:51,740","08:54,940","\"Also a show Gregory Horror Show was in there and that pissed me off because I really wanted\""]
["08:54,940","08:56,860","\"that to come out over here.\""]
["08:56,860","08:59,180","\"But which that one doesn't make any sense.\""]
["08:59,180","09:03,300","\"Was that before the game was before the show, right?\""]
["09:03,300","09:05,620","\"Game was after the show.\""]
["09:05,620","09:10,380","\"the \"\"That's fully translated. It came out in Europe. I don't know why we didn't get it.\"\"\""]
["09:10,380","09:21,460","\"But they... it's like coming soon. Kingdom Hearts! And it showed... one of the heartless, it was the one wearing the helmet. It was talking about... \"\"Heart... Darkness.\"\" and it was like mentioning all this stuff.\""]
["09:21,460","09:28,180","\"And then here's all these Disney characters. I just thought to myself \"\"What the fuck is this? Is this the April Fool's magazine?\"\" 'Cause they would do that. Yeah.\""]
["09:28,180","09:30,180","\"Every magazine had their April Fool's jokes.\""]
["09:30,180","09:31,180","\"Like, there was a...\""]
["09:31,180","09:36,180","\"I think electronic gaming monthly had the one where it showed the fake Sonic and Super Smash Bros. Melee.\""]
["09:36,180","09:37,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:37,180","09:38,180","\"Stuff like that.\""]
["09:38,180","09:41,180","\"So I thought it was an April Fool's joke. I didn't think it was a real game.\""]
["09:41,180","09:43,180","\"But then it came out.\""]
["09:43,180","09:44,180","\"'Cause why the...\""]
["09:44,180","09:45,180","\"What...\""]
["09:45,180","09:48,180","\"What made them think that was a good idea?\""]
["09:48,180","09:52,180","\"I really don't know how they came up with that idea and why it stuck.\""]
["09:52,180","09:53,180","\"I don't know.\""]
["09:53,180","09:56,180","\"It was a Disney representative and a Square Enix representative.\""]
["09:56,180","09:57,180","\"No, I know that.\""]
["09:57,180","10:02,460","\"I know I know about all that but still what made them think that was a good idea\""]
["10:02,460","10:08,220","\"Well, obviously it was I guess I guess you can't say that if it fucking took off\""]
["10:08,220","10:15,180","\"It took off cuz children are fucking kids like stupid shit\""]
["10:15,180","10:19,940","\"It's like seeing their favorite characters meet everybody I've talked to as the same story\""]
["10:19,940","10:21,940","\"they picked up the game because they saw that\""]
["10:21,940","10:27,140","\"Nightmare for Christmas was in it and that's definitely why I picked it up because I had a final fantasy\""]
["10:27,140","10:34,140","\"I didn't even like any other Final Fantasy part from 7 when I was younger.\""]
["10:34,140","10:36,140","\"I still kinda don't.\""]
["10:36,140","10:39,140","\"I never played 6 even though I'm here, that's the best one.\""]
["10:39,140","10:41,140","\"I think you would like 6.\""]
["10:41,140","10:45,140","\"When I first played this, I thought the plot was really deep and one-out-of-the-art.\""]
["10:45,140","10:46,140","\"Of course.\""]
["10:46,140","10:48,140","\"I thought it was a little general.\""]
["10:48,140","10:53,140","\"Because if you're audience enough that your plot is too complex.\""]
["10:53,140","10:55,540","\"Yeah, all you have to do is be like a heart\""]
["10:55,540","11:00,620","\"Kyrie is in the darkness and you're like wow really?\""]
["11:00,620","11:03,900","\"It's almost like how five nights of Freddy's if you just hide a\""]
["11:03,900","11:07,180","\"Message it makes everyone think it's deep. It's all about\""]
["11:07,180","11:09,700","\"How you how you communicate?\""]
["11:09,700","11:14,820","\"The point is kids are really stupid and a lot of the stuff you like when you're young you're probably in so hot now\""]
["11:14,820","11:15,740","\"What's you doing?\""]
["11:15,740","11:20,420","\"Just dancing look at him. Hello little boy. Where's my heart go?\""]
["11:20,420","11:22,420","\"Get in me\""]
["11:22,420","11:24,420","\"Why does he have a heart hole?\""]
["11:24,420","11:27,220","\"Well, I have a heart hole for...\""]
["11:27,220","11:29,220","\"Heart hole for...\""]
["11:29,220","11:32,220","\"Gartoons don't do that.\""]
["11:32,220","11:35,220","\"You beat it!\""]
["11:35,220","11:36,220","\"Oh jump jump jump!\""]
["11:36,220","11:38,220","\"Shit you didn't do it!\""]
["11:38,220","11:40,220","\"You're supposed to jump when it goes slow.\""]
["11:40,220","11:46,420","\"I'll say the one thing that Kingdom Hearts 2 added that I fucking hated was how you\""]
["11:46,420","11:49,420","\"couldn't win a boss battle until you finished a combo.\""]
["11:49,420","11:50,420","\"Really?\""]
["11:50,420","11:56,420","\"So you'd always get stuck because they would like counter your attacks or something.\""]
["11:56,420","12:00,620","\"And at least in this one it's just like okay when their HP hit zero you win.\""]
["12:00,620","12:02,620","\"Yeah, that makes more sense.\""]
["12:02,620","12:08,220","\"It's because they want it to look cooler when it does that like slo-mo thing.\""]
["12:08,220","12:14,420","\"Julian, next time you beat a boss and it goes slo-mo you jump and you swing your sword and it looks cool.\""]
["12:14,420","12:15,020","\"Wow.\""]
["12:15,020","12:18,220","\"By the way this opening is much more interesting than anything on the island.\""]

["12:32,020","12:34,020","\"Over the course of fucking like, what is it?\""]
["12:34,020","12:36,020","\"In like seven games?\""]
["12:36,020","12:38,020","\"Now, trip and fall down the water a bunch of times.\""]
