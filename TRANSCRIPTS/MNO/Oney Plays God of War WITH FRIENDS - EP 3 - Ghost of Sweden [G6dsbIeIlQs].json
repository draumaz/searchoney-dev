["00:20,640","00:22,940","\"Like, this game I feel like...\""]
["00:22,940","00:26,880","\"If I put my mind to it, I could make it just like 3D what? Like, wise?\""]
["00:26,880","00:28,700","\"Like, the models aren't that, like, you know?\""]
["00:28,700","00:35,660","\"Complicated whatever but now games have gotten to a point where it's like so that's so complicated in detail now like all these new\""]
["00:35,660","00:41,260","\"But nobody but you never need that like indie studios are still constantly doing stuff that like\""]
["00:41,260","00:45,520","\"You know you only need a small team to make yeah, that's true\""]
["00:45,520","00:50,340","\"And if I remember that like jelly blood looked super good back in day\""]
["00:50,340","00:52,980","\"How come he looks so good here now did they read this one?\""]

["01:53,300","01:58,880","\"Kratos is a little entitled I think he just expects the guys to relieve him of his nightmares\""]
["01:58,880","02:05,800","\"I don't think that's so much to ask he's got pale privilege\""]
["02:05,800","02:08,980","\"The god believe me of my nightmares\""]
["02:08,980","02:11,540","\"Yeah, it only took me like two years\""]
["02:11,540","02:14,860","\"Yeah, cuz you were praying to the right ones. Yeah\""]
["02:14,860","02:21,940","\"This one I wouldn't trust this one. What the fuck would you pray to Athena? What's she got of?\""]

["02:25,660","02:31,780","\"Athena's just that bitch that fucking goes on Instagram and she finds like the pictures of stars with like the the\""]
["02:31,780","02:38,140","\"Inspirational quotes over them. She's like this is so deep and she like posts it with song lyrics online\""]
["02:38,140","02:41,420","\"That's what she would be if she was\""]
["02:41,420","02:46,100","\"Rather than an ancient Greek god just like a 20 year old white girl today\""]
["02:46,100","02:48,900","\"So she's got an exotic pet that she can't look after\""]
["02:50,940","02:52,940","\"And she just blathers on\""]
["02:52,940","02:56,700","\"She's got like a chin chilla and it's got like gallstones\""]
["02:56,700","03:03,800","\"Did I bang these girls or would that make this video demonetized? It's actually it becomes more censored\""]
["03:03,800","03:06,620","\"You start having sex with them because you can't see their titties\""]
["03:06,620","03:12,440","\"Full circle. There you go. And just like in real life. I'm good at it. That was inappropriate\""]
["03:12,440","03:19,980","\"In approach that Kratos is only so angry because he's diabetic and has low blood sugar\""]
["03:20,460","03:25,200","\"Do you think that that's that could be contributing factor to his ire his ire\""]
["03:25,200","03:35,100","\"You got a new enemy type you got to use L1 to block these guys oh\""]
["03:35,100","03:42,540","\"Could you block up until this point you probably could have I\""]
["03:42,540","03:46,140","\"Don't I am well. This is the first time it tells you the game shit\""]
["03:46,140","03:50,040","\"The game is acknowledging that blocking was not necessary up until this point\""]
["03:50,040","03:54,140","\"But maybe you should consider it now you haven't gotten to the point where you actually can use\""]
["03:54,140","03:59,580","\"Or is it just a matter of going into a menu to spend here like red points. Let's see\""]
["03:59,580","04:04,960","\"You just been neglecting that this whole time. Oh, yeah, you have been\""]
["04:04,960","04:07,460","\"You can upgrade your main weapons\""]
["04:07,460","04:13,820","\"The blades of chaos are just the best item in this game and we shouldn't bother upgrading anything else\""]
["04:14,620","04:17,380","\"You know, I think everybody is\""]
["04:17,380","04:23,620","\"Go for it. It won't be like you didn't upgrade that fucking hammer you go on the guys back\""]
["04:23,620","04:29,060","\"I like in the third one they just fucking stopped trying because I guess everybody like the blaze of chaos too much\""]
["04:29,060","04:31,060","\"So everything is just blazing chaos\""]
["04:31,060","04:37,000","\"Me they're pretty cool. They are I think they're need oh did he get rid of it in a new one\""]

["04:43,260","04:49,940","\"Yeah, it looks like he's fee fights with more like conventional weapons. He has like an axe that's like Thor's hammer that fucking like comes back to him\""]
["04:49,940","04:53,340","\"Little stupid\""]
["04:53,340","04:56,300","\"Although that would make sense because they're fighting a\""]
["04:56,300","05:04,100","\"Norse gods now, right? Oh, did they decide to like change the theming? No, no, I\""]
["05:04,100","05:10,340","\"Hope he fights Jesus. Who's the ghost of Sparta though? He's not the ghost of like Sweden\""]
["05:11,380","05:18,500","\"Ghost of speed this is silly because the blaze of chaos are really iconic and fun check this out. Oh, yeah\""]

["05:40,080","05:42,880","\"I wouldn't have noticed it unless...\""]
["05:42,880","05:47,080","\"Like when you think about when you're programming for these older consoles, you really did have to like...\""]
["05:47,080","05:50,580","\"be legit worried about like RAM limitations.\""]
["05:50,580","05:55,580","\"The PlayStation 2 only had maybe like one or two gigs of memory for the whole system.\""]

["05:56,880","05:58,080","\"What's that last right?\""]
["05:58,080","06:00,080","\"Maybe less, yeah.\""]
["06:00,080","06:04,080","\"Like because it was dedicated and these things couldn't multitask...\""]
["06:04,080","06:05,580","\"If I recall correctly...\""]
["06:05,580","06:07,580","\"It might have been 512 megs.\""]
["06:07,580","06:13,940","\"I want to say that the fucking like Xbox 360 and PS3 only had 512 legs. I don't know about that\""]

["09:32,700","09:35,180","\"- Oh, so there's little stick of shock.\""]

["09:57,340","09:58,780","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:58,780","10:03,060","\"for $10 million I could probably hire like bodyguards to\""]

["11:06,180","11:06,980","\"[laughs]\""]
["11:06,980","11:12,480","\"Also, you know what? Now that I'm thinking about it, just walking around would kind of wither it down over the course of a few weeks.\""]
