["03:07,220","03:10,220","\"Ligrini is a mighty warrior. He cannot be stopped\""]
["03:10,220","03:15,340","\"I'd vote for him. Me too. I don't even think Ligrini is a sentient\""]

["03:51,800","03:56,880","\"Oh the story goes the cow kicked over a lantern and it caused a fire\""]
["03:56,880","04:02,640","\"I was expecting me thing to be part of it if someone's cow caused a fire you'd want that person executed\""]
["04:02,640","04:08,240","\"I'm gonna come out and say it like grandma had a three-legged cow called Hitler. Did she execute it? No?\""]

["05:58,880","06:03,900","\"He'd probably only have like one tenth of the delegates needed to be the nominee, but he'd still stay and he'd be like John Kasich\""]
["06:03,900","06:06,660","\"Okay, he's stand to the very end captain Falcon\""]
["06:06,660","06:12,600","\"Yeah, he'd be the Republican nominee for sure. Yeah, but like obviously he's not in this\""]
