["03:17,640","03:23,320","\"Jack Jack Jack Jack. Oh swap that ead it out. He's not gonna fight with you, huh?\""]
["03:23,320","03:28,880","\"This world is so frightening\""]
["03:28,880","03:36,320","\"I feel a generalized sense of anxiety here. There's nothing fun about it\""]
["03:36,320","03:43,280","\"In the other worlds even though we were in very real danger at least they look aesthetically pleasing\""]
["03:43,280","03:46,640","\"Look at the life meters. They're even desaturated\""]
["03:46,640","03:53,920","\"I guess they would look kind of weird sticking out really colorful and shit\""]
["03:53,920","04:02,520","\"So why are you back here the movies over\""]
["04:02,520","04:08,760","\"I already we have further adventures to have in crazy things going on\""]
["04:08,760","04:13,160","\"Kingdom Hearts needs to use the plot of the movies\""]
["04:13,160","04:16,980","\"I don't know how the fuck they're gonna do it without any plot left. It's gonna be boring\""]
["04:16,980","04:21,680","\"Stab Sora\""]
["04:21,680","04:26,920","\"Like it's really gentle like slow like yeah\""]
["04:26,920","04:35,540","\"Scally wag. Oh no Julie. What's the plot now? What's happening? We have to go get the coins\""]
["04:35,540","04:41,760","\"Why do you got to get the coins to put the dead back to rest? I thought they already did that\""]
["04:42,640","04:48,160","\"Nothing something happened now. That's a new it's a new situation thing happen Chris cure\""]
["04:48,160","04:49,120","\"Nightly\""]
["04:49,120","04:53,360","\"I got figured out what the thing is that happened. It's a mystery wipes his nose\""]
["04:53,360","04:59,560","\"If you had a game that looked just like this that was just the Pirates of the Caribbean game on PS2\""]
["04:59,560","05:03,560","\"Without any sort of dolla goofy of course would you play it?\""]
["05:03,560","05:09,880","\"I would just go this looks fucking ugly. I would only play to sort of Donald and goofy were there\""]
["05:11,560","05:14,360","\"Chasing you down like a fucking horrific plague\""]
["05:14,360","05:19,440","\"You probably make a horror game out of goofy chasing you down hallway or something\""]
["05:19,440","05:26,680","\"Yep as long as you make a game really dark anything pretty much if there's a loud noise as the consequence you got a horror game\""]
["05:26,680","05:30,280","\"Like that's you're not we're not even joking. No, that's why you do\""]
["05:30,280","05:37,560","\"Take a thing that usually is innocent feeling the people and make it evil\""]
["05:38,160","05:42,440","\"There you go. I would actually really like to make a unity horror game. I\""]
["05:42,440","05:46,160","\"May know it's gonna be a pirate game. It could be\""]
["05:46,160","05:53,360","\"That would you guys play that witch hunt game? I didn't but it looked you're it was it was a fun little idea\""]
["05:53,360","05:55,360","\"I think I really really wish\""]
["05:55,360","06:00,120","\"Thanks the last boss. I probably I would hope are they gonna continue?\""]
["06:00,120","06:03,920","\"Development on it because you know you pretty much have done developing this now, okay?\""]
["06:03,920","06:08,460","\"Well, that's fair, but you could probably make something really good with that premise. I think\""]
["06:08,460","06:13,920","\"That was my favorite games up until the last class. I swear to God the way the the gameplay is set up\""]
["06:13,920","06:15,920","\"I think is interesting. Yeah, I\""]
["06:15,920","06:22,200","\"Think it makes you feel fear. Yeah nicely. I like that, you know\""]
["06:22,200","06:25,520","\"What was it called again?\""]
["06:25,520","06:29,440","\"Which I would like to try it sometime. I just don't know what I'm gonna be able to I\""]
["06:30,120","06:32,640","\"I would like a game where you're home alone in your little house\""]
["06:32,640","06:37,240","\"Let's call home alone, and you turn on the radio and it says eight baboon has escaped the\""]
["06:37,240","06:40,440","\"And then you look at the window. There's a baboon trying to get in\""]
["06:40,440","06:53,940","\"Pulls out your phone wires and he turns off your electricity you have to outsmart him you have to try and get out of the house without him\""]
["06:53,940","06:57,300","\"Clong at you you have a minute before he's unleashed inside the house\""]
["06:57,300","06:59,300","\"You can block these doorways and stools.\""]
["06:59,300","07:01,300","\"They're on a timer?\""]
["07:01,300","07:02,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:02,300","07:03,300","\"That'd be fun.\""]
["07:03,300","07:05,300","\"You're gonna walk down in the house with this bad boy.\""]
["07:05,300","07:07,300","\"We have some barricade doorways before he comes in.\""]
["07:07,300","07:09,300","\"And hide the bananas.\""]
["07:09,300","07:11,300","\"There's three bananas in the house that you have to hide.\""]
["07:11,300","07:13,300","\"If he finds all three, he becomes extra powerful.\""]
["07:13,300","07:14,300","\"Damn.\""]
["07:14,300","07:16,300","\"Whoa!\""]
["07:16,300","07:19,300","\"That would be actually kind of funny, like putting food around the house,\""]
["07:19,300","07:21,300","\"and if he finds it, he gets better.\""]
["07:21,300","07:22,300","\"I'd play the shit out of that.\""]
["07:22,300","07:25,300","\"It'd be scary if there was a little chimp on the loose, trying to rip your face off.\""]
["07:25,300","07:27,300","\"No, that would be awful that would be horrifying\""]
["07:27,300","07:32,120","\"Would you like the game mechanic where you can shove your head out of a window and call for nearby people?\""]
["07:32,120","07:36,020","\"And then if the UPS guy comes he's like I brought your Amazon fresh\""]
["07:36,020","07:39,460","\"And he drops off a big bunch of groceries to the door and the baboon eats them all\""]
["07:39,460","07:40,380","\"Yeah, it's their bananas\""]
["07:40,380","07:43,300","\"See if they try and yell and throw things at him so that the UPS guy goes away\""]
["07:43,300","07:46,140","\"While you're hiding from the baboon\""]
["07:46,140","07:52,180","\"That's rumble rowdy rumble ready rumble on the Kingdom Hearts - soundtrack\""]
["07:52,540","07:59,900","\"You need to be able to program it so the baboon is able to climb up anything in the room or to jump off the walls randomly\""]
["07:59,900","08:02,660","\"That would be cool\""]
["08:02,660","08:10,540","\"No someone's taken all that's convenient for blood\""]
["08:10,540","08:14,580","\"But I couldn't see who it was\""]
["08:14,580","08:18,460","\"Yeah\""]
["08:19,420","08:23,340","\"She had these big round ears. He said something about door to darkness\""]
["08:23,340","08:29,340","\"Organization 13 he told me that I was full of light when that he was full of dark\""]
["08:29,340","08:34,560","\"He said to give into the darkness. I didn't quite understand\""]
["08:34,560","08:37,020","\"Like hold him eight pussy loser\""]
["08:37,020","08:41,180","\"What would you even do if a stranger and a cloak approach you on the street and he said something like that?\""]

["08:57,100","09:00,340","\"And he said to give into the dark if it was in the world where Kingdom Hearts didn't exist\""]
["09:00,340","09:04,580","\"I would literally just assume like oh my god. This is a cult. This is this is definitely a call\""]
["09:04,580","09:09,020","\"He summoned little men wearing suits of armor and they shot laser beams at me\""]
["09:09,020","09:14,180","\"I don't even know what those are at what like what time period is this? I don't know we're pirates\""]

["09:36,200","09:40,340","\"It was dreamcast\""]

["10:06,340","10:11,500","\"But it's nice to me. I think this color scheme works for him better than the the one from the original game\""]
["10:11,500","10:16,700","\"Why really he was he was like he was like bright purple. Oh, yeah\""]
["10:16,700","10:20,100","\"I was reading comments that said that a lot of the color schemes are different. Why?\""]
["10:20,100","10:23,780","\"For the final mix I assume but like why?\""]
["10:23,780","10:27,820","\"Because they were like oh look it's new content. We recolored things\""]
["10:27,820","10:35,220","\"That's really it. I don't know they didn't I don't know if they like do different things or anything like that schemes usually better\""]
["10:35,220","10:41,480","\"I think they're usually better. It's it feels like when it feels like when they pick colors for\""]
["10:41,480","10:44,060","\"Pokemon Chinese\""]
["10:44,060","10:47,540","\"They're just like kind of weird and unpleasant feeling\""]
