["07:52,020","07:57,360","\"You said you're not scared of ghosts. Well, I'm saying if you actually had concrete evidence of that happening. Oh\""]
["07:57,360","08:03,840","\"Well, okay. Well, so that counts as concrete evidence to you the fact that they fought it earlier sure\""]
["08:03,840","08:07,140","\"You do if the fact that they killed him earlier. He became possessed\""]
["08:07,140","08:12,660","\"Somebody you thought was dead again and he started teleporting around somebody thought you thought was dead appeared before you\""]

["08:53,380","08:57,500","\"It's also not like goofy cartoon lion. You just described him as a ghost lion didn't you?\""]
["08:57,500","09:00,580","\"I just met like somebody from your own personal path\""]
["09:00,580","09:05,780","\"You're the one who assumed that it's a lion, but I'm willing to go with that because it's kind of weird\""]
["09:05,780","09:10,600","\"I wasn't assuming it was the lion. I was going off of what just happened in the game and he's talking about it\""]
["09:10,600","09:11,640","\"I\""]
["09:11,640","09:15,100","\"Assume a ghost lion would be a thing that would startle you\""]

["09:31,020","09:37,980","\"Something that shows up in such a stylized manner. I would not consider to threat. I'd be like I'm imagining this or something\""]
["09:37,980","09:44,500","\"Hmm do you imagine things that are as elaborate as that Julian? No, okay\""]
["09:44,780","09:48,340","\"Would you not be concerned then that maybe that your mind conjured that?\""]
["09:48,340","09:56,700","\"Maybe I'm dreaming maybe it's like a illusion. Maybe there's a Scooby-Doo villain casting it. Would you want to risk casting a film real on a\""]
["09:56,700","10:01,980","\"assumption though I mean if it looks that way then yeah, that's how I would react\""]
["10:01,980","10:07,940","\"I wouldn't be scared. I'm just saying if this line appeared in real life. I don't think you'd be casually dismissing it\""]

["10:12,340","10:16,620","\"Like why am I being haunted by this lion at what point did I harm a lion?\""]
["10:16,620","10:23,060","\"I don't know. Why are they being haunted? I know they killed them. I should have been paying attention at the same time\""]
["10:23,060","10:25,060","\"Why is there a lion ghost?\""]
["10:25,060","10:28,580","\"I assume that something bad happened to him and he's stuck there\""]
["10:28,580","10:35,860","\"I mean something bad did happen you killed him. I saw it. I like sliding around here. Do it more\""]
["10:35,860","10:39,620","\"I do think it's fun. No, that's a friend like that\""]
["10:41,180","10:43,180","\"That's just like that looks satisfying\""]
["10:43,180","10:47,980","\"Disney if you ever do a Lion King game again, you have to make it control like this\""]
["10:47,980","10:55,900","\"Just give the player car. There's a little lion guard video game. I don't know if there's a lion guard video game boy advance\""]
["10:55,900","10:59,260","\"I like Rafiki\""]
["10:59,260","11:03,620","\"He seems like a nice guy to hang out with\""]

["11:22,540","11:25,220","\"And it's just standing there.\""]
["11:25,220","11:26,820","\"That's what would scare me.\""]
["11:26,820","11:31,100","\"Because then I would be like, \"\"Oh shit, how do I react to this? What do I do?\"\"\""]
["11:31,100","11:35,300","\"But a giant vicious thing appearing in front of you wouldn't do it.\""]
