["02:11,940","02:17,660","\"So and we'll throw in training and yeah the guy spent the whole type teaching Jaxie how to use like nodes and all this crap\""]
["02:17,660","02:23,100","\"No, they were fucking idiots also they were because they're nothing about they took away the one I paid for it\""]
["02:23,100","02:29,020","\"I don't know that anymore. They just took it back. They took it back. Yeah. Oh man. They're fucking assholes did yeah\""]
["02:29,020","02:33,500","\"Well, what they were doing is they wanted to switch all the innovators to that program so we can promote it\""]
["02:33,500","02:42,140","\"Yeah, I don't care to burn this fuck I hate that software\""]
["02:42,140","02:45,700","\"Do they get to do it they get to stop not sell it to you if you ever want it?\""]
["02:45,700","02:50,220","\"What I'm saying is this actually you know if I do make a TV show be in flash it was fucking people yeah\""]
["02:50,220","02:52,820","\"No fucking tomb boom\""]
["02:52,820","02:58,560","\"The full story was that tomb boom came to us they went we're trying to get animators on the tomb boom because no one likes\""]
["02:58,560","03:05,740","\"And we said cool can we get it for free no what you want us to buy it? Yes um\""]
["03:05,740","03:11,540","\"Why and then there is like okay, we'll give you a discount. We're like we still paid two\""]
["03:11,540","03:17,160","\"It was $300. Okay, and then they they fucking they were like okay\""]
["03:17,160","03:20,780","\"But we want to teach you tomb boom for like two weeks want to tutor you and we're like okay\""]
["03:20,780","03:25,100","\"And then the guy who did it he was just like those guys didn't know anything about animation\""]
["03:25,100","03:27,100","\"I was just not a software\""]
["03:27,100","03:32,980","\"No, I'll say this they did scam us but that\""]
["03:32,980","03:39,260","\"But the tutor himself, I just think he was so guy they put down no he was fine, but he wasn't a good teacher\""]
["03:39,260","03:42,820","\"No, that's what he was a shitty teacher, but I don't I just think he was subdued. They put that on\""]
["03:42,820","03:46,220","\"He was fine. He was a nice guy. Does Jaxxie still use tomb boom? No. Yeah\""]
["03:46,220","03:54,100","\"Yeah, everything yada does is in flash because hey easy just paying like 30 bucks or whatever a month 50\""]
["03:54,100","03:55,140","\"It's 50\""]
["03:55,140","03:57,980","\"Sweet, so it's yeah, it's gonna say it's 30 for one problem\""]
["03:57,980","04:01,780","\"It's 50 for the whole thing, but yeah, that is so much more reasonable for something you do\""]
["04:01,780","04:06,540","\"Then just like dropping what like fifteen hundred twenty five hundred dollars on tomb boom whatever the hell\""]
["04:06,540","04:11,580","\"Oh, here's something else by the way. I forgot about the fucking tube of day the version that gave us I\""]
["04:11,580","04:16,640","\"Asked somebody later. I was like, oh, yeah, we got like got like a it's called to boom harmony\""]
["04:16,640","04:21,300","\"Yeah, I was asking they're like that's not for animators. That's like a shitty new for that was a brand new version\""]
["04:21,300","04:26,880","\"They were for studios. Yeah, I mean it was a thing specifically for studios. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know if that's still true\""]
["04:26,880","04:32,180","\"I think at the time that came out people like do you see to you should be using this exact version\""]
["04:32,860","04:38,020","\"Harvard he's like the worst version to use if you let individuals go to fill up just screaming at us right now saying shut up\""]
["04:38,020","04:40,020","\"I love Adam Phillips right I I\""]
["04:40,020","04:42,780","\"Adam Phillips is one of the greatest guys no, but he loves to a boom\""]
["04:42,780","04:45,140","\"He swears by it and he's what the best animator I've ever known\""]
["04:45,140","04:50,700","\"I'm not even look I don't animate, but I'm not even trying to argue that tune boom is bad software\""]
["04:50,700","04:53,940","\"I'm just trying to say it's really expensive and I don't like the way it's marketed\""]
["04:53,940","04:57,140","\"There's what I'll say I'll say flash is much easier to teach somebody off the get go\""]
["04:57,140","05:00,300","\"That's that's a whole other thing whatever they could have but they're allowed to have a complicated program\""]
["05:00,380","05:03,940","\"Well, I guess what we're saying is like I feel like we do get cod completely\""]
["05:03,940","05:09,100","\"We basically were forced to we tricked into paying like basically\""]
["05:09,100","05:13,780","\"I think you're saying they deactivated your license. Yeah, that is kind of tan to that safety with me, too\""]
["05:13,780","05:15,980","\"Yeah, I can't use I can't use too many more\""]
["05:15,980","05:19,500","\"Yeah, I tried to open it like like a year to have gone and said you have to buy new license\""]
["05:19,500","05:22,540","\"I was like I fucking paid for it just to wrap that all the up\""]
["05:22,540","05:28,420","\"I think flash nice is a fine program to use for like TV stuff. Yeah, honestly\""]
["05:28,420","05:34,320","\"I think flash like the its only problem is that its brush kind of sucked that that's if you zoom it a little bit\""]
["05:34,320","05:37,840","\"You fix it. I know but it's still it's just kind of annoying like it's a give you a totally like it\""]
["05:37,840","05:42,000","\"It should be something that they they can fix by now. They still haven't fixed it man\""]
["05:42,000","05:46,160","\"Blender is free and you can do all the stuff. I'm gonna say I'm gonna do that\""]
["05:46,160","05:50,240","\"I wish more I love the open source community and that it\""]
["05:50,240","05:56,040","\"Especially the part of it that builds creative applications. I just know the thing\""]
["05:56,040","06:01,260","\"I like most about blender is that if you have a problem people jump to help you that's hope that's what the world of open\""]
["06:01,260","06:04,620","\"Sources, it's all community support because everyone's\""]
["06:04,620","06:11,580","\"More focused on like making this up for awesome. That's the free market to play right there. Yeah, baby. Well, it's\""]
["06:11,580","06:16,460","\"It's a component of the free market but technically no one's paying for anything\""]
["06:16,460","06:21,900","\"Nobody would say like the ability for everybody to come together like that for sure like I got a commune\""]
["06:21,900","06:28,160","\"And that's the thing and then for advanced issues a company can just sell support instead of\""]
["06:28,160","06:31,860","\"We're selling the product itself\""]
["06:31,860","06:37,540","\"Topic somebody comment through the doggy hog video that baldness is 50% jeans 50% diet\""]
["06:37,540","06:42,860","\"100% raw. It's literally 9d line point 9% genetics\""]
["06:42,860","06:47,880","\"Yeah, no, I've seen videos saying like yeah, if you eat watermelon your hair will come back you're just like dude\""]
["06:48,980","06:53,680","\"It's an efficacy thing people want to believe that they're in control of anything you could ever go wrong with\""]
["06:53,680","06:58,660","\"Listen if you the alopecia or whatever they call like like sort of like hit like hair thinness all over\""]
["06:58,660","07:02,000","\"Yeah, yeah, maybe you stop eating fucking like talk about for a meal\""]

["07:08,040","07:10,040","\"That because you really need to be fucking like\""]

["12:24,500","12:28,540","\"Touch it like look into it or to like the T-1000. Yeah, she touches you\""]
["12:28,820","12:34,460","\"Your head is 60% smaller than it is right now, but it's the exact same thing. That's very scary\""]
["12:34,460","12:38,500","\"Yeah, but would you like kill you like what you do? Would you fuck to kill yourself or just like yeah?\""]
["12:38,500","12:40,500","\"I would yeah\""]
["12:40,500","12:46,180","\"This feels a lot like your other hypothetical's that would be horrible. I would fucking asshole\""]
["12:46,180","12:50,020","\"She totally deformed your face like a raisin you could justify like okay\""]
["12:50,020","12:53,060","\"I'm so fucking deformed that like somebody could think of bird or something\""]
["12:53,060","12:57,940","\"But if she shrinks your head perfectly people can look at you go all man. He's like almost normal\""]
["12:57,940","13:00,800","\"Yeah, that's the worst thing of all. Yeah, yeah\""]
["13:00,800","13:05,160","\"He wants to do it's really like like the formula man if you like did like 15%\""]
["13:05,160","13:09,160","\"Or something different like you could be like you're like you're right on the edge. Yeah\""]
["13:09,160","13:15,680","\"It's still I think that's the worst kind of deformity. I'm trying to think that did not fucking hit me\""]
["13:15,680","13:17,680","\"What over my fucking fat Sonic head\""]
["13:17,680","13:21,000","\"but yeah, that would really piss me off like I\""]
["13:21,720","13:27,060","\"I'd like to be a ruined like you noticed things that what the fuck did he come out of?\""]
["13:27,060","13:29,480","\"Is that what that thing from the show is based on that?\""]
["13:29,480","13:35,760","\"Remember that guy? I don't know. What was it? Was it chicken? Was it actually chicken? Yeah?\""]
["13:35,760","13:37,760","\"He's like the guy from the show\""]
["13:37,760","13:41,300","\"Look at that. Oh that might be what he's based on actually\""]
["13:41,300","13:47,400","\"That makes sense. He's a guy in a later level that looks exactly like the green guy the green guy\""]
["13:47,400","13:49,400","\"Yeah, he's just a normal level in your hands\""]
["13:50,080","13:57,780","\"Yeah, oh my god, but uh, no yet like people notice things that are like like my nose is 2% too big and it ruins my day\""]
["13:57,780","14:01,080","\"Yeah, yeah like 60% that would destroy you\""]
["14:01,080","14:05,220","\"You know, I really I really know 60% really do fucking live\""]
["14:05,220","14:10,360","\"Yeah, but I think that's such a deformity that you did you get so like shocked by it first\""]
["14:10,360","14:11,440","\"You get used to it afterwards\""]
["14:11,440","14:17,600","\"Yeah, cuz if something's like slightly like if you like cuz if you're left I became like like 4% larger\""]
["14:18,040","14:21,200","\"That body you more than if he came yeah\""]
["14:21,200","14:27,880","\"That body more than if it became like like 50% larger because if it's 50% larger you know you're free\""]
["14:27,880","14:30,520","\"Yeah, but if it's 4% larger like people\""]
["14:30,520","14:35,320","\"Conceivably will like look you go what the fuck is off? So I was off like slightly off about this guy\""]
["14:35,320","14:38,580","\"Yeah, no that would act that would actually make me very sad\""]
["14:38,580","14:46,280","\"60% that's actually like that's scaring me to think about it. That's like that's like the guy from how it's done\""]
["14:46,280","14:50,480","\"That's like Beetlejuice that guy with the little shrunken head that's worse than him. Yeah. Yeah, no, it would be you know\""]
["14:50,480","14:54,920","\"You're right. Yeah, it's like probably it would be like the literal shrunken head guy from the movie Beetlejuice\""]
["14:54,920","15:00,220","\"The guy sitting in the waiting room. What should which I know what he's talking about. Yeah, you know in the waiting room\""]
["15:00,220","15:02,220","\"When they first get to like purgatory\""]
["15:02,220","15:05,260","\"What yeah\""]
["15:05,260","15:10,160","\"Awesome everybody the artist just spat out their fucking Doritos right there\""]

["15:13,240","15:16,140","\"You're talking about flight of the navigation\""]
["15:16,140","15:25,900","\"It's old there's no fucking point to the movie there is a point he learns to accept that he's\""]
["15:25,900","15:33,120","\"Pointless movie ever. I that's that's a horrifying concept that your whole family grows 10 years without you and you're left in the dirt\""]
["15:33,120","15:39,660","\"There's a little boy - yeah, so his little brother is like 10 years older than he is now and he's an anime like that about a girl\""]
["15:39,660","15:40,240","\"who\""]
["15:40,240","15:43,100","\"Goes into like this like space-time warp and then\""]
["15:43,100","15:50,500","\"All her she comes back and she's still like a 16 year old girl and everybody else is like 60\""]
["15:50,500","15:54,840","\"Yeah, it was called gun bust. Why did why did she still 60 would happen to her?\""]
["15:54,840","15:58,960","\"She she went on this mission in space to go fight these\""]
["15:58,960","16:01,880","\"Evil aliens that lived on the other side of the universe\""]

["16:08,000","16:10,580","\"Sort of stood still for her, but it still took her like\""]
["16:10,580","16:12,560","\"Many years to get there.\""]
["16:12,560","16:14,060","\"- Sounds like I like our satanic physics or something.\""]
["16:14,060","16:16,000","\"- No, I think this is actually like our insta-\""]

["16:17,720","16:18,880","\"(chuckles)\""]
["16:18,880","16:21,640","\"- Yeah, the closer you get to like the more--\""]
["16:21,640","16:23,160","\"- The more time contracts.\""]
["16:23,160","16:24,000","\"- Dilates for you, yeah.\""]
["16:24,000","16:25,720","\"- Or dilates, yeah.\""]
["16:25,720","16:26,560","\"- Look at that guy.\""]
["16:26,560","16:27,880","\"- That's why if you say,\""]

["16:35,840","16:37,840","\"Um\""]
["16:37,840","16:42,760","\"Actually, do you know the astronauts are actually like like like like four seconds younger than the rest of earth?\""]
["16:42,760","16:46,960","\"Yeah, it's kind of fucked up. I mean I think I think\""]
["16:46,960","16:54,520","\"GPS's have to have little things it constantly correct because there's ever so slightly slower in them really yeah\""]
["16:54,520","16:57,360","\"Cuz they're they're further away from gravity the more gravity you have\""]
["16:57,360","17:02,120","\"I mean, I'm not a fucking physicist. I'm not gonna go into this because I'm not even that great explain it\""]
["17:02,120","17:05,280","\"And I hardly understand it is every single\""]
["17:05,280","17:09,300","\"like clock slightly out of sync with each other like is there any clock that's\""]
["17:09,300","17:15,680","\"exactly spawn onto another clock I mean so I mean it comes damn close so you know\""]
["17:15,680","17:21,000","\"about how the atomic clocks work right no like they measure time in like the\""]
["17:21,000","17:26,220","\"one of the most precise ways possible which is like I don't remember what kind\""]
["17:26,220","17:30,780","\"of atom it is but essentially it it monitors the decay of an atom which is\""]
["17:30,780","17:33,400","\"something that happens in like a perfect,\""]

["17:36,860","17:37,860","\"- Yeah.\""]
["17:37,860","17:41,420","\"- And so it's accurate up to like some tiny like,\""]

["17:45,100","17:45,940","\"- There you go.\""]

["17:51,740","17:53,100","\"This game fucking sucks.\""]

["17:56,580","17:57,860","\"none of this is fun.\""]
["17:57,860","18:00,460","\"- I would say Sonic 2 definitely like improves\""]

["18:05,180","18:10,980","\"out of me. That's actually really good. That's the OG video game jumpscare. I\""]

["18:54,380","19:00,040","\"I think it's really clear that it's it's the result of consuming popular culture and like things like\""]
["19:00,040","19:03,040","\"You say you became a furry like when you shot like a little fat\""]

["19:50,760","19:53,760","\"That would be an alternate timeline maybe but\""]
["19:53,760","20:01,280","\"Did that video just come from him doing that impression in a different video and I think he was so good that he made his own video\""]

["20:18,040","20:21,900","\"I'll tell you why I think that that's what happened because there is there is proof that there's like a video\""]
["20:21,900","20:26,880","\"They came like two weeks before the video came out. No. Yeah, it was him reviewing the Mario DVD\""]
["20:26,880","20:31,140","\"Man, yeah, yeah, yeah, so they obviously did it there. It was like oh, it's really funny\""]
