["07:58,580","07:59,420","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:59,420","08:04,300","\"- I mean, what if I perceive something as being old\""]

["08:33,220","08:36,100","\"- Only year. You have it, it's yours.\""]
["08:36,100","08:39,180","\"Oh, what about music?\""]
["08:39,180","08:41,300","\"- Just the fact that the Smithsonian\""]
["08:41,300","08:42,580","\"is not going to have anything\""]
["08:42,580","08:44,740","\"that isn't historically significant.\""]

["08:46,860","08:49,140","\"in like 100 years, you just did,\""]
["08:49,140","08:51,060","\"you were like the president, let's say,\""]
["08:51,060","08:54,940","\"and you did every important major thing\""]
["08:54,940","08:58,140","\"with like a big old dildo in your butt?\""]
["08:58,140","09:01,220","\"And so the Smithsonian would have to display it.\""]
["09:01,220","09:04,300","\"Like whatever your most proud accomplishment was,\""]
["09:04,300","09:06,380","\"at the end of the speech, you just pull the dildo\""]
["09:06,380","09:08,980","\"out of your butt and just like, hold it up\""]
["09:08,980","09:10,300","\"so everyone can see it.\""]
["09:10,300","09:12,540","\"It's like, yeah, take a look, take a look.\""]
["09:12,540","09:14,820","\"- This is gonna be an important historic art.\""]

["09:33,660","09:36,560","\"Smithsonian\""]
["09:36,560","09:40,900","\"Write this down and then they have to put it in there and everybody has to look at it\""]
["09:40,900","09:47,100","\"Just as is they don't wash it off or anything either because that would ruin the historical significance\""]
["09:47,100","09:51,500","\"It's gonna say you can't clean something like that. Yeah, exactly. Yes, I believe it as it\""]
["09:51,500","09:55,580","\"It's like it's like taking a brush to the Mona Lisa, you know, you just don't do it\""]
