["00:23,500","00:24,500","\"'Cause you're slimy.\""]
["00:24,500","00:25,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:25,500","00:27,800","\"I think I'm getting a little bit more comfortable with the pairing.\""]
["00:27,800","00:28,800","\"With the slime?\""]
["00:28,800","00:34,000","\"You know Nick, how come you always smell kind of like fermented yeast?\""]
["00:34,000","00:38,400","\"Yeah, Mick, tell us about your yeast. Is your yeast the source of your slime?\""]
["00:38,400","00:43,280","\"Yes, it's tasty feast upon my yeast\""]
["00:43,280","00:49,240","\"Get over here. Show me what let's mix super villain catch phrase\""]
["00:49,240","00:52,240","\"feast upon my yeast\""]
["00:53,080","00:59,600","\"Feast upon my yeast and I take my pants down and then you're saying get me a priest take a whiff of this shit\""]
["00:59,600","01:04,800","\"You shouldn't ask people to feast upon your yeast mick why?\""]
["01:04,800","01:09,300","\"Because it's not healthy. The yeast is bad for you. Absolutely should you know?\""]
["01:09,300","01:15,680","\"Beat to their benefit yeast is bad for what humans oh humans what you eat bread all the time where I know it's bad for you\""]
["01:15,680","01:19,500","\"Not saying it's good for you. I'm just saying I eat it\""]
["01:19,560","01:25,360","\"They so like the way bread used to be made before people understood what yeast was\""]
["01:25,360","01:30,560","\"They didn't actually use yeast it would just be like whatever random bacteria\""]
["01:30,560","01:36,480","\"Happened to like form in the in the like bread because they'd leave it out for like a few days really wow\""]
["01:36,480","01:40,000","\"Yeah, that's really interesting. I think it is interesting\""]
["01:40,000","01:48,600","\"That is interesting. That is a D-hole god D-hole. Aren't you used to do you know what that is a dopamine hole? Yeah\""]
["01:49,160","01:55,860","\"Correct a dark hole. Yes sourdough is one of the few breads that actually was like developed that way initially\""]
["01:55,860","02:01,020","\"Like they didn't know what use they were using no like like sourdough was something that did just like form\""]
["02:01,020","02:06,940","\"And the way you keep it going once it forms is you just take a little piece of the dough and set it aside\""]
["02:06,940","02:14,040","\"And then you keep like peat picking off pieces of that so you basically transfer the bacteria from it into your new\""]
["02:14,040","02:16,480","\"dough each time\""]
["02:16,680","02:20,580","\"So every time you make a new dough you let it rise the bacteria\""]
["02:20,580","02:26,280","\"Multiplies and then you can keep a piece of it and set it aside for your next loaf. Oh, yeah, that's right. They do that with yogurt. Yeah\""]
["02:26,280","02:42,960","\"Exactly Dark Souls one where you had that thing up on the bridge remember. Yeah, I bet his fire could bake so much bread\""]
["02:45,160","02:47,340","\"This is just gonna be Dark Souls bread\""]
["02:47,340","02:52,840","\"Thank you, I would probably buy bread if it had Dark Souls written on it\""]
["02:52,840","02:58,620","\"Hell yeah, go into Yamazaki Bakery, and it's just a loaf of bread. This is from software\""]
["02:58,620","03:03,660","\"Holy shit\""]
["03:03,660","03:08,640","\"Good timing, Nick. What are you doing? Yeah, how many how many loaves am I how many loaves?\""]
["03:08,640","03:10,640","\"I got turned into bread\""]
["03:11,280","03:17,840","\"If you had a lot of what is it that turns it's dough, right? The yeast is just the thing that kind of helps\""]
["03:17,840","03:19,560","\"What?\""]
["03:19,560","03:20,280","\"Raisins?\""]
["03:20,280","03:20,800","\"The dough?\""]
["03:20,800","03:26,900","\"Yeah, all the rising, everything that makes bread soft and fluffy comes from the\""]
["03:26,900","03:30,980","\"the bacteria inside it, right? Because it's respirating\""]
["03:30,980","03:36,680","\"Well, then how do they make sure that it's only unharmedful bacteria?\""]
["03:36,680","03:40,800","\"I mean, if you know what yeast went into it\""]
["03:40,800","03:47,120","\"You know, it's not harmful. Oh, thank God. I want to make bread. You know what? I think bread is delicious\""]
["03:47,120","03:49,120","\"It's really nice to bake your own bread\""]
["03:49,120","03:53,600","\"I've never done it. I have a bread maker, so I don't have to do all the actual hard work\""]
