["00:14,160","00:17,440","\"\"\"Alright, I gotta- I gotta hypothetical for you guys. Let's say, uh...\"\"\""]
["00:17,440","00:18,560","\"\"\"Go Daddy, go.\"\"\""]

["00:26,440","00:29,960","\"Alright, so he doesn't give you like a numerical number of wishes.\""]
["00:29,960","00:35,240","\"Basically, you get as many wishes as you want, but every time you make one, you get a year older,\""]
["00:35,240","00:39,480","\"and you can't make any kind of wish that like improves your health or undoes that.\""]
["00:39,480","00:40,440","\"- Okay.\""]
["00:40,440","00:44,680","\"- So like basically it just shaves a year off of your life starting currently.\""]
["00:44,680","00:48,200","\"- So what would be my new life plan if it suddenly took this turn?\""]
["00:48,200","00:49,160","\"- Basically, yeah.\""]
["00:49,160","00:49,640","\"- Okay.\""]

["00:52,040","00:53,240","\"- I don't care if I age a little bit.\""]
["00:53,240","00:59,560","\"I think we would all at least like get ourselves into into our 30s right like yeah, you could probably mark in my third\""]
["00:59,560","01:01,720","\"Yeah, well, okay\""]
["01:01,720","01:06,720","\"So basically basically how many wishes would it take for me to become Tomar?\""]
["01:06,720","01:10,720","\"Can I be an asshole one and I'd say I would just make a let's say I want to be Tomo\""]
["01:10,720","01:17,760","\"Oh shoot the ball just make one really good big-ass wish like wish for some stupid amount of like\""]
["01:18,320","01:24,880","\"Yeah, I've always wondered about the wishing for money because it's like what's all the legal red tape behind like if a genie made you\""]
["01:24,880","01:28,160","\"Like a million dollars in like non-consecutive bills\""]
["01:28,160","01:31,320","\"Like couldn't that still be traced to being counterfeit?\""]
["01:31,320","01:37,080","\"Yeah, probably like again if it couldn't be traced to being counterfeit it would have to come from somewhere, right?\""]
["01:37,080","01:42,720","\"I need a circumstance where where I just like wind up in a situation where I can make a lot of money\""]
["01:42,720","01:43,720","\"I guess yeah\""]
["01:43,720","01:47,220","\"I would say I would say if you're shaving a year off your life\""]
["01:47,220","01:51,700","\"Don't make a money wish because you can just wish for something that can make you a lot of money\""]
["01:51,700","01:54,020","\"Can I can I be a prick and be like yo?\""]
["01:54,020","01:57,240","\"I know I'm gonna be 35, but can you make me look like I'm 18?\""]
["01:57,240","02:02,180","\"I feel like that goes against the that the ruleset\""]
["02:02,180","02:04,980","\"What if my innards are still like\""]
["02:04,980","02:09,880","\"Kind of the point of why I said you couldn't like wish yourself younger was just but I'm not you know\""]

["02:16,760","02:23,880","\"Okay, it's a cop and I won't do it. I won't do it just cuz Tomar said it's a cop out. Thank you\""]
["02:23,880","02:27,400","\"I would wish for\""]
["02:27,400","02:32,880","\"The dukes archives from Dark Souls to fall into the center of Manhattan\""]
["02:32,880","02:38,820","\"Just because you want to do it. That's basically terrorists attack you\""]
["02:38,820","02:42,280","\"Would cost mass devastation\""]
["02:42,280","02:49,640","\"It'd be funny though local Irishman wishes for dukes archives to kill a million people in Manhattan\""]
["02:49,640","02:55,560","\"I would I would instead of wishing for money what I would do is I would wish just to slip directly\""]
["02:55,560","02:56,400","\"into you\""]
["02:56,400","03:09,320","\"I wish to to step directly into Jeff Bezos's life like I want his wife I want to stay directly\""]

["03:23,160","03:25,840","\"and stuff, but all of a sudden he just wakes up in my bed\""]
["03:25,840","03:28,200","\"and I'm him and I've got all his money.\""]
["03:28,200","03:30,080","\"- And no one will believe him when he claims this.\""]

["03:44,200","03:48,960","\"acknowledge that that's what happens and so he knows that he's not crazy yeah but\""]
["03:48,960","03:55,280","\"I just want to psychologically torment and rob you. Yeah what's your problem\""]

["03:59,360","04:07,400","\"I'd wish that Lyle's head and limbs with could not extend the base of each way what\""]
["04:07,400","04:12,780","\"I would wish that your like hands and feet and head could not be wider than the base of them\""]
["04:12,780","04:15,500","\"Okay, I mean that would take a year off your life\""]
["04:15,500","04:21,500","\"Still having trouble visualizing be like they don't be like they don't turn into a smaller size\""]
["04:21,500","04:24,520","\"You look like a weird pin starfish guy\""]
["04:24,520","04:32,740","\"So so like the like his wrist like his whole hand would be the width of his wrist. Yeah, can I still be Jeff Bezos if I?\""]
["04:33,200","04:36,640","\"I'm like I'm this weird so Jeff be like a playmobilecare\""]
["04:36,640","04:42,320","\"Bezos is being like tormented by this weird stubby man and\""]
["04:42,320","04:48,280","\"Then I went back his ex-wife and get custody of the kids and do what he could not then\""]
["04:48,280","04:51,480","\"I would wish that your treasure trail was changed into a little staircase\""]
["04:51,480","04:55,000","\"Staircase to my dick. Yeah, and that uh\""]
["04:55,000","05:03,040","\"From your dick depending on how you look at there's three staircases the middle one is for humans and the right and left ones\""]
["05:03,040","05:04,040","\"are for giants.\""]
["05:04,040","05:06,960","\"So I'm actually did just bring up like a really compelling point.\""]
["05:06,960","05:09,320","\"What is the direction of a human?\""]
["05:09,320","05:10,320","\"The direction?\""]
["05:10,320","05:11,320","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:11,320","05:12,320","\"I can't tell.\""]
["05:12,320","05:13,320","\"Right?\""]
["05:13,320","05:15,480","\"Because technically we're like, we used to be on all fours.\""]
["05:15,480","05:22,420","\"Gravity would make you think that the direction is up, but that is like, that could conceivably\""]
["05:22,420","05:23,680","\"be the base, right?\""]
["05:23,680","05:29,720","\"I think there was a chapter in the original Phantom Toll booth about people, like a society\""]
["05:29,720","05:31,520","\"where people grow down.\""]
["05:31,520","05:36,000","\"You're literally born and you're like floating up in the air and your legs just like slowly\""]
["05:36,000","05:42,800","\"Okay, mine is like the physical aspect of that that is kind of how it works right because babies are super top-heavy\""]
["05:42,800","05:48,000","\"And they have like stupid big heads they're super tight and then the legs and arms sort of grow down out from that\""]
["05:48,000","05:50,000","\"Oh, I guess that's like that's a good point\""]
["05:50,000","05:52,640","\"Okay, so by the way you can oh\""]
["05:52,640","05:58,400","\"See that shit. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, so you can you can't hit people\""]
["05:58,400","06:00,400","\"I\""]
["06:00,400","06:06,880","\"Came activating that by accident. I don't mean that the phantom told I can't remember what book that was for all\""]
["06:06,880","06:11,720","\"I know that was in fucking wrinkle in time. You just shot his hair piece off. I sure did now\""]
["06:11,720","06:14,320","\"He's bald forever. It's amazing. He's evil forever\""]
["06:14,320","06:19,000","\"A wrinkle in time is the best film I've ever seen. It is not\""]
["06:19,000","06:24,400","\"It's pretty funny when Oprah shows up and she says I had too much money for this darling\""]
["06:24,400","06:27,100","\"She does not sound like a typical black woman.\""]
["06:27,100","06:30,200","\"I haven't fucking watched Oprah in ever, so...\""]
["06:30,200","06:35,840","\"My favorite part is when the little girl has the one scene where Oprah is actually on set\""]
["06:35,840","06:41,900","\"and not a green screen behind everybody, and she goes, \"\"You're all so beautiful!\"\"\""]
["06:41,900","06:47,400","\"Just as like a non sequitur after Oprah saves her from falling off a ledge.\""]
["06:47,400","06:51,200","\"If you want to remember what Oprah sounds like, just imagine the clip of her being like,\""]
["06:51,200","06:56,160","\"4chan have over 9000 penises and they're all being children 9000 penises. Yeah\""]
["06:56,160","07:03,880","\"Whoa, I was a kid that guy with a meat is wait. Is that meat? Yeah, I think that's like a chunk of another dude that got blown up\""]
["07:03,880","07:10,120","\"I don't think it's that gory. No, I is about a butcher. I definitely like blew up a guy earlier\""]
["07:10,120","07:14,080","\"Oh really? That's what what that is that oh, yeah, you can use those yes\""]
["07:18,720","07:25,240","\"So cool fuck these guys. I don't think those are gonna hit him just shoot him\""]
["07:25,240","07:31,040","\"Oh\""]
["07:31,040","07:47,300","\"This is sick marvelous bitch shit\""]
["07:47,300","07:49,300","\"No, I\""]
["07:49,300","07:51,460","\"Kind of wish you could bring the frying pan with you now\""]
["07:51,460","07:55,220","\"Yeah, that would be maybe you can maybe you can kick it around with you\""]
["07:55,220","07:57,820","\"Maybe it'll do maybe it just always stays in that one place\""]
["07:57,820","08:00,460","\"You can definitely like if I really wanted to do that\""]
["08:00,460","08:07,340","\"I could probably just kick it and keep it trailing me, but I I'm not that dedicated. I feel you homie I\""]
["08:07,340","08:12,320","\"Say as I totally actually nail it and I'm probably gonna bring it with me do it\""]
["08:12,320","08:15,420","\"Look at that. Yes, you got it stuck in the wood\""]
["08:16,100","08:20,080","\"Nothing is ever stuck in the wood Chris. It's only there temporarily. Okay\""]
["08:20,080","08:24,220","\"What show man I don't feel bad feeling about those red lines\""]
["08:24,220","08:28,300","\"I wonder what they symbolize\""]
["08:28,300","08:34,540","\"I'm probably putting a disproportionate amount of effort into no I should have done that\""]
["08:34,540","08:38,840","\"I think you're supposed to crawl into that tape. I absolutely was all right. I hope this doesn't just\""]

["10:37,040","10:40,000","\"Is there like a looping casino in the background? Yeah, yeah\""]
