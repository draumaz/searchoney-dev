["01:55,300","01:59,520","\"I'm saying in the real world it would be different because in Pokemon you got bullshit science, but in the real world\""]
["01:59,520","02:04,460","\"It would be a lot more difficult when you're changing the rules of Pokemon Chris. Okay fine in the real world\""]
["02:04,460","02:06,460","\"Then you could afford pokeball. Okay fine\""]
["02:06,460","02:13,140","\"Carrying it more than one pokeball around would be hindrance. Okay. Well, they shrink now. You're just being whiny\""]

["02:31:38,260","02:31:40,660","\"I found out about it because it was in the C drive.\""]
["02:31:40,660","02:31:42,580","\"And you could access it through the browser.\""]
["02:31:42,580","02:31:43,420","\"- Wow.\""]
["02:31:43,420","02:31:45,140","\"- And they were taking screenshots of everyone's computer\""]

["02:31:47,180","02:31:49,700","\"It was tracking every key stroke you made.\""]
["02:31:49,700","02:31:52,060","\"And they were just monitoring kids like actively,\""]

["02:31:53,060","02:31:54,860","\"- And that system got taken advantage of.\""]
["02:31:54,860","02:31:56,780","\"- Yeah, that's what happened is that a bunch of kids\""]
["02:31:56,780","02:31:58,940","\"found out about it and they started going in\""]
["02:31:58,940","02:32:02,380","\"and messing with kids like email accounts and everything.\""]
["02:32:02,380","02:32:05,300","\"And the fact that they had a key logger running already,\""]
["02:32:05,300","02:32:07,460","\"like that's probably why they suspended the kids.\""]

["02:32:08,840","02:32:11,740","\"that's not a legal thing to do, but they did it anyways.\""]
["02:32:11,740","02:32:13,500","\"We had lots of stuff like that always happening\""]

["02:32:32,700","02:32:36,900","\"but like when I think our generation was growing up,\""]
["02:32:36,900","02:32:40,380","\"You kind of assumed that adults didn't know how to use computers, yeah?\""]

["02:33:09,540","02:33:12,900","\"They were able to get their direct information off of that if they wanted to\""]

["02:36:19,580","02:36:24,420","\"at school the entire day to the point that my mom even showed up and was saying like\""]
["02:36:24,420","02:36:29,960","\"He's coming home with me. He's not staying here for this because they thought they heard me say a swear in the hallway\""]
["02:36:29,960","02:36:35,520","\"that I didn't say and I didn't even know why I was in trouble and they were trying to get me to like admit it the whole time\""]
["02:36:35,520","02:36:37,360","\"So I had no idea what was even going on\""]
["02:36:37,360","02:36:42,320","\"Yeah, and I think I was kept until like 4 30 or something like it was a few hours after school had ended\""]
["02:36:42,320","02:36:44,800","\"Until finally like I just got pulled out of there\""]
["02:36:44,800","02:36:50,220","\"But that was that's why I wish I had fun stories. This is the the stuff that always happened\""]
["02:36:50,220","02:36:55,580","\"And we had a, in middle school there was a kid who smeared his shit across all the\""]

["02:37:00,380","02:37:03,260","\"The whole school got called together and like the auditorium about it.\""]
["02:37:03,260","02:37:04,260","\"- So he told me that before?\""]
["02:37:04,260","02:37:07,180","\"- Yeah, and then he pulled the fire alarm so everyone just left.\""]
["02:37:07,180","02:37:08,780","\"But stuff like that was always happening.\""]
["02:37:08,780","02:37:13,660","\"Like everybody there, it just felt like it was just constant chaos.\""]
["02:37:13,660","02:37:17,380","\"- I had a guy in my school who pissed his pants just because someone told him to.\""]
["02:37:17,380","02:37:20,780","\"You're like you should piss yourself. He's like okay. He did it\""]
["02:37:20,780","02:37:26,340","\"Wow, it's real funny. He's also the same guy. He wrote his name on the toilet with shit\""]
["02:37:26,340","02:37:31,500","\"I mean kids would do dumb stuff like that too. Yeah, just because it's like yo\""]
["02:37:31,500","02:37:36,900","\"This music to that visuals hilarious. Yeah, what him smearing a shit around\""]
["02:37:36,900","02:37:42,780","\"Really upbeat music and then that is the shit falling back in the toilet teacher catching him. He's running away\""]

["02:37:47,740","02:37:54,240","\"That's them screaming at him punching him on the head and now the teacher wins\""]
["02:37:54,240","02:37:57,880","\"The child's been knocked out. Oh no, he's back\""]
["02:37:57,880","02:38:04,700","\"What was like what's the most trouble someone at your school got him?\""]
["02:38:04,700","02:38:12,020","\"My friend my best friend for the first three years he used to get in trouble every day\""]

["02:38:14,940","02:38:20,540","\"I don't know like you know what I also had three people in my class all called Steven and they were the worst in the class\""]

["02:38:23,960","02:38:28,460","\"Do what I think I yeah, he was the science teacher for my first year\""]

["02:38:34,420","02:38:35,820","\"But he just got in trouble a lot\""]
["02:38:35,820","02:38:42,300","\"But the teacher was so brutally mean to him that one time he started shaking in his face turn like blood red\""]
["02:38:42,300","02:38:46,380","\"Like really dark red and the teacher was like making fun of him while this was happening\""]
["02:38:46,380","02:38:52,400","\"And then I think Steven said something along the lines of I hope your house burns to the ground or something like that\""]
["02:38:52,400","02:38:55,820","\"And I shit you not that year his house burned to the ground. Oh my god\""]
["02:38:55,820","02:38:59,780","\"Yeah, no, he didn't do it. It was because the teacher was an alcoholic\""]
["02:38:59,780","02:39:03,020","\"Oh, and he just like fell asleep with the oven on or something\""]
["02:39:03,020","02:39:11,120","\"There is justice sometimes I remember a bunch of kids in class thought it was really funny to hold your breath until you passed out\""]

["02:39:30,620","02:39:34,060","\"You should not be trying to just pass out for no reason just for fun\""]
["02:39:34,060","02:39:40,600","\"There's a weird like sad truth that I'd say 10% of teachers really want to help kids\""]
["02:39:40,600","02:39:44,160","\"and the other 90% are just failures who are stuck in that job.\""]
["02:39:44,160","02:39:44,820","\"Probably.\""]

["02:39:59,920","02:40:02,120","\"because of the new Undertale thing?\""]
["02:40:02,120","02:40:03,120","\"What?\""]
["02:40:03,120","02:40:06,880","\"How you said that you had a teacher that was looking at porn in class?\""]
["02:40:06,880","02:40:09,760","\"That was different, but that one was pretty bad too.\""]
["02:40:09,760","02:40:15,420","\"Boy that one was pretty bad too. I know lots of stuff. They lied to us that 9/11 didn't happen\""]
["02:40:15,420","02:40:17,280","\"I remember that was a thing. Mm-hmm\""]
["02:40:17,280","02:40:22,260","\"They told everybody for like two months straight that it wasn't real because I didn't want the kids to be upset\""]
["02:40:22,260","02:40:24,260","\"That's kind of funny, but not really\""]
["02:40:24,260","02:40:30,820","\"Jesus I have a serious serious appreciation for teachers who actually care\""]
["02:40:30,820","02:40:36,300","\"You really appreciate you remember them for the rest of your life\""]

["02:41:27,220","02:41:31,140","\"We had a technology course and the idea was that\""]
["02:41:31,140","02:41:32,620","\"we had to learn how to use Perl,\""]
["02:41:32,620","02:41:34,740","\"which is like a command line thing that you have to do\""]
["02:41:34,740","02:41:37,340","\"for networking, like if you want to get into a FTP,\""]

["02:41:43,140","02:41:45,300","\"- I don't know how to really explain it\""]
["02:41:45,300","02:41:46,580","\"in a way that would make too much sense,\""]
["02:41:46,580","02:41:48,740","\"but it was a thing that we were supposed to learn\""]
["02:41:48,740","02:41:52,220","\"just for the sake of uploading files to the school system.\""]
["02:41:52,220","02:41:54,860","\"And we did not get taught how to actually do it.\""]
["02:41:54,860","02:41:56,700","\"We got told that we had to do it,\""]
["02:41:56,700","02:41:59,100","\"but he said nothing to us about it.\""]
["02:41:59,100","02:42:00,820","\"It wasn't in the book or anything either.\""]
["02:42:00,820","02:42:03,100","\"He just expected us to do it.\""]
["02:42:03,100","02:42:08,620","\"And what ended up happening was that I ended up just finding that he had the file uploaded already,\""]
["02:42:08,620","02:42:12,640","\"and I hate saying this. I'm sorry I'm admitting this, but it's what ended up happening.\""]

["02:42:21,100","02:42:25,980","\"so they could re-upload it, and I showed them how to use Pearl because he wasn't teaching anybody how to do it.\""]
