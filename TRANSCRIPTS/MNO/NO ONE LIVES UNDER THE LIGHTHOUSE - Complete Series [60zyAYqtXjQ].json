["00:09,880","00:12,680","\"I'm down with dads and no one lives under this thing.\""]

["00:23,760","00:27,840","\"Uh, you don't want to be mean to the creator of this game, dude.\""]
["00:27,840","00:29,280","\"They're kind of crazy.\""]
["00:29,280","00:37,040","\"kind of psycho. Okay, we'll see. No, I'm kidding. I don't know who they are. I'm sorry. It was a joke.\""]
["00:37,040","00:44,800","\"Have you? Oh, that's a guy. Oh, that's cool. Oh, that's sick.\""]
["00:44,800","00:51,360","\"I don't like it. Oh, that was I like this already.\""]
["00:53,200","00:56,080","\"Oh, it's a guest. There's nothing down here.\""]
["00:56,080","01:00,880","\"I like it just started like pretty quickly, huh? Yeah, it was pretty neat.\""]
["01:00,880","01:08,880","\"All right. Well, I felt the little oil thing. Let's see if we can do something about this whole lighthouse deal.\""]
["01:08,880","01:14,000","\"You love holes. Oh, he's a guest. Oh, I can't even answer the door.\""]
["01:14,000","01:19,200","\"Oh, is that what that was? Was someone banging on the door? Yeah, it was the guy you just saw.\""]
["01:22,240","01:33,280","\"Oh wow this is cool. I do that sick. I like shitty old graphics. Yeah no I think it does add a lot to the the weird suspense.\""]
["01:33,280","01:41,920","\"What song is that?\""]
["01:49,920","01:51,920","\"This is what powers the lighthouse.\""]
["01:51,920","01:54,760","\"This pulley system.\""]
["01:54,760","01:56,960","\"This is gravity to turn the little light.\""]
["01:56,960","02:00,000","\"Is that actually how they worked?\""]
["02:00,000","02:02,840","\"I have no idea, but I wouldn't be surprised.\""]
["02:02,840","02:06,160","\"Oh, yeah. Like a grandfather clock kind of thing.\""]
["02:06,160","02:07,960","\"Yeah, it's like winding up a clock.\""]
["02:07,960","02:11,320","\"OK. Oh, how long would that go for?\""]
["02:11,320","02:12,360","\"Just a whole night.\""]
["02:12,360","02:14,040","\"I guess that's the idea.\""]
["02:14,040","02:16,080","\"That's cool.\""]
["02:16,080","02:19,360","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["02:19,360","02:20,960","\"You have to just power the lighthouse.\""]
["02:20,960","02:23,600","\"Yeah, you just put oil in it and it turns the light on.\""]
["02:23,600","02:25,940","\"Wow.\""]
["02:25,940","02:27,040","\"Day one is defeated.\""]
["02:27,040","02:32,480","\"This was just like the kind of intro.\""]
["02:32,480","02:33,720","\"Okay.\""]
["02:33,720","02:38,200","\"That's pretty rad, honestly.\""]
["02:38,200","02:45,600","\"So is that the objective of the game allegedly?\""]
["02:45,600","02:48,760","\"You're just a humble lighthouse operator.\""]
["02:49,200","02:50,040","\"I think so.\""]
["02:50,040","02:51,880","\"Mm-mm.\""]

["03:13,360","03:16,040","\"There's no one on the island.\""]
["03:16,040","03:18,640","\"I don't think he ran away, dude.\""]
["03:18,640","03:21,040","\"I think instead a haunt might have occurred.\""]

["04:32,000","04:35,640","\"- So how inspired by this is the lighthouse?\""]
["04:35,640","04:37,920","\"I mean, how inspired from the lighthouse is this?\""]
["04:37,920","04:40,960","\"- I think they openly say in the game description\""]
["04:40,960","04:43,440","\"that it's very much based on the lighthouse.\""]

["08:42,900","08:47,780","\"You know nothing about Newton's third law. I don't know that's all bouncing words\""]
["08:47,780","08:54,500","\"An object in motion stays in motion and has an equal to opposite reaction\""]
["08:54,860","09:00,460","\"No, it would have been a stage in motion if it's covered in low gravity's acting against it the whole time\""]
["09:00,460","09:03,180","\"So it would bounce lower with each successive bounce\""]
["09:03,180","09:07,980","\"You could never bounce all the way up to your starting point listen smartass\""]
["09:07,980","09:12,300","\"Just fill up the the canister and then we'll see what bounced back up\""]

["11:43,980","11:50,740","\"I wouldn't clean up this stuff just because like the guy wasn't up front. He didn't say a guy got murdered and all that other crap\""]
["11:50,740","11:55,240","\"He's a lot. He implied it. Look at all these birdies gathered around\""]
["11:55,240","11:57,700","\"They're gathered around that sandbag\""]
["11:57,700","12:01,180","\"They can't do that\""]

["12:35,380","12:38,380","\"I can go put that in my little chest at least.\""]
["12:38,380","12:42,780","\"Oh, yeah, he'll just get really labored breath if I keep running\""]
["12:42,780","12:46,340","\"Is that a thing to your laughter was that just a tree?\""]
["12:46,340","12:53,780","\"I think that's the thing like everything in this game the low-poly weird like like the fact that these things are just like\""]
["12:53,780","12:58,980","\"2d meshes and you just sometimes see him at weird angles and they play tricks on your eyes\""]
["12:58,980","13:04,260","\"Can you go into that little shed that the seagulls were hanging out with yeah? I was in there at the beginning remember\""]
["13:04,900","13:11,460","\"It just had like some random tools and shit in it, which I don't know. Yeah, but you're not gonna check it out after the seagulls hang out on it\""]
["13:11,460","13:16,700","\"I mean I might have to but first I'm gonna put this in my little chest. All right\""]
["13:16,700","13:19,500","\"thorough as ever\""]
["13:29,340","13:34,920","\"All right. Oh, yeah, that's right. There's no shit bucket because he's got this crappy doorless outhouse\""]
["13:34,920","13:42,460","\"I would love to shit in there. We can imagine that just being all by yourself on an island and being able to just shit and look out\""]

["13:56,300","14:00,700","\"Go check out that uh that thing is there actually like a time system in this game?\""]
["14:00,700","14:07,160","\"I don't think so like I said I think it's event based okay, so maybe I am supposed to check out something in that\""]
["14:07,160","14:09,060","\"That's a lot if you ask him that again\""]

["27:08,440","27:13,540","\"I don't even know if that does anything yet. I don't either honestly. It just makes me feel better\""]
["27:13,540","27:17,200","\"Why you're not even Christian. Yeah, but\""]
["27:17,200","27:20,880","\"But you are who made this game is likely to be\""]
["27:20,880","27:29,720","\"Yeah, you got to follow other people's beliefs. Okay. I guess when in Rome, right? Yeah, you crucify the guy\""]
["27:29,720","27:33,080","\"That's what that refers to right\""]
["27:33,080","27:37,760","\"Yes, murder Jesus that's clever\""]
["27:37,760","27:46,360","\"Oh shit, I heard a scary monster. Did ye thought I did go outside and say hello to it\""]
["27:46,360","27:59,120","\"Jeez, just be with me Jesus. Oh, this fucking sucks. It's where you gotta say Jesus. Please us common help. Oh\""]
["27:59,120","28:03,120","\"Help me say little well\""]
["28:04,480","28:11,100","\"You know, it's good for big piles of dirt big big shovels. Yeah, let's go get that big shovel big big shovel\""]
["28:11,100","28:15,880","\"I'll look another pile of dirt\""]
["28:15,880","28:26,400","\"Oh, oh there was a woman on her period here. It's just a dead pigeon. Oh, okay\""]
["28:26,400","28:28,960","\"I totally read a little that's shape wrong you tweet\""]
["28:30,160","28:33,560","\"It's a fucking like a maxi pad. Yeah\""]
["28:33,560","28:39,420","\"Well, not everything's a delicious. Let's go take up the one in the backyard\""]
["28:39,420","28:46,820","\"Wait, you see the lighthouse right there. It looks like it looks like it looks like it looks like\""]
["28:46,820","28:51,040","\"It looks like don't say it looks like\""]
["28:51,040","28:55,800","\"My\""]

["29:21,280","29:26,360","\"Oh, were those the same seagulls that in convenience do your sandbag holders earlier?\""]
["29:26,360","29:30,440","\"I'd like to believe they are. Yeah, good. They got what was coming to them\""]
["29:30,440","29:34,800","\"This thing's helping you're gonna go right back to your house and put that on your chest\""]
["29:34,800","29:37,760","\"Yeah, I'm gonna put it on my big hairy chest\""]
["29:37,760","29:41,400","\"Oh, tell them all be maggot man. Oh\""]
["29:41,400","29:47,520","\"You still gotta get one more see I'm already so close\""]
["29:49,640","29:51,640","\"Yet so far\""]
["29:51,640","29:53,720","\"All right\""]
["29:53,720","29:57,940","\"There's got to be more shit to dig up because I still haven't found the key to the lighthouse\""]
["29:57,940","30:05,280","\"Do you have to find that every day? I mean usually it's someplace easy, but yeah today. I have no way in and\""]
["30:05,280","30:10,060","\"How am I supposed to protect the ships from this horrible fucking weather?\""]
["30:10,060","30:13,000","\"If I can't get into the dang lighthouse\""]
["30:13,000","30:15,760","\"Here's a point law\""]
["30:15,760","30:17,760","\"It's true\""]
["30:17,760","30:25,320","\"Wait, what the fuck? What was that fucking radio voice? If it was a fucking weird crab\""]
["30:25,320","30:31,880","\"What the fuck radio crab it ain't what it used to be a water used to be\""]
["30:31,880","30:33,880","\"What it used to be oh?\""]
["30:33,880","30:42,700","\"My god, it's coming at you in blasting dubstep whatever building I go to I'm gonna have a shitty angle on the entrance\""]
["30:42,700","30:44,700","\"Oh, he's getting close\""]
["30:45,340","30:48,420","\"Yeah, I needed like dodge left and right more. Oh\""]
["30:48,420","30:53,980","\"I don't know if that help. Yeah, it didn't really look like a good serpentine. It's\""]
["30:53,980","30:59,940","\"It's not a sniper. It's a crab a bug a centipede. Oh\""]
["30:59,940","31:03,820","\"Shit\""]
["31:03,820","31:09,900","\"Where the fuck's the entrance? Yes, it really seemed like he was gonna get you there. Hmm\""]
["31:09,900","31:12,940","\"Okay, I\""]
["31:13,020","31:18,060","\"Think I want to go back to where he just chased me from though. I'm pretty sure he was guarding something. Yeah\""]
["31:18,060","31:25,540","\"I wish this game had like sliding around your ass physics, you know\""]
["31:25,540","31:31,100","\"That would make truly a better game and if it was like 2d instead of 3d\""]
["31:31,100","31:32,980","\"and\""]
["31:32,980","31:36,460","\"if it had like really good graphics rather than really bad graphics and\""]
["31:36,460","31:39,980","\"You're mean this is supposed to\""]
["31:40,980","31:44,900","\"I love the graphics of this. Yeah, it's really nicely made\""]
["31:44,900","31:51,060","\"So wait you said that this was inspired by the lighthouse. Yeah, I how fast did they make this game then?\""]
["31:51,060","31:58,420","\"I mean Lighthouse came out in 2019 and I do think this this was like made pretty quickly. It's not that long of a game\""]
["31:58,420","32:03,380","\"It's still pretty impressive. Yeah, here we go\""]
["32:03,380","32:08,420","\"Like if you can crank something out in a year just just like a finished product\""]
["32:09,620","32:11,620","\"I think that's pretty cool. I'd be proud\""]
["32:11,620","32:18,300","\"If I made this oh, they buried both of your things there or you buried both of your whatever either\""]
["32:18,300","32:25,620","\"You went into a fugue state and buried your shit out here. I can't remember which way I even came from the rain just got worse\""]
["32:25,620","32:29,300","\"There's the lighthouse\""]
["32:29,300","32:30,820","\"There you go\""]
["32:30,820","32:32,820","\"You're on track\""]
["32:32,820","32:35,620","\"Good thing my lantern is\""]
["32:37,300","32:39,520","\"vulnerable to water the ps1\""]
["32:39,520","32:41,420","\"Horristhetics is so good\""]
["32:41,420","32:48,420","\"It's better to make a game that's functional and like vague rather than something that's photo realistic and like barely functions\""]
["32:48,420","32:53,620","\"And doesn't you know and most photo realistic stuff comes off and candy no matter what anyway?\""]
["32:53,620","32:56,780","\"Oh, that's it again. Are you fucking kidding me?\""]
["32:56,780","33:03,980","\"What is I think that little whale and didn't that make that exact same noise before I got chased last time did it?\""]
["33:03,980","33:06,940","\"You're inside already. Yeah, I'm good. I think I'm good\""]
["33:06,940","33:13,940","\"Oh yeah, I guess I gotta fill up my can.\""]
["33:13,940","33:14,940","\"Whoa!\""]
["33:14,940","33:15,940","\"What the fuck?\""]
["33:15,940","33:19,940","\"I guess that was just lightning, but it was scary sounding.\""]
["33:19,940","33:20,940","\"Sound like a growl.\""]
["33:20,940","33:23,940","\"And that's what sounded like to me too.\""]
["33:23,940","33:24,940","\"Oh.\""]
["33:24,940","33:28,940","\"And then the storm goes totally silent, seriously?\""]
["33:28,940","33:29,940","\"Oh.\""]
["33:29,940","33:30,940","\"Oh, okay.\""]
["33:30,940","33:31,940","\"That room?\""]
["33:31,940","33:32,940","\"Such good acoustics.\""]

["33:33,940","33:34,940","\"Yeah.\""]
["33:34,940","33:35,940","\"That room?\""]
["33:35,940","33:36,940","\"That room?\""]
["33:36,940","33:37,940","\"That's such good acoustics.\""]
["33:37,940","33:39,940","\"That floor wasn't black before, was it?\""]
["33:39,940","33:40,940","\"Oh.\""]
["33:40,940","33:41,940","\"Oh.\""]
["33:41,940","33:43,580","\"There's that a goo thing.\""]
["33:43,580","33:45,180","\"It might be more goo.\""]
["33:45,180","33:48,180","\"What the fuck fell off the lighthouse the first time you looked at that window?\""]
["33:48,180","33:49,180","\"What was that?\""]
["33:49,180","33:50,180","\"I don't know.\""]
["33:50,180","33:53,980","\"For all I know it was just like a pigeon, or a seagull I mean.\""]
["33:53,980","33:56,980","\"Yeah, it looked like guy shaped vaguely.\""]
["33:56,980","34:00,140","\"Like it was, it was like, it could have been a bird.\""]
["34:00,140","34:02,700","\"It could have been like the body of the last dude.\""]
["34:02,700","34:03,700","\"Hmm.\""]
["34:03,700","34:09,540","\"It clearly was not like a crab or something whenever the fuck's chasing you.\""]
["34:09,540","34:12,020","\"It wasn't that.\""]
["34:12,020","34:19,820","\"But whatever's fucking with you is clearly intelligent at least to some degree because\""]
["34:19,820","34:24,140","\"it's cutting your ropes and shit.\""]
["34:24,140","34:25,220","\"Which is kind of funny.\""]
["34:25,220","34:26,220","\"You gotta admit.\""]
["34:26,220","34:27,220","\"That's lols.\""]
["34:27,220","34:32,000","\"Dude, a crab with thoughts.\""]
["34:32,000","34:34,120","\"I would hate that.\""]
["34:34,120","34:36,620","\"I don't like crabs.\""]
["34:36,620","34:42,540","\"Do you have any bug that can walk upright and...?\""]
["34:42,540","34:44,340","\"Ooh, I think.\""]
["34:44,340","34:45,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["34:45,960","34:47,320","\"You can't see shit up here.\""]

["34:49,720","34:50,920","\"I love you.\""]
["34:50,920","34:52,860","\"It was ideal as a door can.\""]
["34:52,860","34:58,860","\"Oh, made me do this.\""]
["34:58,860","35:03,860","\"I guess just go back to bed and just think about your beloved wife and all that stuff.\""]
["35:03,860","35:05,360","\"Wait, oh stop moving.\""]
["35:05,360","35:06,360","\"Wait really?\""]
["35:06,360","35:10,060","\"I gotta crank it all over again.\""]
["35:10,060","35:12,060","\"What happened?\""]
["35:12,060","35:15,860","\"If this thing did it again.\""]
["35:15,860","35:22,860","\"Should I put on some beautiful music from our little gramophone?\""]
["35:22,860","35:23,860","\"I think so.\""]
["35:23,860","35:24,860","\"You could.\""]
["35:24,860","35:28,860","\"Alright, I'm gonna do it.\""]
["35:28,860","35:31,860","\"There you go.\""]
["35:31,860","35:37,860","\"I think that undoes the cranking when you come up here.\""]
["35:37,860","35:38,860","\"I don't know.\""]
["35:38,860","35:39,860","\"I mean, it's still spinning.\""]
["35:39,860","35:42,860","\"Oh, I think you're done here then.\""]
["35:42,860","35:45,860","\"I think it wants you to go back down.\""]
["35:45,860","35:48,860","\"Okay.\""]
["35:48,860","35:55,860","\"Can I watch the lighthouse now tonight?\""]
["35:55,860","35:58,860","\"Oh, it just went dark.\""]
["35:58,860","36:00,860","\"It did just go, fuck.\""]
["36:00,860","36:03,860","\"Well, now I need to get more oil.\""]
["36:03,860","36:06,860","\"Are you sure it's not like glitching right now?\""]
["36:06,860","36:14,860","\"That always sounds like a scary monster.\""]
["36:14,860","36:15,860","\"Yeah sure does.\""]
["36:15,860","36:17,860","\"Oh, okay.\""]

["37:32,220","37:34,220","\"It was never a problem before.\""]
["37:34,220","37:40,420","\"Was that what the ink is? Is it just taking your oil and fucking smearing it around the walls like an asshole?\""]
["37:40,420","37:44,220","\"Maybe. I don't know if it's the- maybe it is crude oil like that.\""]
["37:44,220","37:48,020","\"That would have sucked to have to clean off then.\""]
["37:48,020","37:51,620","\"Like if it's some kind of squid crab that eats gasoline...\""]

["39:29,800","39:37,260","\"Returns out the last episode and they did say it's like an autistic kid playing with a snow globe. Yeah, but sane elsewhere\""]
["39:37,260","39:43,120","\"Funny shit. I ever heard they had this entire show like and it was like a hospital drama\""]
["39:43,120","39:49,360","\"It's a hospital drama and in the final episode it turns out it was all in the brain of an autistic child playing with a snow globe\""]

["40:49,340","40:56,340","\"But was that implied that, oh no, I guess it broke the roof and dropped a bird through?\""]
["40:56,340","40:57,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["40:57,340","41:01,900","\"When you saw the thing moving, it went through the roof and it went out to the hallway toward\""]
["41:01,900","41:04,060","\"the other side of the house before the crash.\""]
["41:04,060","41:07,900","\"I think it just was climbing across to there.\""]
["41:07,900","41:11,700","\"Okay, so it probably just stuck its foot through the roof or something.\""]
["41:11,700","41:14,780","\"Why is there just one dead bird here though?\""]
["41:14,780","41:17,140","\"It's saying you're going to be the bird someday.\""]

["41:49,220","42:06,220","\"What's that? Some planks of wood, some nails, a hammer, and a ladder. Well you can just put the ladder in your inventory.\""]
["42:06,220","42:13,340","\"inventory. Yeah. At least we know this guy has really deep pockets if he gets\""]
["42:13,340","42:17,260","\"into trouble. So when that thing runs after you, make him run under the ladder\""]
["42:17,260","42:20,940","\"and then he'll like fall off the cliff for bad luck. You get that bad luck. Fuck\""]
["42:20,940","42:26,260","\"that sounds like him. Hope we don't come.\""]

["42:34,980","42:36,980","\"Is it gonna be like that?\""]
["42:36,980","42:43,040","\"No, that's pretty intuitive. Yeah, and now we go put nails in\""]
