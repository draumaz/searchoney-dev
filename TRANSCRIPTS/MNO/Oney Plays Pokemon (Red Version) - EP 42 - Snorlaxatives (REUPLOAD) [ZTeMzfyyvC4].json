["00:32,480","00:33,680","\"Nubu Matsu.\""]
["00:33,680","00:37,760","\"He ran into a hospital with a microphone and recorded children dying.\""]

["01:50,280","01:57,140","\"A bike is like what it's a is it a million? It was at a hundred thousand. I forget how much it is talking about the real world\""]

["02:00,200","02:03,840","\"I'm saying in the real world it would be different because in Pokemon you got bullshit science\""]
["02:03,840","02:07,820","\"But in the real world it would be a lot more difficult when you're changing the rules of Pokemon Chris\""]
["02:07,820","02:11,160","\"Okay, fine in the real world then you could afford pokeball. Okay fine\""]
["02:11,160","02:19,680","\"Carrying more than one pokeball around would be hindrance. Okay. Well, they shrink now. You're just being whiny. That's not being whiny\""]
["02:19,680","02:23,680","\"I can barely fit my fucking phone in my pocket. I can alone a\""]
["02:23,680","02:28,520","\"Max goofs evolving. I'm pretty sure we shouldn't let him do that yet\""]

["02:31,760","02:36,720","\"I don't know how to be cool. I remember what they learn when they better rot. I could catch better thing\""]
["02:36,720","02:39,960","\"We're that bit there man. I could love some more\""]
["02:39,960","02:49,520","\"Are you gonna catch a snorlour I could get rid of a lot of these items. I'm sorry wake up snorlour\""]
["02:49,520","02:50,520","\"Relax.\""]
["02:50,520","02:53,060","\"Wasn't that a book?\""]
["02:53,060","02:55,500","\"Wake up, Snorlax.\""]
["02:55,500","02:57,420","\"Did your parents make fun of Pokémon 2?\""]
["02:57,420","03:00,460","\"Yeah, she'd make fun of Snorlax all the time, my mother.\""]
["03:00,460","03:01,460","\"Say, what a fat ass.\""]
["03:01,460","03:02,820","\"Oh, I like that he's pink.\""]

["03:10,660","03:15,980","\"I can't use either of these.\""]
["03:15,980","03:18,500","\"Snorlax would be a pretty cool real Pokémon to have.\""]
["03:18,500","03:23,500","\"Do you have to feed all your Pokemon?\""]
["03:23,500","03:28,500","\"If you put them in your Pokeball, do they have to be fed until you take them out?\""]
["03:28,500","03:33,500","\"I mean, that's why they started introducing so many different types of Pokemon food, right?\""]
["03:33,500","03:36,500","\"Oh. That sucks.\""]
["03:36,500","03:39,500","\"When they're in their Pokeball, time just freezes for the moment.\""]
["03:39,500","03:41,500","\"That's what I figured.\""]
["03:41,500","03:44,500","\"That's the only way it would be humane.\""]
["03:44,500","03:46,500","\"It would be like getting your Pokeball.\""]
["03:46,500","03:53,260","\"Pokeball that's a humane there's nothing you mean the bad it's no Christ Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah\""]
["03:53,260","03:58,320","\"It is humane if time freezes for them in their pokeball and they don't notice that they're in there\""]
["03:58,320","04:00,900","\"But you're still catching them to begin with that. How's that humane?\""]
["04:00,900","04:08,340","\"Oh, they're past they're taken they're taking over civilization. You have psychic fucking guys floating in your window at night\""]
["04:12,460","04:14,780","\"Look in picture of drowsy. Yeah\""]
["04:14,780","04:20,380","\"Can you imagine a fucking alica zam just like trying to get into your house at nighttime that would be the worst\""]
["04:20,380","04:22,380","\"I'd be so scary. Yeah\""]
["04:22,380","04:25,900","\"There'd be onyx is like smashing up your house just for fun\""]
["04:25,900","04:31,820","\"Guard doses would take out ships full of cocaine and spread it throughout the ocean\""]
["04:31,820","04:39,020","\"I thought I'd really be freaking out. Maltres with Burn downtown Zapdos would kill everyone in church\""]
["04:40,980","04:46,040","\"Imagine hit my channel hit Monalee just beating the shit out of people and taking their stuff probably would\""]
["04:46,040","04:53,660","\"Yeah, they go into a 7-11 look I can't think of a single Pokemon that would be civil if you didn't catch it\""]
["04:53,660","04:59,860","\"You confuse me\""]
["04:59,860","05:09,100","\"Oh you better try to catch them in a second here I'm trying I'm trying\""]
