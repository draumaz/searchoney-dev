["00:24,340","00:26,260","\"Who knows?\""]
["00:27,820","00:31,740","\"I hear this game is better than Daisy so let's give it a shot.\""]
["00:31,740","00:34,940","\"I've already played the server for a few seconds to see what it's like.\""]
["00:34,940","00:36,860","\"Seemed pretty cool, I mean.\""]

["00:44,860","00:46,780","\"Let's see if this is better than Daisy.\""]
["00:46,780","00:49,980","\"Let's see if it tops the immersion.\""]
["00:49,980","00:50,940","\"I don't know though.\""]
["00:50,940","00:54,140","\"Might be scary.\""]
["00:54,140","00:56,800","\"(ominous music)\""]
["00:56,800","00:59,700","\"Might be shit.\""]

["01:30,980","01:33,180","\"is you're right clicking this shit, you go to shred.\""]
["01:33,180","01:35,660","\"And it takes a few seconds.\""]
["01:35,660","01:39,100","\"And then you fucking leg it.\""]
["01:39,100","01:40,340","\"No!\""]
["01:40,340","01:41,180","\"Get up.\""]
["01:41,180","01:46,100","\"Okay, you guys just first say this game looks quite nice\""]
["01:46,100","01:49,900","\"and it runs quite good for one of these games.\""]
["01:49,900","01:52,900","\"like rust and daisy. Okay, I spoke too soon.\""]
["01:52,900","01:55,900","\"But no, for the most part, it does run pretty good.\""]
["01:55,900","01:59,900","\"Mm, Robert.\""]
["01:59,900","02:03,900","\"The frame rate's consistent.\""]

["02:10,900","02:16,900","\"Okay, so I hear you're supposed to find a hatchet and cut down trees.\""]
["02:16,900","02:18,900","\"Then you can make a bow and arrow.\""]
["02:18,900","02:25,900","\"I'm just kind of scared though.\""]
["02:25,900","02:29,420","\"I'm just going to stick to these trees.\""]
["02:29,420","02:32,180","\"I'm going to stick in like a sore shadow.\""]

["03:41,340","03:47,940","\"That guy was not in the mood for me.\""]
["03:47,940","03:58,560","\"This looks like that scene out of the road.\""]
["03:58,560","04:01,160","\"Maybe it's based on it.\""]
["04:01,160","04:04,480","\"Restricted.\""]
["04:04,480","04:07,120","\"Use of deadly force authorized.\""]

["05:00,480","05:02,080","\"I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.\""]
["05:02,080","05:05,080","\"So if you don't like that, now is your chance to leave.\""]
