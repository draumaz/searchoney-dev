["14:45,980","14:50,820","\"- It's strange, but it's more useful.\""]
["14:50,820","14:53,940","\"For example, that, having the option to do that,\""]
["14:53,940","14:56,380","\"that you can actually onion skin.\""]
["14:56,380","14:57,660","\"- Did they not have that originally?\""]

["15:09,780","15:13,500","\"- No, you gotta experiment sometimes.\""]
["15:13,500","15:15,420","\"- You can transfer stuff off the Game Boy camera too,\""]
["15:15,420","15:16,380","\"that's really cool.\""]
["15:16,380","15:18,740","\"- Wow.\""]
["15:18,740","15:23,420","\"- They released four of these,\""]

["15:53,140","15:56,140","\"Let's see if it looks okay so far.\""]
["15:56,140","15:58,140","\"What's this problem?\""]
["15:58,140","16:03,140","\"Where's the loopy blends?\""]

["16:16,140","16:18,140","\"You can make stop motion videos with it, I bet.\""]
["16:18,140","16:20,140","\"Oh, that'd be cool.\""]
["16:20,140","16:24,120","\"Because you can hook a camera up to it, which we don't have so\""]

["17:20,060","17:24,280","\"This is like one of one of the only animations ever done in this\""]
