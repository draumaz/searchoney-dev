["14:17,720","14:21,000","\"But the fact she has an asshole is also troubling to me.\""]
["14:21,000","14:25,560","\"I kind of wish that like when God was designing man and she\""]
["14:25,560","14:27,720","\"that maybe he shouldn't have put a little ass.\""]
["14:27,720","14:29,440","\"Why can't we prolapse freely?\""]
["14:29,440","14:30,760","\"That's my question.\""]
["14:30,760","14:34,480","\"How come there is just prolapsing monkeys?\""]
["14:34,480","14:36,080","\"Like why? Why?\""]
["14:36,080","14:40,720","\"They evolved in a way that they had a lot of fun.\""]
["14:40,720","14:42,360","\"Why do they do that?\""]
["14:42,360","14:44,480","\"Imagine if humans had prolapses like that.\""]
["14:44,480","14:45,360","\"They do.\""]
["14:45,360","14:46,960","\"No, but like normally.\""]
["14:47,400","14:49,400","\"Like naturally, I'm pretty sure I do.\""]
["14:49,400","14:52,100","\"I play little jewels on my prolapse.\""]

["14:57,080","14:58,740","\"I hate it.\""]
["14:58,740","15:00,580","\"You know, it's a hot thing in porn now.\""]
["15:00,580","15:01,240","\"They better not.\""]
["15:01,240","15:02,680","\"People are really in the prolapse as well.\""]

["15:03,180","15:04,080","\"I'm being serious.\""]
["15:04,080","15:05,080","\"It's a stop.\""]
["15:05,080","15:08,320","\"They grab the prolapse and throw her above the air.\""]
["15:08,320","15:09,680","\"The prolaxium, they call it.\""]
["15:09,680","15:11,880","\"Prolaxium verge.\""]
["15:11,880","15:16,120","\"Compete worldwide at ranking mode.\""]
["15:16,520","15:18,440","\"Why are the prolax?\""]
["15:18,440","15:21,080","\"Oh fuck, get this bitch off my squade.\""]
["15:21,080","15:26,120","\"Did you know pom pom bash can't home in on far enemies?\""]

["15:31,000","15:33,120","\"Did you ever beat your dad's high score?\""]
["15:33,120","15:36,360","\"He started crying for me.\""]
["15:36,360","15:38,380","\"Super Moscow.\""]
["15:38,380","15:42,080","\"I wish there were cutscenes when you beat a score\""]
["15:42,080","15:43,080","\"in this game.\""]
["15:43,080","15:44,600","\"Everyone's like a teardrop.\""]
["15:44,600","15:46,720","\"Yeah, he'd be really proud of you.\""]

["15:57,760","15:59,440","\"Oh, good costumes.\""]
["15:59,440","16:00,520","\"They're having new ones.\""]
["16:00,520","16:01,700","\"Go to--\""]
["16:01,700","16:03,280","\"Yes, the best move!\""]
["16:03,280","16:06,640","\"OK, everybody, now the game is going to pick up speed.\""]
["16:06,640","16:08,920","\"Even I know about this one.\""]
["16:08,920","16:10,680","\"I've read about that one.\""]
["16:10,680","16:14,400","\"It was on the cover of GamePro.\""]
["16:14,400","16:15,880","\"Just in case I've been sniffing a little,\""]
["16:15,880","16:17,400","\"I'm very sorry about my sniffing.\""]
["16:17,400","16:18,240","\"- It's okay.\""]
["16:18,240","16:19,800","\"- I've got a very, very severe sinus.\""]
["16:19,800","16:21,080","\"- And if I sound like a moron,\""]
["16:21,080","16:24,080","\"not only is that how I'm always acting,\""]
["16:24,080","16:26,560","\"I'm also just woke up a few hours ago.\""]
["16:26,560","16:28,640","\"- It sounds like I'm not wearing a shirt just 'cause I am.\""]
["16:28,640","16:29,800","\"- Last night me and Dingdong were up.\""]
["16:29,800","16:31,160","\"- You do sound like that.\""]
["16:31,160","16:32,400","\"- Dingdong were free.\""]
["16:32,400","16:34,480","\"- Messaging each other at 10,\""]
["16:34,480","16:35,320","\"and we were like,\""]
["16:35,320","16:37,000","\"- Let's go up early tomorrow, record all night.\""]
["16:37,000","16:38,240","\"- Yeah, and then we both,\""]
["16:38,240","16:40,360","\"we both messaged each other like the same time\""]
["16:40,360","16:41,520","\"saying neither of us left.\""]
["16:41,520","16:42,920","\"(laughing)\""]
["16:42,920","16:44,280","\"- I really did try, I just couldn't.\""]
["16:44,280","16:47,740","\"I did too. I was right back at what happened was Julian came in the room and I would I\""]
["16:47,740","16:54,920","\"Walk up I couldn't go back to sleep because the door sounds like it's being punched anytime someone opens it\""]
["16:54,920","16:58,880","\"So I freaked the fuck out and just walk out like that dog freaks me out at nighttime\""]
["16:58,880","17:03,320","\"She'll start walking around and like start like that's the one thing that would scare me about having pets again\""]
["17:03,320","17:07,320","\"Is that I would feel like hearing anything in the hallway would just freak me out?\""]
["17:07,320","17:10,960","\"I keep her in my room, but she she starts making this noise with her mouth. She goes\""]
["17:11,920","17:17,020","\"Was stopped because I was telling about this last night, but we got a new cat in our apartment every morning\""]
["17:17,020","17:21,260","\"She's like an alarm clock she nails at the top of her lungs. Yeah like crazy like nonstop\""]
["17:21,260","17:26,540","\"I think she's just horny. Yeah, probably my cat Yuki is the same. He'll walk around at 4 a.m. Go\""]
["17:26,540","17:32,980","\"My cat you keep saying where he's not supposed to\""]
["17:40,340","17:43,480","\"That's a good line. That's a good line. But that on t-shirts\""]
["17:43,480","17:47,860","\"Remember when everyone said I'm awesome. That was a fun time period\""]
["17:47,860","17:54,980","\"That wasn't a annoying character trait at all. I think Scott Pilgrim really made that popular the idea of that in the comic\""]
["17:54,980","17:56,980","\"They did a lot to\""]
["17:56,980","18:04,380","\"The Scott Pilgrim movie is very stylishly edited and we'll give it that Scott good music in it soon yeah\""]
["18:04,380","18:09,020","\"Scott Pilgrim game has such a fucking good soundtrack. I don't know if you've ever heard that\""]
["18:09,020","18:13,580","\"Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Guchi's fucking nice. Yeah, I bought that soundtrack on day one. It's so good.\""]
["18:13,580","18:28,700","\"Shame the Scott poker. I'm not the best source pitcher. No, but that game at least is the best thing. I think you're gonna be. It was. They got rushed on it, which is why it's very buggy, but it's still a lot of fun to play. It's too bad. I got taken down altogether. Yeah.\""]
["18:29,340","18:31,340","\"I mean, you're still gonna PSN and stuff.\""]
["18:31,340","18:34,340","\"Do you remember what happened with the last bit of DLC they did?\""]
["18:34,340","18:37,340","\"Because they kept outsourcing it to different teams.\""]
["18:37,340","18:41,340","\"They stole a sprite from Sonic Battle to use it.\""]
["18:41,340","18:44,340","\"Yeah, to use in the game and people called it out.\""]
["18:44,340","18:48,340","\"So they had to delay the patch because they stole art assets to use in the game.\""]
["18:48,340","18:50,340","\"Oh my god, that's amazing.\""]
["18:50,340","18:54,340","\"It was funny how fast people caught it too. It was like almost immediate.\""]
["18:54,340","18:57,340","\"Well, we're talking about Sonic fans. These things are crazy.\""]
["18:57,340","18:58,180","\"I guess so.\""]
["18:58,180","18:59,340","\"- Now not say anything bad about them,\""]
["18:59,340","19:01,940","\"it's just they're very aware of people.\""]
["19:01,940","19:05,580","\"- But what a thing to do to just steal art assets,\""]
["19:05,580","19:07,980","\"like then be surprised that people would notice.\""]
["19:07,980","19:10,340","\"But that was the last patch they did,\""]
["19:10,340","19:11,780","\"that added online play,\""]
["19:11,780","19:13,980","\"and then they took the game down a year later.\""]
["19:13,980","19:15,980","\"- Yep, I actually do like this music a lot.\""]
["19:15,980","19:17,980","\"- Yeah, no, this soundtrack is really really good.\""]
["19:17,980","19:19,700","\"- It's pirate metal, this one now, right?\""]
["19:19,700","19:22,860","\"- I realize that I don't like a lot of metal on its own\""]
["19:22,860","19:26,540","\"'cause when it's like a rhythm guitar and two lead guitars,\""]
["19:26,540","19:29,540","\"Just kind of sounds boring to me but when they throw in a few extra instruments\""]
["19:29,540","19:34,700","\"It kind of punch punches a little bit more kind of punches me a little bit metal makes me fall asleep\""]
["19:34,700","19:40,300","\"Like some people some bands make it sound unique to them, which is cool\""]
["19:40,300","19:44,380","\"Like there's scream more he screams really loud\""]
["19:44,380","19:48,220","\"I\""]
["19:48,220","19:51,780","\"Like orchestral metal a lot do like\""]
["19:53,220","20:01,940","\"Phonic metal I can but a lot of the time. It's really cringy. Yes. It is like I like the metallic album with all the\""]
["20:01,940","20:06,780","\"Orchestra stuff. I think it can work really well, but a lot of people. That's a funny one. Uh-huh. I\""]
["20:06,780","20:12,840","\"I think it can work, but usually everyone's pretty horrible about it\""]
["20:12,840","20:17,200","\"You ever see that a majority guy from Lord of the Rings the bad\""]
["20:17,620","20:22,260","\"Gandalf bad Gandalf was his name. Mm-hmm. So I remember it was bad off\""]
["20:22,260","20:26,220","\"Yeah, he had a he was in a fucking metal band. Oh really as an old man\""]
["20:26,220","20:30,500","\"He's like yeah, so he's speaking over it was kind of like that. I think well you just talks over all the songs\""]
["20:30,500","20:33,300","\"Like this is me the man in the movie\""]
["20:33,300","20:38,820","\"Oh damn, she squats\""]
["20:38,820","20:43,060","\"That's how I feel all the time\""]
