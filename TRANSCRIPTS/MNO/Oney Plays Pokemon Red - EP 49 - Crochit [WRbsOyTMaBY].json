["00:01,600","00:03,400","\"On a plane!\""]
["00:03,400","00:04,400","\"*Sigh*\""]
["00:04,400","00:05,600","\"With friends.\""]
["00:05,600","00:06,800","\"AHHHHH!\""]
["00:06,800","00:07,800","\"Just don't hear!\""]
["00:07,800","00:10,200","\"*I'm not into it brok-kay*\""]
["00:10,200","00:10,700","\"*Laugh*\""]
["00:10,700","00:11,800","\"Why are we doing it?\""]
["00:11,800","00:12,800","\"*Laugh*\""]
["00:12,800","00:14,400","\"What a weird thing to say.\""]
["00:14,400","00:16,100","\"Yeah, I don't want to fight but go-\""]
["00:16,100","00:17,100","\"*Gasp*\""]
["00:17,100","00:19,300","\"He just had a really weird night with his girlfriend.\""]
["00:19,300","00:21,700","\"That means he also ran up to me to tell me that.\""]
["00:21,700","00:22,400","\"Thank you.\""]
["00:22,400","00:24,200","\"Oh, that's true. Yeah, he approached you.\""]
["00:24,200","00:27,400","\"It's like the girl who goes up to you and then says, \"\"Did you just touch me?\"\"\""]
["00:27,400","00:29,000","\"Why did you run up to me then?\""]
["00:29,500","00:36,500","\"In Pokemon Gold and Silver, I remember when I was talking to my friend when I was like 11 or 12.\""]
["00:36,500","00:38,500","\"He said, \"\"What's a lass?\"\"\""]
["00:38,500","00:39,500","\"It was probably earlier than that.\""]
["00:39,500","00:41,500","\"No, no, he keeps like...\""]
["00:41,500","00:46,500","\"In Pokemon Gold and Silver, you can get phone calls and you can have fights with people who call you up.\""]
["00:46,500","00:47,500","\"Was that true?\""]
["00:47,500","00:48,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:48,500","00:49,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:49,500","00:50,500","\"That's the thing in it.\""]
["00:50,500","00:51,500","\"It was good.\""]
["00:51,500","00:52,500","\"It's actually a thing that I really like about it.\""]
["00:52,500","00:54,500","\"They do it because you can get money back from people by...\""]
["00:54,500","00:55,500","\"Well, plus you can keep grinding.\""]
["00:55,500","00:57,500","\"In this game, you can run out of people to fight.\""]
["00:57,500","01:01,500","\"And you can run out of situations to keep getting things.\""]
["01:01,500","01:02,500","\"That's pretty cool.\""]
["01:02,500","01:03,500","\"It was a good idea.\""]
["01:03,500","01:04,500","\"I like it a lot.\""]
["01:04,500","01:07,500","\"They also call you sometimes that there's groups of Pokemon appearing in the wild.\""]
["01:07,500","01:11,500","\"They have special ones that will sometimes appear in big swarms.\""]
["01:11,500","01:12,500","\"Wow.\""]
["01:12,500","01:14,500","\"It was a really cool idea, especially for a Game Boy Color game.\""]
["01:14,500","01:15,500","\"It made it feel really alive.\""]
["01:15,500","01:18,500","\"Would you say gold and silver are the definitive Pokemon game?\""]
["01:18,500","01:20,500","\"I would say so, yeah.\""]
["01:20,500","01:22,500","\"It added a whole lot.\""]
["01:22,500","01:26,500","\"I remember I had a heart gold and I did not like it.\""]
["01:26,500","01:29,500","\"It's because it slows it down a lot more and adds a lot of dialogue.\""]
["01:29,500","01:35,500","\"It's also incorporating all the design changes and system stuff that they added to the series.\""]
["01:35,500","01:41,500","\"I like the simplicity of this one, but it's not that fleshed out.\""]
["01:41,500","01:44,500","\"I feel like gold and silver probably fleshed it out a ton.\""]
["01:44,500","01:45,500","\"It did.\""]
["01:45,500","01:53,500","\"Personally, for me, the highlight of the series was probably Ruby and Sapphire.\""]
["01:53,500","01:56,700","\"Remember when I had one of those? That's the one where you start with a running shoes, right?\""]
["01:56,700","02:01,500","\"Yes, yeah, I didn't get very far. That's when I started not liking the aesthetic and I just didn't try\""]
["02:01,500","02:10,120","\"Even though I like the Pokemon in that generation, it's definitely like a design change like it's not yeah\""]
["02:10,120","02:12,140","\"It doesn't feel like the same that's one the\""]
["02:12,140","02:19,700","\"That was slow getting the change and everything - but oh my god. I am so stupid about this sure I'll play in you\""]
["02:19,700","02:21,340","\"in me\""]
["02:21,340","02:23,340","\"sticks head inside of you\""]
["02:23,340","02:29,260","\"looks around wow this place stinks that's a good rom hack riz\""]
["02:29,260","02:34,860","\"if they had a little cutscene that had a last rest that says sticks head inside of you\""]
["02:34,860","02:36,860","\"yes\""]
["02:36,860","02:43,660","\"uh she has a rat he's a radical rat i would love to find i wonder it has is there any\""]
["02:43,660","02:48,380","\"psycho out there who made a rom hack and just made it all like that there's stuff like that i\""]
["02:48,380","02:55,580","\"I remember there's a lot of ROM sites where they will include ROM hacks with the original\""]
["02:55,580","02:57,700","\"ROM files sometimes too.\""]
["02:57,700","03:02,740","\"And there's a version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy that was a beat me when I say it because\""]
["03:02,740","03:08,140","\"you're probably not going to get ads if I said the name but it was Mortal Kombat edition.\""]
["03:08,140","03:14,860","\"And the opening of the game says like the evil bootmaster makes poop on all the stupid\""]
["03:14,860","03:15,860","\"people.\""]
["03:15,860","03:17,540","\"And they just swapped all the words.\""]
["03:17,540","03:23,140","\"One of the characters names is just horror boom it's stuff like that like it's the laziest ROM hack I've ever seen\""]
["03:23,140","03:28,540","\"But the ROM file for Mortal Kombat trilogy just comes with that included so if you want to be entertained\""]
["03:28,540","03:30,540","\"I guess you just remind me of something\""]
["03:30,540","03:37,180","\"In school we used to have textbooks like for like I don't know math English and Irish\""]
["03:37,180","03:43,300","\"And in the English one specifically there was short stories that were like made up in the dark\""]
["03:43,300","03:49,120","\"No, they were like made up or printed off the internet by the teacher. I'd like he would write stories for the Simpsons and shit\""]
["03:49,120","03:52,780","\"Why it would be like oh, you just be like test questions\""]
["03:52,780","04:00,540","\"No, like not even it was like he wrote out his own little Simpson stories now to like think about it like not not like\""]
["04:00,540","04:04,800","\"I don't know why he has three donuts and when he takes two no it wasn't like that\""]
["04:04,800","04:07,540","\"It was literally a short story that we were supposed to study\""]
["04:07,540","04:10,660","\"It was like Homer and Marge and Maggie are all in the living room\""]
["04:12,380","04:15,420","\"like oh did you remember how many fingers she helped?\""]
["04:15,420","04:17,720","\"No, it was a grammar test.\""]
["04:17,720","04:18,560","\"That's what it was.\""]
["04:18,560","04:20,060","\"We were supposed to find grammar mistakes.\""]
["04:20,060","04:20,900","\"Okay.\""]
["04:20,900","04:25,540","\"But we used to fucking just be idiots and just cross out words and just replace them.\""]
["04:25,540","04:27,860","\"So it'd be like Homer fucked Maggie.\""]
["04:27,860","04:28,860","\"Homer.\""]
["04:28,860","04:30,860","\"Homer threw Maggie into the fire.\""]
["04:30,860","04:33,380","\"Is that how you came up with the sixons?\""]
["04:33,380","04:34,380","\"No, it's not.\""]
["04:34,380","04:36,780","\"It's just literally something that we used to do with everything.\""]
["04:36,780","04:40,860","\"We would cross out words in our English books and replace verbs and words so that they\""]
["04:40,860","04:45,680","\"They were just disgusting porn and one time the teacher found it and he got really fucking mad\""]
["04:45,680","04:48,960","\"And he kicked my friend out of the classroom even though I was the one who did it\""]
["04:48,960","04:57,020","\"And it felt bad, but it wouldn't feel bad enough. You know what? I was an asshole. Okay. It was a teenager. It's okay\""]
["04:57,020","05:00,860","\"Anyways, hey he did shitty things to me - I don't care\""]
["05:00,860","05:08,420","\"I feel like that's okay Chris. We're escaping this region now except I chose teleport by\""]
["05:08,420","05:15,880","\"I don't know if I ever told the story of my friend Sean Kylie when it we were he he was a new student in my school\""]
["05:15,880","05:18,520","\"At time. This was his first year of like in my school\""]
["05:18,520","05:22,140","\"And he came in and like in the middle of high school essentially\""]
["05:22,140","05:24,140","\"So we were like 16 meeting each other\""]
["05:24,140","05:26,620","\"But he came in and we were doing\""]
["05:26,620","05:31,700","\"We were doing transition year, which means it's a year off and you don't really have to do much\""]
["05:31,700","05:33,820","\"Except come into school and just like\""]
["05:34,060","05:36,360","\"Like just chill like it was see your off\""]
["05:36,360","05:38,940","\"We still have to go to school and do bullshit\""]
["05:38,940","05:45,420","\"But we had art class and we were all given big wooden boards to lean on for the for the paper and shit\""]
["05:45,420","05:47,700","\"Uh-huh, and he just drew this massive\""]
["05:47,700","05:50,980","\"Vaney hairy cock on it with a huge\""]
["05:50,980","06:00,340","\"Like it was like super thick outlines. There's no way you'd be able to like cross it out or like rub it out or anything\""]
["06:00,460","06:07,680","\"You just drew this fucking gigantic cock on it and everyone was laughing at it because it was so funny looking\""]
["06:07,680","06:09,940","\"I would be funny, especially in permanent marker\""]
["06:09,940","06:15,780","\"But I don't know what he was expecting because we all left the class and you flipped the board over\""]
["06:15,780","06:21,460","\"So the teacher wouldn't see right until it was too late, but then we were all in there when the teacher saw no\""]
["06:21,460","06:22,220","\"Okay, no\""]
["06:22,220","06:26,300","\"We were all in our like hub classroom where we have to go and sit and eat lunch or whatever\""]
["06:26,300","06:33,340","\"And the big tall scary teacher walked in who taught Irish and he was pretty much the disciplinary teacher because he was like old and scary\""]
["06:33,340","06:35,340","\"Yeah, and he walked in he was like\""]
["06:35,340","06:38,540","\"So we have a bunch of artists here, do we?\""]
["06:38,540","06:46,180","\"We were just like yes, sir. He's like so I'm going to be cut like I would be calling you thought he was complimenting you\""]
["06:46,180","06:47,180","\"No, no, yeah, exactly\""]
["06:47,180","06:51,620","\"He's like I want to be calling you all out individually and we're going to be lining you up outside\""]
["06:51,620","06:57,180","\"And I'm going to ask you one by one who did it and you know what it is and we're just like oh fuck\""]
["06:57,180","07:03,180","\"So like every single person was getting lined up and the first person he picked was Sean\""]
["07:03,180","07:07,980","\"So Sean just went in and like instantly caved. He's like yeah, I did it. I'm sorry\""]
["07:07,980","07:10,720","\"I'm really sorry. He got sent home and he got a\""]
["07:10,720","07:15,940","\"Disciplinary and he literally had to tell his mom and dad in school what he did\""]
["07:15,940","07:20,860","\"They brought his mom and dad in they were just like go on Sean tell him it's like I\""]
["07:21,260","07:25,260","\"I drew this big massive penis on the board.\""]
["07:25,260","07:29,060","\"- Did he draw it well or was it like--\""]
["07:29,060","07:29,960","\"- It was funny.\""]
["07:29,960","07:32,440","\"- Average, like, just kind of like a--\""]
["07:32,440","07:34,360","\"- It was a big, nasty cock.\""]
["07:34,360","07:37,960","\"Like, it was not pleasant, but it was really funny\""]
["07:37,960","07:41,080","\"'cause Shawn's like, art looks funny, it's just silly.\""]
["07:41,080","07:41,960","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:41,960","07:45,040","\"- So it looked like a big deformed cock, but it was great.\""]
["07:45,040","07:46,600","\"- I wish I had fun-- - That's a good story.\""]
["07:46,600","07:49,520","\"- School stories because everything in like our school system,\""]
["07:49,520","07:51,080","\"when I was younger, it was just a mess.\""]
["07:51,080","07:53,920","\"No, my school experience was mostly terrible.\""]
["07:53,920","07:57,960","\"I've never been so miserable in my whole life\""]
["07:57,960","07:59,680","\"and waking up for school, I hated it.\""]
["07:59,680","08:02,360","\"I've been recently thinking back to a lot of it\""]
["08:02,360","08:04,760","\"and how I'm kind of surprised by it.\""]
["08:04,760","08:07,840","\"For example, they had key loggers on the computers.\""]
["08:07,840","08:09,880","\"That was their security system that they used\""]
["08:09,880","08:10,920","\"at our high school.\""]
["08:10,920","08:11,760","\"That's not good.\""]
["08:11,760","08:12,600","\"They were key logging everyone\""]
["08:12,600","08:14,520","\"and it was automatically taking screenshots.\""]
["08:14,520","08:16,960","\"I found out about it 'cause it was in the C drive\""]
["08:16,960","08:18,880","\"and you could access it through the browser.\""]
["08:18,880","08:19,720","\"Wow.\""]
["08:19,720","08:23,040","\"screenshots of everyone's computer for like every five minutes.\""]
["08:23,040","08:27,700","\"It was tracking every keystroke you made and they were just monitoring kids like\""]
["08:27,700","08:29,620","\"actively which obviously that's normal.\""]
["08:29,620","08:31,120","\"And that system got taken advantage of.\""]
["08:31,120","08:34,120","\"Yeah that's what happened is that a bunch of kids found out about it and they\""]
["08:34,120","08:38,160","\"started going in and messing with kids like email accounts and everything.\""]
["08:38,160","08:42,760","\"And the fact that they had a key logger running already like that's probably why\""]
["08:42,760","08:43,760","\"they suspended the kids.\""]
["08:43,760","08:44,760","\"That is illegal yeah.\""]
["08:44,760","08:48,120","\"Because yeah that's not a legal thing to do but they did it anyways.\""]
["08:48,120","08:50,900","\"We had lots of stuff like that always happening at our school.\""]
["08:50,900","08:52,500","\"Like it just didn't function.\""]
["08:52,500","08:56,060","\"Letting kids have access to computers in school is kind of a bad idea.\""]
["08:56,060","08:57,380","\"Well that too.\""]
["08:57,380","08:58,380","\"Kids are smart.\""]
["08:58,380","08:59,380","\"Kids figure out code and shit right away.\""]
["08:59,380","09:01,380","\"Yes, probably smarter than you.\""]
["09:01,380","09:02,380","\"So you can't-\""]
["09:02,380","09:04,380","\"I mean certainly during that time, because technology-\""]
["09:04,380","09:05,380","\"Because technology-\""]
["09:05,380","09:06,740","\"I feel like things might have changed since then.\""]
["09:06,740","09:12,100","\"I think people are more computer literate in general, but like when I think our generation\""]
["09:12,100","09:17,340","\"was growing up, you kind of assumed that adults didn't know how to use computers, yeah?\""]
["09:17,340","09:18,180","\"Did you say that?\""]
["09:18,180","09:19,000","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:19,000","09:19,840","\"- Maybe that was just my experience.\""]
["09:19,840","09:20,940","\"- No, that's exactly what it was like.\""]
["09:20,940","09:22,540","\"There was that window where no one really knew\""]
["09:22,540","09:25,340","\"how to do anything with technology.\""]
["09:25,340","09:27,780","\"But yeah, that was the thing that happened.\""]
["09:27,780","09:29,540","\"And I didn't think about it when I was a kid\""]
["09:29,540","09:32,260","\"because it was just like, oh God, oh, that's awful.\""]
["09:32,260","09:33,460","\"I don't want to get in trouble\""]
["09:33,460","09:34,940","\"'cause I know about this or anything.\""]
["09:34,940","09:36,820","\"But now that I think about it, it's like, okay,\""]
["09:36,820","09:38,460","\"the reason anyone probably got in trouble\""]
["09:38,460","09:40,700","\"is because yeah, they wanted to cover that up.\""]
["09:40,700","09:42,580","\"They didn't want that to get out there that yes,\""]
["09:42,580","09:46,100","\"they were monitoring what kids were like emailing.\""]
["09:46,100","09:49,500","\"They were able to get their direct information off of that if they wanted to and could get\""]
["09:49,500","09:50,780","\"onto their accounts for things.\""]
["09:50,780","09:54,220","\"Like, that's horrible that they had that system running, I couldn't believe it.\""]
["09:54,220","09:56,060","\"Now, is this the normal spooler?\""]
["09:56,060","09:57,060","\"Was this that other school?\""]
["09:57,060","09:58,820","\"No, this was a normal high school.\""]
["09:58,820","10:00,060","\"This was just a public high school.\""]
["10:00,060","10:03,180","\"And it's in like a rich community and everything too.\""]
["10:03,180","10:08,540","\"So it was pretty crazy that they were doing that to the students there.\""]
["10:08,540","10:10,340","\"Shocker, she said.\""]
["10:10,340","10:14,980","\"Our school had a thing called the language lab, which was just a room full of computers\""]
["10:14,980","10:16,980","\"that we've learned French in.\""]
["10:16,980","10:19,220","\"And I was the guy who showed everyone\""]
["10:19,220","10:22,660","\"how to use Microsoft SAM and make him say shit.\""]
["10:22,660","10:24,100","\"But then this one guy sitting next to me\""]

["10:29,140","10:31,620","\"She threw her language lab at me.\""]
["10:31,620","10:34,340","\"Chris, did you have computer lab technicians\""]

["10:39,140","10:40,260","\"What are you going on?\""]
["10:40,260","10:42,340","\"Uh, when I was in class one time,\""]
["10:42,340","10:47,460","\"a kid was showing me something in the browser as I was writing a paper and all of a sudden\""]
["10:47,460","10:51,940","\"I get logged out and I thought like he had a hotkey or something. So I'm typing my paper\""]

["10:57,140","11:01,100","\"they saved the file and closed it and logged me out again. And they ended up like typing\""]

["11:20,780","11:21,500","\"I got in trouble for it.\""]
["11:21,500","11:22,380","\"That's retarded.\""]
["11:22,380","11:26,620","\"Stuff like that was always happening. That's why, like, I don't have fun school stories.\""]
["11:26,620","11:29,260","\"It was just really suspicious behavior like that.\""]
["11:29,260","11:35,660","\"And just kids kind of getting in trouble because they were figuring out how much of a mess the school system was.\""]
["11:36,060","11:41,660","\"I gotta say, getting unfairly in trouble in school is nothing will make you hate the system more.\""]
["11:41,660","11:42,260","\"It's true.\""]
["11:42,260","11:43,260","\"Like, um...\""]
["11:43,260","11:48,460","\"There was points when I had teachers who would discipline me and I knew I fucked up, but I'd be like, you know what?\""]
["11:48,460","11:50,860","\"Yeah, but then you take it on the chin because you did it.\""]
["11:50,860","11:53,660","\"Yeah, I screwed up. I'm sorry. But then there's other times...\""]
["11:53,660","11:57,260","\"Like, that's what happened with the computer... with my computer teacher.\""]
["11:57,260","12:00,260","\"Like, one time I was fucking around, she gave me detention or whatever, and I...\""]

["12:02,660","12:04,660","\"But then later on, I was being a cockhead.\""]
["12:04,660","12:08,860","\"But then, there was times where you would get in trouble for something like you didn't do,\""]
["12:08,860","12:11,760","\"or someone else is sitting next to you, like, talking to you,\""]
["12:11,760","12:13,460","\"and you're like, \"\"You stop?\"\"\""]
["12:13,460","12:16,160","\"And then the teacher will yell at you and give you detention,\""]

["12:17,860","12:22,060","\"Make you be like, \"\"You're fucking with my life, and it's not my fault. Why are you doing that?\"\"\""]
["12:22,060","12:29,260","\"This is definitely not as serious as an example, but I remember in grade school,\""]
["12:29,260","12:31,860","\"they were teaching crocheting for our school.\""]
["12:31,860","12:37,740","\"They didn't have like electives or anything, but you got the class was called handy work or something\""]
["12:37,740","12:41,960","\"Yeah, and so we were learning to crochet and I accidentally said crochet\""]
["12:41,960","12:45,780","\"But like it wasn't on purpose because I was I was a little kid\""]
["12:45,780","12:51,740","\"I didn't swear and the teacher was furious with me and and I still got in trouble for it\""]
["12:51,740","12:53,300","\"I couldn't convince her that I didn't do it\""]
["12:53,300","12:55,300","\"Yeah, I had the same thing happen\""]
["12:55,300","13:01,700","\"I got kept at school the entire day to the point that my mom even showed up and was saying like he's coming home\""]

["13:14,460","13:19,140","\"And I think I was kept until like 430 or something like it was a few hours after school had ended\""]
["13:19,140","13:23,740","\"until finally like I just got pulled out of there but that was that's why I wish I had\""]
["13:23,740","13:29,180","\"fun stories this is the stuff that always happened we had a in in middle school there\""]
["13:29,180","13:35,180","\"was a kid who smeared his shit across all the lockers one day and then pulled a fire alarm\""]
["13:35,180","13:38,500","\"because he was about to get in trouble. The whole school guy called together and like\""]
["13:38,500","13:42,180","\"the auditorium about it. He told me that before. Yeah, and then he pulled the fire alarm so\""]
["13:42,180","13:46,300","\"everyone just left. But stuff like that was always happening. Like everybody there, it\""]
["13:46,300","13:51,780","\"just felt like it was just constant chaos. I had a guy in my school who pissed his pants\""]
["13:51,780","13:56,060","\"just because someone told him to. You're like, \"\"You should piss yourself.\"\" And he's like,\""]
["13:56,060","13:58,060","\"Okay, and he did it.\""]
["13:58,060","13:59,060","\"Wow.\""]
["13:59,060","14:00,060","\"It was a real funny guy.\""]
["14:00,060","14:03,060","\"He was also the same guy he wrote his name on the toilet with shit.\""]
["14:03,060","14:06,060","\"I mean, kids would do dumb stuff like that too.\""]
["14:06,060","14:07,060","\"Yeah.\""]
["14:07,060","14:09,060","\"Just because it's like, \"\"Yo, it's funny.\"\"\""]
["14:09,060","14:12,060","\"This music to that visuals hilarious.\""]
["14:12,060","14:15,060","\"Well, him smearing a shit around was really upbeat music.\""]
["14:15,060","14:16,060","\"And then that...\""]
["14:16,060","14:18,060","\"Is the shit falling back in the toilet?\""]
["14:18,060","14:20,060","\"That's a teacher catching him and he's running away.\""]
["14:20,060","14:25,060","\"That's teacher grabbing him by the neck.\""]
["14:25,060","14:30,580","\"That's them screaming at him punching him on the head and now the teacher wins\""]
["14:30,580","14:36,180","\"The child's been knocked out. No he's back\""]
["14:36,180","14:42,940","\"What was the most trouble someone at your school got in?\""]
["14:42,940","14:47,700","\"My friend, my best friend for the first three years he used to get in trouble\""]
["14:47,700","14:54,220","\"every day. I don't know like you know what I also had three people in my\""]
["14:54,220","14:58,860","\"class all called Steven and they were the worst in the class they were the ones always getting in trouble and\""]
["14:58,860","15:00,900","\"one of them\""]
["15:00,900","15:04,740","\"Do what I think I yeah, he was the science teacher for my first year\""]
["15:04,740","15:10,740","\"He he was so mean to one of those Stevens and like that this Steven was actually like a nice guy\""]
["15:10,740","15:12,140","\"But he just got in trouble a lot\""]
["15:12,140","15:18,620","\"But the teacher was so brutally mean to him that one time he started shaking in his face turn like blood red\""]
["15:18,620","15:22,700","\"Like really dark red and the teacher was like making fun of him while this was happening\""]
["15:22,700","15:28,720","\"And then I think Steven said something along the lines of I hope your house burns to the ground or something like that\""]
["15:28,720","15:34,260","\"And I shit you not that year his house burned to the ground. Oh my god. Yeah, no he didn't do it\""]
["15:34,260","15:39,340","\"It was because the teacher was an alcoholic. Oh, and he just like fell asleep with the oven on or something\""]
["15:39,340","15:47,460","\"There is justice sometimes I remember a bunch of kids in class thought it was really funny to hold your breath until you passed out\""]
["15:47,460","15:52,520","\"the one did it and then when he collapsed he cracked his head on the radiator and had to go to the hospital\""]
["15:52,520","15:55,140","\"Yeah, I don't know why literally cracked his head\""]
["15:55,140","16:00,180","\"It's like it actually his skull got cracked open and he ended up getting pulled out and got sent to the hospital\""]
["16:00,180","16:02,180","\"I don't know why you would do something like that\""]
["16:02,180","16:06,940","\"There's a that's really you deserve that in full if you're gonna be tempting fate like that\""]
["16:06,940","16:10,380","\"You should not be trying to just pass out for no reason just for fun\""]
["16:10,380","16:16,920","\"There's a weird like sad truth that I'd say 10% of teachers really want to help kids\""]
["16:16,920","16:23,160","\"And the other 90% are just failures who are stuck in that job probably we had a we had a teacher in our one grade\""]
["16:23,160","16:26,760","\"And she actually got fired because she was intentionally avoiding working\""]
["16:26,760","16:32,000","\"She would tell everyone to go read books. Yeah, and then she would just leave the room and sometimes she didn't even come in\""]
["16:32,000","16:38,160","\"I think that the same teacher where you were reminded of her because of the new undertale thing\""]
["16:38,160","16:44,480","\"Why the how you said that you had a teacher that was looking at porn in class that was different\""]
["16:44,480","16:49,520","\"But that one was pretty bad too. Oh boy. That one was pretty bad too. I know lots of stuff\""]
["16:49,520","16:53,040","\"They lied to us that 9/11 didn't happen. I remember that was a thing\""]
["16:53,040","16:58,600","\"They told everybody for like two months straight that it wasn't real because I didn't want the kids to be upset\""]
["16:58,600","17:00,600","\"That's kind of funny, but not really\""]
["17:00,600","17:07,120","\"Jesus I have a serious serious appreciation for teachers who actually care\""]
["17:07,120","17:14,240","\"You really appreciate it. Yeah, I do remember them for the rest of your life. I can remember teachers who cared\""]
["17:14,240","17:15,440","\"I still like that.\""]
["17:15,440","17:17,840","\"I have good friends with a lot of the tech department.\""]
["17:17,840","17:22,720","\"Yeah, I had like one or two really good teachers that I really care about and we're super kind,\""]
["17:22,720","17:28,640","\"but the rest were just like washed up pieces of shit who seemingly liked to be just be horrible\""]
["17:28,640","17:30,400","\"to kids. It was just like fuck you.\""]
["17:30,400","17:33,440","\"But are you gonna go with something?\""]
["17:33,440","17:36,640","\"I was gonna say like have you ever seen that video on YouTube of the guy?\""]
["17:36,640","17:42,320","\"He's in like the classroom and he's like I'm so fucking sick of you handing out packets.\""]
["17:42,320","17:49,120","\"You need to like touch these kids. You need to actually get on their level and like speak to them and teach them not just fucking hand out packets.\""]
["17:49,120","17:54,120","\"I remember the first time I saw it, I was like, wow, that really is relatable. That's just like what most teachers are.\""]
["17:54,120","17:58,920","\"They just sit there and like just throw something at you and make you do it and they don't care.\""]
["17:58,920","18:01,320","\"That's what they call busy work. Yeah.\""]
["18:01,320","18:08,920","\"I remember this too. We had a technology course and the idea was that we had to learn how to use Pearl,\""]
["18:08,920","18:11,700","\"which is like a command line thing that you have to do for networking.\""]
["18:11,700","18:15,100","\"Like if you want to get into a FTP, if you want to upload files and everything.\""]
["18:15,100","18:17,560","\"And we were supposed to use that to\""]
["18:17,560","18:18,460","\"Is that like perforce?\""]
["18:18,460","18:22,860","\"It, it, I don't know how to really explain it in a way that would make too much sense,\""]
["18:22,860","18:27,980","\"but it was, it was a thing that we were supposed to learn just for the sake of uploading files to the school system.\""]
["18:27,980","18:30,900","\"And we did not get taught how to actually do it.\""]
["18:30,900","18:34,980","\"We got told that we had to do it, but he said nothing to us about it.\""]
["18:34,980","18:37,100","\"It wasn't in the book or anything either.\""]
["18:37,100","18:40,800","\"He just expected us to do it and what ended up happening was that\""]
["18:40,800","18:46,060","\"I ended up just finding that he had the file uploaded already and I hate saying this\""]
["18:46,060","18:50,260","\"I'm sorry. I'm admitting this, but it's what ended up happening. Oh, you should be playing the game\""]
["18:50,260","18:52,700","\"Yeah, I should be sorry. I'm sorry. I stopped for a second\""]
["18:52,700","18:58,580","\"But uh I ended up just taking his file and showing it to everybody so they could re-upload it\""]
["18:58,580","19:02,100","\"And I showed them how to use Pearl because he wasn't teaching anybody how to do it\""]
["19:02,100","19:06,260","\"I know it was really fucking frustrating having a teacher who wouldn't actually teach the class\""]
["19:06,260","19:11,200","\"I had a business teacher who literally taught no one anything. He just sat up there\""]
["19:11,200","19:16,640","\"It happens like sometimes they will just expect you to go through the book on your own and just sort of sit there and hand you tests\""]
["19:16,640","19:21,100","\"Yeah, it's frustrating. No, he came in on the first day in first-year business\""]
["19:21,100","19:27,560","\"And he put up like profit and loss sheet in front of us. Just like just do that. We're like what how and he's like figured out\""]
["19:27,560","19:29,560","\"We're like just okay. I\""]
["19:29,560","19:35,360","\"Literally never learned how to do because I just drew on paper in his class and he didn't even care\""]
["19:35,360","19:39,140","\"I just literally I wasted all that fucking time drawing on paper me good\""]
["19:39,140","19:42,160","\"maybe\""]

["19:57,320","20:02,200","\"I had a situation kind of like that where we had a in college a mature student\""]

["20:07,420","20:13,740","\"Uh-huh, which is not going to fucking happen. It's just not going to happen. I don't know why that person signed up for it\""]
