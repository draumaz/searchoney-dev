["04:14,560","04:18,560","\"I hate it when you get invested in a character and it turns out to fictional.\""]

["04:28,560","04:34,280","\"She was a nobody. I legitimately thought that Harry Potter was real up until I was 27\""]

["05:23,280","05:24,840","\"I was trying to think of an actual way.\""]
["05:24,840","05:25,680","\"- That's not what he says.\""]
["05:25,680","05:26,520","\"- Does that mean somebody says?\""]
["05:26,520","05:27,360","\"- No.\""]

["05:54,680","05:58,160","\"Also, do you, was I looking down and you beat Gary?\""]
["05:58,160","06:04,200","\"Because I thought he was at the end. He's at the end. No, I mean the end of victory road that music's so fucking good\""]
["06:04,200","06:06,200","\"You find my the end of this\""]
["06:06,200","06:10,380","\"He's the I remember he's the champion, but I thought you had to fight him before you leave the cave\""]
["06:10,380","06:14,440","\"Maybe I'm thinking of golden sober. I did that fight earlier when I was coming up here\""]
["06:14,440","06:19,320","\"Oh, no, I forgot you have to fight don't you have to fight like a whole group of people besides these guys?\""]
["06:19,320","06:21,320","\"Yeah, but let's see if we can do it\""]
["06:21,320","06:26,200","\"Welcome! I am Sheila, captain of glasses and water!\""]

["06:39,700","06:41,580","\"Mealy shealy.\""]
["06:41,580","06:43,380","\"That's what they called her.\""]
["06:43,380","06:45,160","\"Go little stank.\""]
["06:45,160","06:47,220","\"Wow, they're actually higher level than I thought.\""]
["06:47,220","06:47,720","\"Oh.\""]
["06:47,720","06:49,360","\"Maybe this is gonna turn out horrible.\""]
["06:49,360","06:50,460","\"There we go!\""]
["06:50,460","06:52,460","\"You might be able to do it. We'll see. We'll see.\""]
["06:52,460","06:56,060","\"The thing is, I feel like Gary's shit is like level 70.\""]
["06:56,060","06:56,560","\"Is it?\""]
["06:56,560","06:58,560","\"I know he started to sleep.\""]
["06:58,560","07:01,560","\"What the fuck?\""]
["07:01,560","07:02,960","\"How'd he do that?\""]
["07:02,960","07:03,960","\"Because he wants slip.\""]
["07:03,960","07:05,060","\"Yeah, that helps.\""]
["07:05,060","07:06,460","\"He's slipping to his sleep.\""]
["07:06,460","07:07,460","\"Yeah, he heals you.\""]
["07:07,460","07:10,460","\"Doesn't make any sheen.\""]
["07:10,460","07:11,460","\"I mean he's dead.\""]
["07:11,460","07:16,460","\"There's like, he's like strong, so he's getting...\""]
["07:16,460","07:19,360","\"L'Oreal for kids sent out cloister.\""]

["07:23,100","07:49,340","\"Little stank. No! No! Oh, no! You see that? He slapped his little face. He might go down. He's a ground type. I like cloister. He looks cool. I like cloister a lot. He's probably one of my favorites. I just I like the way he is clearly just a human being inside of there. I mean, can't you see it? I see it. I can see it. I can see it. I think you should use the master bow on here.\""]
["07:49,340","07:51,540","\"I think I need to move this upwards in my inventory.\""]
["07:51,540","07:53,540","\"I don't want to use anything called a master bowel.\""]
["07:53,540","07:56,840","\"Was it spelled that way?\""]
["07:56,840","07:59,040","\"Like B-A-E-L?\""]
["07:59,040","08:00,540","\"No, bowel like a bowel.\""]
["08:00,540","08:02,140","\"Like a bowel like a bowel movement.\""]

["08:03,440","08:05,640","\"Yo guys, I've been having a bowel movement.\""]
["08:05,640","08:07,540","\"Please donate to my Patreon.\""]
["08:07,540","08:09,040","\"I've been having a bowel movement.\""]
["08:09,040","08:11,440","\"You'll continue having it for as long as you can get paid.\""]
["08:11,440","08:12,740","\"I keep moving Pokeballs.\""]
["08:12,740","08:16,340","\"We're gonna see how long we can make the log.\""]
["08:16,840","08:21,020","\"To protect the world for big scary cloister Chris what if\""]

["08:24,700","08:27,880","\"That's all I got. Oh, I'm sorry\""]
["08:27,880","08:33,840","\"What are you gonna say to you if you knew that you could continue pooping indefinitely for as long as you could\""]
["08:33,840","08:39,200","\"Would you consider going on a journey to make a poop that encircles the world? No?\""]
["08:39,200","08:43,260","\"Why not it's not worth it. Okay, that's not worth the endeavor\""]
["08:44,760","08:46,920","\"I don't want to be able to say you did.\""]
["08:46,920","08:48,440","\"I don't want to be known as that guy.\""]
["08:48,440","08:53,240","\"Oh, that's the guy who did the big 360 billion mile long shit.\""]
["08:53,240","08:55,880","\"That's horrible.\""]
["08:55,880","08:57,720","\"Well, I mean, add it to your list.\""]
["08:57,720","09:00,840","\"You could achieve a lot of things in your life and also have that, Chris.\""]
["09:00,840","09:02,240","\"Also, it wouldn't count.\""]
["09:02,240","09:07,960","\"Like, once you get so far, the shit you've left behind will start, like, getting kicked around by people.\""]
["09:07,960","09:09,040","\"That's true.\""]
["09:09,040","09:09,600","\"And they'll ruin it.\""]
["09:09,600","09:11,200","\"You'd have to start all over every time.\""]
["09:11,200","09:11,720","\"I know.\""]
["09:12,400","09:17,400","\"It's too bad, I really like the idea of like this really long poop sitting on the bottom of the ocean floor.\""]
["09:17,400","09:18,200","\"I hate that.\""]
["09:18,200","09:19,400","\"Because fish would eat it instantly.\""]
["09:19,400","09:21,400","\"They would. They would be like pecking out it gently.\""]
["09:21,400","09:22,400","\"Little planktons.\""]
["09:22,400","09:26,000","\"You'd be contributing to the environment, Chris.\""]
["09:26,000","09:29,200","\"That's good for the plants. It's good for little bugs like to eat it.\""]
["09:29,200","09:30,000","\"I guess you're right.\""]
["09:30,000","09:33,400","\"I wonder what's the scariest thing in the ocean right now?\""]
["09:33,400","09:36,400","\"Scared? Well, it depends on how you define it.\""]
["09:36,400","09:40,400","\"Like scary looking, like threatening because it could kill you.\""]
["09:40,400","09:44,320","\"No, like I think things that are poisonous are boring.\""]
["09:44,320","09:46,080","\"It's like, yeah, they bite you and you die.\""]
["09:46,080","09:49,440","\"That sucks. But I'm thinking about things that are just terrifying to look at.\""]
["09:49,440","09:56,000","\"How about jinx? At the bottom of the mariona trench embedded in the soil.\""]
["09:56,000","09:56,960","\"Is it jinx?\""]
["09:56,960","10:01,200","\"There's a giant like a, what do they call a barnacle?\""]
["10:01,200","10:07,120","\"It has your face as a child on it and it's slowly crying blood into the ocean.\""]
["10:07,120","10:08,960","\"That's a scary image.\""]
["10:08,960","10:10,300","\"- Julie, what the heck?\""]
["10:10,300","10:11,140","\"- Is that too?\""]
["10:11,140","10:13,580","\"- No, you wanted to know what's the scariest thing\""]
["10:13,580","10:14,500","\"in the ocean.\""]
["10:14,500","10:15,340","\"- That's not real!\""]
["10:15,340","10:16,340","\"- That's not real!\""]
["10:16,340","10:17,860","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:17,860","10:19,660","\"- Well, there you go, I made up with you.\""]
["10:19,660","10:21,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:21,100","10:24,420","\"- No, there is an actual weird eel really deep\""]
["10:24,420","10:25,660","\"in the ocean that has like--\""]
["10:25,660","10:27,020","\"- That does hit your face on it.\""]
["10:27,020","10:28,900","\"- Yeah, that's scary.\""]
["10:28,900","10:30,260","\"Like, can you imagine being a pirate\""]
["10:30,260","10:32,380","\"like hundreds of years ago and seeing that?\""]
["10:32,380","10:35,220","\"- I don't think, I feel, I would have to double check,\""]
["10:35,220","10:37,340","\"but I feel like that particular photo\""]
["10:37,340","10:40,080","\"is just taken from a weird angle and something like that.\""]
["10:40,080","10:40,920","\"- Maybe.\""]
["10:40,920","10:45,060","\"- But yes, the idea that like, you know,\""]
["10:45,060","10:47,700","\"old people obviously seeing weird creatures,\""]
["10:47,700","10:50,260","\"they got the impression that it was,\""]
["10:50,260","10:52,660","\"that there was all kinds of weird monsters in the ocean.\""]
["10:52,660","10:53,820","\"- I keep seeing videos.\""]
["10:53,820","10:55,380","\"Yeah, I keep seeing like recent videos\""]
["10:55,380","10:58,580","\"where it's like, like 60 foot warm found in ocean\""]
["10:58,580","11:01,620","\"and it's like a big ass thick like scary look at the--\""]
["11:01,620","11:02,980","\"- There's lots of animals out there.\""]
["11:02,980","11:04,300","\"- Imagine being back in the old day,\""]
["11:04,300","11:05,380","\"seeing shit like that, you're like,\""]
["11:05,380","11:06,900","\"Oh, that's a monster.\""]
["11:06,900","11:07,740","\"That's an actual monster.\""]
