["00:55,600","00:57,600","\"Oh, we're just gonna start over right away, huh?\""]
["00:57,600","01:00,600","\"It's like a movie. It just rewinds and plays the scene again.\""]
["01:00,600","01:05,840","\"That means that if somebody's getting triggered, they're gonna have to live for it.\""]
["01:05,840","01:07,840","\"Oh! Right in the fire, Winky!\""]

["01:35,220","01:37,260","\"The game doesn't register it sometime.\""]
["01:37,260","01:39,380","\"You didn't learn anything from that book, did you?\""]
["01:39,380","01:42,380","\"I do think there's a frame rate problem.\""]
["01:42,380","01:43,380","\"Really?\""]

["03:10,180","03:16,540","\"I tried to do was grab her twice. How am I supposed to aim in this frame rate? Look at this shit. This game really fucking bites\""]
["03:16,540","03:19,540","\"I'll tell you\""]
["03:19,540","03:25,820","\"By the way, this is the PlayStation 3 one. This isn't the PC one. This is the actual frame rate on a console\""]
["03:25,820","03:29,580","\"I think it's pretty cool. Why is she so heavy all of a sudden?\""]
["03:29,580","03:32,240","\"Cuz I'm going uphill\""]
["03:32,240","03:34,840","\"Whenever she jumps like she just fucking\""]

["03:39,100","03:42,940","\"I don't know it seems like the PC one was based up the first version of this game\""]
["03:42,940","03:47,500","\"They're probably not gonna have any any of those bugs. Yeah, I think this is a crash version\""]
["03:47,500","03:51,020","\"But let me see if it still is the same oil\""]
