["00:27,900","00:28,400","\"No, I guess it-\""]
["00:28,400","00:29,500","\"Oh!\""]
["00:29,500","00:34,840","\"They can fuck up your box. That's really silly that it comes back. You can kick the box with our two I think yeah\""]
["00:34,840","00:39,660","\"Yeah, I think what you're supposed to do is just kind of like fuck. Are they get to hold it down?\""]
["00:39,660","00:44,640","\"It's so I remember like there's a few of these parts specifically that were actually difficult\""]
["00:44,640","00:47,880","\"There's one where you're doing this and it's like on a hill fuck\""]
["00:47,880","00:52,880","\"The first one was a little brutal the the second and third\""]
["00:52,880","00:56,580","\"I kind of remember being a bit more of a breeze, but the first one specifically I\""]
["00:56,580","00:59,160","\"Remember there's a few parts. Oh no\""]
["00:59,160","01:01,340","\"Stupid asshole. That was your fault\""]
["01:01,340","01:07,440","\"So mean it's\""]
["01:07,440","01:10,520","\"Unnecessarily mean being a games is fun, dude\""]
["01:10,520","01:17,000","\"It's just a fucking dick hole and this this was also it came out around the time like it was like mid-2000s edgy\""]
["01:17,000","01:23,640","\"Yeah, no one's hoping he need to put like bullshit like a mortal compass into an action game\""]
["01:23,640","01:25,200","\"It was just you know\""]
["01:25,200","01:28,240","\"It was cool because it gave no fucks.\""]
["01:28,240","01:34,640","\"There's this interesting theory that's probably written by someone who's not educated enough\""]
["01:34,640","01:38,640","\"to have an opinion, I say, on the video game, let's play on YouTube.\""]
["01:38,640","01:46,800","\"They're saying basically the reason you're seeing all these like dad characters is because\""]
["01:46,800","01:54,480","\"the audience that was like 15 or 16 when a game like this came out is now in their mid\""]
["01:54,480","01:56,080","\"into late 20s.\""]
["01:56,080","01:59,400","\"So now it's like, well now these guys are dads.\""]
["01:59,400","02:02,640","\"So now we gotta continue to make Kratos relatable to them\""]
["02:02,640","02:05,400","\"or with the Last of Us or just in general.\""]
["02:05,400","02:09,400","\"You're seeing a lot of like dad video game characters pop up,\""]
["02:09,400","02:10,480","\"which is an interesting theory.\""]
["02:10,480","02:11,880","\"I wouldn't doubt it.\""]
["02:11,880","02:14,960","\"- Swomer, I'm so glad you said you didn't like the Last of Us.\""]
["02:14,960","02:17,440","\"- I mean, I don't hate it.\""]
["02:17,440","02:19,280","\"I just never got into it.\""]
["02:19,280","02:21,480","\"- It's such a boring game.\""]
["02:21,480","02:23,200","\"It's not, it would be a good movie.\""]
["02:23,200","02:26,520","\"I don't think it makes me cooler or edgy to like--\""]
["02:26,520","02:27,680","\"- Grab these guys, Chris.\""]

["02:34,000","02:35,300","\"- These are fun.\""]
["02:35,300","02:38,080","\"- And then I took like a few weeks break\""]
["02:38,080","02:39,280","\"and I tried to play it again.\""]
["02:39,280","02:41,800","\"I'm like, I have no idea what was going on last time I played.\""]
["02:41,800","02:44,240","\"- I'm not supposed to have fun with video games, Tomar.\""]
["02:44,240","02:45,080","\"- Oh, this is the--\""]

["02:49,360","02:50,520","\"Watch as I zip line.\""]
["02:50,520","02:55,660","\"Strange that zip lining has become a thing that's like in a lot of games now. It's cuz it's fun\""]
["02:55,660","03:02,480","\"Is it though? I think it is. I don't find it not fun or like just particularly terrible\""]
["03:02,480","03:06,920","\"It's just a weird thing to show up. There's a lot of it. It does. There's a lot of it in Tomb Raider\""]
["03:06,920","03:13,100","\"I actually really like the new Tomb Raiders by the way. I like the first one the second one was a little too open\""]

["03:23,960","03:29,600","\"I don't I have like like I don't even like like suddenly we all think tastes good though\""]
["03:29,600","03:36,340","\"Pussy up here boy wrong. What really I feel like you can be straight and not like the taste of pussy\""]

["05:45,360","05:46,200","\"- Yeah.\""]
["05:46,200","05:48,320","\"- And here I just thought it was a plain old Leviathan.\""]
["05:48,320","05:49,760","\"No, it's a hydro.\""]
["05:49,760","05:51,880","\"- Yeah, all of these are like the same creature.\""]
["05:51,880","05:52,720","\"- It's a hydro.\""]
["05:52,720","05:53,680","\"- The big one is the main creature.\""]
["05:53,680","05:56,000","\"- It's a hydro-hydra.\""]
["05:56,000","05:58,120","\"- I wonder if it can see through all the eyes\""]
["05:58,120","05:59,640","\"of all these things individually,\""]
["05:59,640","06:01,280","\"and if that's difficult to keep track of.\""]
["06:01,280","06:06,280","\"Yeah, to have three brains, like, like, like, how well do those communicate with each other?\""]
["06:06,280","06:08,080","\"Or do they at all?\""]
["06:08,080","06:11,280","\"One must wonder, one must wonder these things.\""]
["06:11,280","06:15,280","\"And if it blows itself, you know, doesn't it?\""]
["06:15,280","06:19,280","\"Like, to all three heads feel pleasure or just the two that aren't the ones doing the blowing?\""]
["06:19,280","06:23,280","\"Exactly. This is the questions that keep me up at night.\""]
["06:23,280","06:28,280","\"I always thought Disney's Hercules Hydra was one of the coolest designs.\""]
["06:28,280","06:33,800","\"Oh, yeah, I thought it was always weird that it just started with one head and it's like up until this point\""]
["06:33,800","06:39,320","\"It has never had to grow other heads. So everyone's sort of learning at that moment, but that's what a hydra is\""]
["06:39,320","06:42,040","\"That's why they oh, that's a hydra. Okay\""]
["06:42,040","06:48,920","\"Like this thing is fucking huge by the way. I remember when I saw this on the ps2. I was like oh, it's so big\""]
["06:48,920","06:55,280","\"Yeah, this blew me away and all the chanting makes it feel really cool, too. Yeah, that's true\""]
["06:55,280","07:01,400","\"That's Gerard K. Marino's like you know that cartoon I did on the new grounds the theme song with the Bissard lyrics\""]

["07:17,280","07:22,160","\"I'm like, okay. He's never did but it was so cool. That's cool. I was a pretty cool owner\""]
["07:22,600","07:26,120","\"It was really nice. He emailed me and he was like hey\""]
["07:26,120","07:30,360","\"This song is gonna be in guitar hero 3 as dental double content\""]
["07:30,360","07:35,360","\"But since you were you were so cool you can have it before anyone else you sent it to me like months before it came out\""]
["07:35,360","07:38,920","\"That's really cool. Yeah, I was like he just gave you a coat or something\""]

["08:05,580","08:06,580","\"he's slippery.\""]
["08:06,580","08:09,580","\"I was just like a fucking 17 year old that could have leaked it.\""]
["08:09,580","08:10,580","\"It's true.\""]
