["00:48,120","00:51,120","\"This is the highest level when I want to get through it without dying.\""]
["00:51,120","00:55,120","\"Just because it has the biggest number doesn't mean it has the biggest heart.\""]

["00:56,120","00:58,120","\"I bet Kingdom Hearts would have heart levels.\""]
["00:58,120","01:02,680","\"levels probably they would tell you to cry on your controller\""]

["01:08,400","01:14,000","\"team and they started crying no kind of I was like no I was going\""]
["01:14,000","01:20,280","\"or whatever he was like I'm a vocal coach and I can tell that you're exerting\""]
["01:20,280","01:24,000","\"a lot of you're exerting a lot in your voice you should just do it more calm\""]

["01:28,960","01:38,480","\"*mimics sound* so what'd you say to him? I was like \"\"no you're okay\"\" that's fine who's this awkward as hell?\""]
["01:38,480","01:50,720","\"you should have just told him to leave. I like PUBG it's so fun though it's broken and it's broken\""]
["01:50,720","01:51,920","\"They need to fix it.\""]
["01:51,920","01:53,600","\"They're not going to.\""]
["01:53,600","01:55,440","\"Did I tell you that I'm the title?\""]
["01:55,440","01:59,200","\"Like the main screen of PUBG, there's a little box that says \"\"Fix PUBG\"\"\""]
["01:59,200","02:03,920","\"and you click on it and it says \"\"We're trying really, really hard to fix PUBG.\"\"\""]

["02:05,280","02:08,320","\"They tell you that they made PUBG actually less fun because\""]

["02:15,040","02:17,120","\"I know, it was fun and they took that away now.\""]
["02:17,120","02:19,760","\"I guess because I mean, whenever we were there and watching you,\""]
["02:19,760","02:25,200","\"would just be like it's wearing it each other. Yeah, it's funny. It's not that much of a loss.\""]
["02:25,200","02:26,320","\"It had a charm to it.\""]
["02:26,320","02:34,880","\"Oh. I sure am glad that all children around the world can scream in unison on the internet at\""]
["02:34,880","02:39,680","\"each other. Where are they doing that now? I guess Fortnite. Yeah, Fortnite. Can you do a\""]

["04:41,540","04:48,540","\"It's pretty good actually. It's a pretty good impression of himself.\""]
["04:48,540","04:50,540","\"Yeah.\""]
