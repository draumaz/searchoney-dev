["03:25,920","03:27,420","\"Oh, this is good. Yeah\""]
["03:27,420","03:29,420","\"You just shot a flare up\""]
["03:29,420","03:35,360","\"He's behind that tree. Maybe don't hide behind a fucking tree you idiot. I think he's hiding from the side\""]
["03:35,360","03:39,100","\"Turn left. I thought he was behind that tree. Oh, he was that far. Okay\""]
["03:42,740","03:47,380","\"Where are you going? Oh my god. Oh my god. What's happening? I'm trying to knife you\""]
["03:47,380","03:50,620","\"What there's not a lot of animation\""]

["03:55,420","03:59,140","\"You made a wood you made a wood girl\""]
["03:59,140","04:07,180","\"Buddy what is with this fucking fog wall over here? That is actually epic scary\""]
["04:07,180","04:09,940","\"Yeah, that's pretty I love your wood arms sticky out like that\""]
["04:10,060","04:15,060","\"This reminds me of the thing that me and Niall made like 20 years ago. Oh, there's another one over there\""]
["04:15,060","04:22,900","\"You and I actually made a finished game 20 years ago. No, we made a beef boy demo and it just felt and looked exactly like this\""]
["04:22,900","04:26,260","\"I'll make it in unity\""]
["04:26,260","04:31,180","\"I'll take some footage and I'll compare it. It's pretty similar. Look the way the hand stays out\""]
["04:31,180","04:35,300","\"Was do you think it's really really else? Oh, no, this is unreal\""]
["04:35,300","04:39,980","\"Yeah, they said it was the unreal real runtime. It was down on real engine runs\""]
["04:39,980","04:44,180","\"It always feels more optimized than unity for some reason one real\""]
["04:44,180","04:49,420","\"I think a big part is it unreal is C++ so it compiles it like a lower level. Oh\""]
["04:49,420","04:56,300","\"So you should get some more bang for your buck out of the system wait, I just realized\""]
["04:56,300","05:02,040","\"This is a horror game. No. Yeah, why the fuck is the percussion track some guy going\""]
["05:03,020","05:06,580","\"There's also no horror of us. What's the scale you play? You just fight the people in a huge wasteland?\""]
["05:06,580","05:09,260","\"Yeah, you're just following little flared\""]
["05:09,260","05:11,820","\"Thing I think I heard someone over here\""]
["05:11,820","05:15,380","\"Yep, they just fired another one you there\""]
["05:15,380","05:19,580","\"So all I'm doing in this level is walking in the challenge you just\""]
["05:19,580","05:27,740","\"Okay, so the idea is that you're just helping in all these ways. Oh my god, that's scary\""]
["05:27,740","05:29,900","\"So like save people from a global pandemic\""]
["05:30,780","05:36,780","\"So we're not gonna lie. That kind of looks like you a little bit you know doesn't I don't have freckles. It's too hard to Jim when he's pissed off\""]
["05:36,780","05:41,620","\"And I have a big beard and a ball. How does that look a thing like me?\""]
["05:41,620","05:43,340","\"Well, we went to Jim a couple days ago\""]
["05:43,340","05:47,220","\"There's a little girl to jump rope, but you literally grabbed by the ponytails and throw it into submits\""]
["05:47,220","05:50,160","\"Then you hunger up over the roof things. Yeah\""]
["05:50,160","05:57,920","\"But despite all that what does that have to do with that guy looking like me? Oh, that's a good point. I'm sorry. I take it\""]
["05:59,420","06:01,420","\"I think you know what I was thinking of.\""]
["06:01,420","06:02,420","\"I was analog.\""]
["06:02,420","06:03,420","\"What?\""]
["06:03,420","06:04,420","\"Oh, would you ever forgive me?\""]
["06:04,420","06:05,420","\"I think this game might suck.\""]
["06:05,420","06:06,420","\"I'm not.\""]
["06:06,420","06:07,420","\"Maybe.\""]
["06:07,420","06:08,420","\"Chris.\""]
["06:08,420","06:12,420","\"I think you might definitely not don't play this for two hours.\""]
["06:12,420","06:13,420","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:13,420","06:16,420","\"I don't think that's going to be a problem, but please request a refund.\""]
["06:16,420","06:19,420","\"I wish you a fucking truck that we could get to travel.\""]
["06:19,420","06:25,420","\"I understand that wheel travel was like a very avant-garde obscure kind of game.\""]
["06:25,420","06:28,420","\"But this, come on.\""]
["06:28,420","06:32,500","\"I literally said the Veronica before you got here like when a piss off tomer so bad today\""]
["06:32,500","06:38,860","\"We're what okay, it's over here the new person\""]
["06:38,860","06:46,020","\"It's right all the trees are exactly the same. There's no interesting just that is my belief in capitalism Chris\""]
["06:46,020","06:48,120","\"We should not reward people who make trash\""]
["06:48,120","06:53,740","\"Like that it's fucking scary. Yeah, they welcome to the weapon like\""]
["06:56,180","07:00,640","\"Thruity you so what is that's it right we're the other family one more we need to fight one more little guy\""]
["07:00,640","07:02,280","\"Okay\""]
["07:02,280","07:06,140","\"These people weapons right up right to your face look get up at your face get up your grill\""]
["07:06,140","07:11,560","\"This is what leopard dad was like based on before they stole the entire concept. Yeah, this was actually the original leopard dad\""]
["07:11,560","07:16,200","\"I think valve like you know got sued over this. I hate that\""]
["07:16,200","07:23,560","\"Also, I'm pretty sure these are these all this clap may qualify as like an acid swap game\""]
["07:23,720","07:27,000","\"Why is there like stock like like scored music?\""]
["07:27,000","07:34,160","\"It's like red scooby doo music like I think this is because there's a unreal has an unreal store similar to the unity store\""]
["07:34,160","07:36,640","\"Where you can just like buy pre fabricated to bars?\""]
["07:36,640","07:43,540","\"I think this is just to bar this is asset flipping as they call it. Oh, you're kisses at hugs are unreal\""]
["07:43,540","07:49,400","\"And that didn't expect that\""]
["07:51,800","07:53,800","\"This sucks I think it's like made a show\""]
["07:53,800","08:05,360","\"How is she doing that I want to do a ghost dude she's having trouble figuring out what plane she's supposed to walk on\""]
["08:05,360","08:08,620","\"One more survivor do it would happen to him. Oh\""]
["08:08,620","08:14,840","\"We're we're still here. We're good. Yeah, looking for flares. I guess we need to find one more\""]
["08:14,840","08:18,280","\"Or just you know stop playing this harm\""]
["08:20,480","08:25,200","\"level that's amazing level the fuck is this somebody's clings to be down with\""]
