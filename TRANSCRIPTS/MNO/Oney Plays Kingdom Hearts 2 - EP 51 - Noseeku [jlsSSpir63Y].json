["06:11,260","06:17,280","\"But they keep kind of proving otherwise almost like that's not true or something. I don't know\""]
["06:17,280","06:25,740","\"Maybe I didn't need to fight him after all hello, my name is rika. Maybe I have to kill him after all\""]
["06:26,100","06:31,700","\"Maybe I didn't have to kill all of them after all maybe murder was a little dressed in I\""]

["12:56,100","13:03,060","\"They're trying to swap them out of the air\""]
["13:03,060","13:07,300","\"That's mine. Oh\""]
["13:07,300","13:10,460","\"No, you would have had to just put yourself in\""]

["13:38,740","13:43,460","\"Know you said that was a dangerous situation, but I'm glad we all agreed we needed a rest\""]
["13:43,460","13:49,520","\"He keeps fighting something good about the situation\""]
["13:49,520","13:58,380","\"No, who cares about Kyrie now you must call me no see cool\""]
["14:08,140","14:10,740","\"Now his brain is scrambled he can only say oh\""]

["15:17,300","15:21,420","\"Say that again\""]
["15:21,420","15:27,060","\"Like every time they met it like they saw him in the previous game something uncomfortable or bad\""]
["15:27,060","15:29,660","\"Yeah, it's because he was causing most of it exactly\""]
["15:29,660","15:34,660","\"We do, Rico. We must defeat Zemnas. He's the organization's last time.\""]
["15:34,660","15:39,660","\"How many people here start with an X? I can't keep track, you know.\""]

["16:16,980","16:21,100","\"No, I'm talking to ding dong. Yeah, I don't care. You've got a boner. No\""]
["16:21,100","16:26,620","\"Yeah, that was a little defensive. No, no you're the one trying to start a thing Chris\""]
["16:26,620","16:32,700","\"Hey, I'm just looking at your boner and I can see Rico was there a reason you wanted nude Sora hacked into the game Chris\""]
["16:32,700","16:34,900","\"Yeah, why because\""]
["16:34,900","16:37,380","\"Rico is here\""]
["16:37,380","16:40,860","\"Rico's here\""]

["16:47,820","16:53,820","\"I'm just saying admit it. Did they just do that thing to Sora and Riku that I do the Kairi at the end of the series\""]
["16:53,820","16:55,820","\"Yes, there we go. The laser boys\""]
["16:55,820","16:58,820","\"It's a good name for a show.\""]
["16:58,820","17:00,460","\"The laser boys.\""]
["17:00,460","17:01,460","\"I would watch it.\""]
["17:01,460","17:04,060","\"What is it about?\""]
["17:04,060","17:08,860","\"Two boys shine a laser in each other's eyes at the same time.\""]
["17:08,860","17:10,900","\"Either they become the laser boys.\""]
["17:10,900","17:11,900","\"Like over and over again?\""]
["17:11,900","17:16,620","\"They both become blind in one eye so they both need to use the other guy's eye to see\""]
["17:16,620","17:17,620","\"depth of field.\""]
["17:17,620","17:19,380","\"That would be awful.\""]
["17:19,380","17:23,340","\"Because what I'm thinking with laser boys, I was starting to think of like beetle boards\""]
["17:23,340","17:27,340","\"or something that the premise would be that you have to shine laser pointers into each\""]
["17:27,340","17:29,340","\"other's eyes to turn into them.\""]
["17:29,340","17:31,340","\"They solve all their problems with laser pointers.\""]
["17:31,340","17:36,780","\"Could you imagine a show getting greenlit that was just like teaching kids the worst values\""]

["17:37,780","17:39,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["17:39,380","17:42,340","\"I have to stick a fork in the outlet if I want to transform.\""]

["17:43,500","17:44,500","\"I wonder if I can get it.\""]
["17:44,500","17:45,500","\"I remember those.\""]
["17:45,500","17:49,180","\"Wasn't that a little bit of controversy with Persona 3 because the way they activate their\""]
["17:49,180","17:51,340","\"things and is that they shoot themselves on the head.\""]
["17:51,340","17:52,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["17:52,340","17:57,160","\"It's a cool idea though. I like the yeah, so you say it's fucking awesome, dude\""]
["17:57,160","17:59,560","\"Not what I meant Chris\""]
["17:59,560","18:03,700","\"That's my joke. I'm sorry. Hey, that's the joke of the episode\""]
["18:03,700","18:09,180","\"No, no, I would need glide to get that one. I think oh you don't have glide\""]
["18:09,180","18:14,280","\"I am you have to use the final form and level it up all the way to the for me before me\""]
["18:14,280","18:20,560","\"Aww look at him. I think of these guys. Oh, he's my priest. Oh\""]
["18:21,000","18:23,000","\"Oh\""]
["18:23,000","18:31,360","\"What my way to please did I ever tell you that one time of church in the holy water\""]
["18:31,360","18:33,360","\"I dip my finger in when I took it out\""]
["18:33,360","18:42,760","\"Dirty here dirty here. Yeah, so that's water. Yep dirty holy water because all the old people dip their fucking old finger\""]
["18:42,760","18:46,680","\"You know what that's true. I never thought about that. That's probably not super hygienic\""]
["18:46,680","18:51,320","\"So then my pre-scared porn bleaching damn thing and now my finger is gone\""]
["18:51,320","18:54,160","\"And I caught everybody's disease\""]
["18:54,160","18:59,840","\"My skin's rotting off. I may have put a bleaching finger on my mouth\""]
["18:59,840","19:05,680","\"Why do you make a taste it in a bit\""]
["19:05,680","19:09,300","\"That's why I shit bleached into the bathtub\""]
["19:09,300","19:14,560","\"I'm sure you never know that I tried to bleach my bottle to get it out. That didn't work\""]
["19:14,560","19:21,080","\"So I fingered my butthole with my bleacher finger and then of course I had to taste it and then I taste my dog\""]
["19:21,080","19:23,680","\"taste my dog\""]
["19:23,680","19:25,680","\"And then I kicked my neighbor\""]
["19:25,680","19:31,920","\"That was about the time when my clock broke and I threw it on to my son's head killed it\""]
["19:31,920","19:36,720","\"Tell we're here now by the way\""]
