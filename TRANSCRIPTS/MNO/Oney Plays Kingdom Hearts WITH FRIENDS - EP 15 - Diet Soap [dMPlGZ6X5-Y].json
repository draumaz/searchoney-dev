["06:10,480","06:13,280","\"They should make a game that's just the sids.\""]
["06:13,280","06:14,280","\"It's called SID.\""]
["06:14,280","06:15,280","\"It's called SID.\""]

["06:32,760","06:35,160","\"This eyes are so fucking weird.\""]
["06:35,160","06:38,420","\"What would you do if you met a person with eyes like that in real life?\""]
["06:38,420","06:44,520","\"Let's say hey, I'd give them my key blade. I wouldn't bring up their eyes at all because I'd feel like it would offend them\""]

["07:04,240","07:07,440","\"This is the middle. It's more like the fucking first sixth\""]
["07:07,440","07:13,520","\"That's the truth. You haven't even gotten to the hollow bastion yet. No, it's the end of the game\""]
["07:13,520","07:16,960","\"No, it's not it's like halfway through it's like\""]
["07:16,960","07:22,060","\"It's like 75% you serious. It's a run the end of the game\""]
["07:22,060","07:24,480","\"You know I was younger\""]
["07:24,480","07:29,320","\"It was like halfway. I mean, it's a really long level. I guess this game is really fucking long\""]
["07:29,320","07:32,320","\"It is it's only because they padded out so much stupid shit\""]
["07:32,320","07:34,400","\"There's\""]

["07:45,800","07:48,360","\"I guess it is no is it?\""]
["07:48,360","07:54,000","\"You can't spell Sora without soap so soap\""]
["07:54,000","07:57,800","\"Who's talking about diet so me? Oh?\""]
["07:57,800","07:58,300","\"Oh.\""]
["07:58,300","08:00,400","\"You want some?\""]
["08:00,400","08:01,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:01,100","08:03,500","\"Do you eat it or do you just use it?\""]
["08:03,500","08:06,300","\"You eat it and then you use it.\""]
["08:06,300","08:09,800","\"When I pick it up, when you use normal soaps, your skin absorbs the calories.\""]
["08:09,800","08:13,500","\"You eat the soap, you shit it out and then it's diet soap and then you use it.\""]
["08:13,500","08:16,300","\"It's just shit.\""]
["08:16,300","08:17,700","\"It's just shit.\""]
["08:17,700","08:19,200","\"No, it's diet soap.\""]
["08:19,200","08:22,100","\"Well, how does that make a diet soap?\""]
["08:22,100","08:24,300","\"Because it's like lower in calories.\""]
["08:24,300","08:27,600","\"You're supposed to eat soap to begin with.\""]
["08:27,600","08:29,600","\"What it's just fat.\""]
["08:29,600","08:31,600","\"Remember the fucking scene that Rens didn't be\""]
["08:31,600","08:32,600","\"where he thinks it's this.\""]
["08:32,600","08:33,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:33,600","08:34,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:34,600","08:35,600","\"Very vividly.\""]
["08:35,600","08:37,600","\"Because everyone thinks it looks good.\""]
["08:37,600","08:39,600","\"It does.\""]
["08:39,600","08:41,600","\"I love the way he chews it.\""]
["08:41,600","08:42,600","\"It looks really satisfying.\""]
["08:42,600","08:44,600","\"I mean obviously you're not supposed to feel that way.\""]
["08:44,600","08:47,600","\"You're supposed to be really grossed out.\""]
["08:47,600","08:48,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:48,600","08:49,600","\"But it never was.\""]
["08:49,600","08:51,600","\"It really comes across as like white chocolate or something.\""]
["08:51,600","08:55,600","\"It's because he, I think normal soap would be really hard to bite into,\""]
["08:55,600","08:58,600","\"his teeth sink into it very easily.\""]
["08:58,600","09:01,960","\"- I mean, you never use soap, Julian.\""]
["09:01,960","09:03,320","\"- You use soap?\""]
["09:03,320","09:05,080","\"I just don't like bar soap.\""]
["09:05,080","09:05,920","\"- Why not?\""]
["09:05,920","09:06,760","\"- Use body wash.\""]
["09:06,760","09:09,080","\"- Like I'm cartoon pizza, the cheese is always really drippy.\""]
["09:09,080","09:10,440","\"- Heart soap is better.\""]
["09:10,440","09:12,160","\"- Because--\""]
["09:12,160","09:13,560","\"- It gives you that squeaky clean feeling.\""]
["09:13,560","09:14,400","\"- Well, that's the thing.\""]
["09:14,400","09:17,400","\"It makes my skin feel like really,\""]
["09:17,400","09:20,160","\"like it increases the friction somehow.\""]
["09:20,160","09:21,480","\"And I don't like how that feels.\""]
["09:21,480","09:22,320","\"- I like it.\""]
["09:22,320","09:25,120","\"Makes me feel clean or--\""]
["09:25,120","09:27,120","\"I'm trying to think now there was something else.\""]
["09:27,120","09:29,400","\"It's when someone, what?\""]
["09:29,400","09:30,480","\"It was an animated movie.\""]
["09:30,480","09:32,600","\"They dip a cracker in water and they made it look a lot\""]
["09:32,600","09:34,840","\"better than it should have been.\""]
["09:34,840","09:37,440","\"Oh, have you seen--\""]
["09:37,440","09:38,520","\"An animated thing?\""]
["09:38,520","09:40,320","\"That part, and I think we talked about it before,\""]
