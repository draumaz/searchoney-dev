["06:58,240","07:05,840","\"Watching you play it is definitely you can tell it you're you know what you're doing because you're not clearly wrestling with turning around and shit\""]
["07:05,840","07:10,720","\"Yeah, it's got its own weird like tank controls thing, but\""]
["07:10,720","07:16,620","\"Once you used to it. It's it's fun. I guarantee you there's plenty of way better players out there\""]
["07:16,620","07:23,140","\"than me that make more use of like, you know, like, like the, the, the rush in this is at\""]
["07:23,140","07:29,080","\"least a level of like passable semi-competence. I, I say this is somebody who spends the majority\""]
["07:29,080","07:35,940","\"of his time like rolling diagonally instead of turning around and shit. So, you know,\""]
["07:35,940","07:41,140","\"I think every game ever made, you know something? You know what? What? I think they always use\""]
["07:41,140","07:45,500","\"the best song in the first level every last time. I think there's a bunch of good songs\""]
["07:45,500","07:50,300","\"No, but this is the most recognizable good one. This is what everyone hums long\""]
["07:50,300","07:55,940","\"This is like the katamari theme. Yeah, like Mario has the dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah\""]
["07:55,940","07:59,340","\"Yeah, that's the first level. It's rage first leveled best song\""]
["07:59,340","08:06,220","\"Yeah, I mean obviously you want to make a strong first impression. Yeah doom doom's another one. Yeah\""]
["08:06,220","08:12,780","\"Okay, I can't say that green Hills own you know you think green Hills own is the best in that game\""]
["08:12,780","08:18,380","\"I think maybe you're really gonna do Mikey dirty like that Mikey Michael Jackson dog\""]
["08:18,380","08:21,820","\"He's not in the first game. He's in the third one\""]
["08:21,820","08:28,300","\"Ooh, yeah, so if a creature runs away that means that there's you're big enough to capture them. Oh, that's cool\""]
["08:28,300","08:33,980","\"Fucking kill that rat get him. Do you grow with your ball? Yeah, kind of okay\""]
["08:33,980","08:39,480","\"Who left all the steps to go over here? Oh disgusting white\""]

["09:26,840","09:30,260","\"Does the music go to the exact time of the level no oh?\""]
["09:30,260","09:37,520","\"I think it switches tracks if it ever gets to the end of the song, but in this case that the song is\""]
["09:38,280","09:44,180","\"Think longer than the level are there levels that don't have time limits. I don't think so\""]
["09:44,180","09:47,520","\"Because eventually you just pick up everything right\""]
["09:47,520","09:51,960","\"Well, there are definitely levels where the objective isn't to grow big\""]
["09:51,960","09:59,020","\"It's to like get the largest of a particular thing, but if you accidentally get like a smaller version it just ends\""]
["09:59,020","10:03,560","\"Those are definitely my least favorite levels, so I'm not gonna play any of them\""]
["10:03,560","10:07,240","\"Yeah, those are those are optional levels\""]

["41:42,960","41:44,600","\"like quote unquote scientist,\""]
["41:44,600","41:45,800","\"and everything that he does,\""]

["42:03,700","42:07,420","\"but maybe if we put it in a steel tube,\""]
["42:07,420","42:09,180","\"so it's isolated from everything,\""]
["42:09,180","42:10,340","\"and then it does it again.\""]
