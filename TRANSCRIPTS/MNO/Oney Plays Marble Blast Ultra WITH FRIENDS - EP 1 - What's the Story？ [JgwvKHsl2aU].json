["00:26,860","00:28,720","\"No girls, no gays.\""]
["00:28,720","00:30,720","\"A while too late for that.\""]
["00:30,720","00:32,720","\"Is this... am I a sphere?\""]
["00:32,720","00:34,720","\"You're a little glob.\""]
["00:34,720","00:35,720","\"This looks fun.\""]
["00:35,720","00:37,720","\"You're a pearlescent tumor.\""]
["00:37,720","00:39,720","\"Use the right stick.\""]
["00:39,720","00:41,720","\"This was one of my favorites on the 360.\""]
["00:41,720","00:43,720","\"Too bad they took the game down.\""]
["00:43,720","00:44,720","\"So how do you play this game?\""]
["00:44,720","00:46,720","\"You literally just roll?\""]
["00:46,720","00:47,720","\"You just roll.\""]
["00:47,720","00:50,720","\"So it's just like a character that's running,\""]
["00:50,720","00:52,720","\"but they move really fast.\""]
["00:52,720","00:54,720","\"And you get on the finished pad.\""]
["00:54,720","00:55,720","\"You're a ball.\""]
["00:55,720","00:56,720","\"It's got physics.\""]
["00:56,720","00:57,720","\"Congratulations, you're a ball.\""]
["00:57,720","01:02,120","\"Congratulations you won I now go to next level level 2\""]
["01:02,120","01:07,000","\"The super jump can be used Julian. It's your favorite\""]
["01:07,000","01:10,760","\"Oh\""]
["01:10,760","01:14,720","\"And if you use the right bumper when that meter fills up you can\""]
["01:14,720","01:17,640","\"Pop yourself in the area. Oh my goodness\""]
["01:17,640","01:23,680","\"I just remember this because while I was learning to use Photoshop and illustrator in high school all the other kids were playing this game\""]
["01:23,680","01:26,160","\"And so they probably didn't learn anything\""]
["01:27,160","01:32,400","\"This is a cute little ball out over here the I would over here the sound effects while I was working I\""]
["01:32,400","01:36,200","\"Did it I?\""]
["01:36,200","01:42,800","\"Remember people would mod their 360 controllers to go faster in this game by cutting out the plastic around them really\""]
["01:42,800","01:46,640","\"Because this game wasn't coded for that. Oh\""]
["01:46,640","01:49,320","\"I didn't know that was the thing you could do I\""]
["01:49,320","01:54,520","\"Didn't know either, but apparently that was a thing people were doing. How does that do you stop in the timer?\""]
["01:55,440","02:00,740","\"That's cheating time or I guess it's right there at the top isn't where am I going you got to find the jams\""]
["02:00,740","02:04,840","\"The delicious strawberry jams, okay\""]
["02:04,840","02:08,760","\"Follow the air don't get a two more Chris\""]

["02:11,880","02:14,360","\"Why didn't they name him two more Simpson?\""]
["02:14,360","02:17,360","\"Why would they?\""]
["02:17,360","02:21,840","\"Why would they name him that Julia because tumors are generally\""]
["02:22,640","02:30,040","\"Pleasant to talk about I am too more Simpson. That's the whole family. There's Homer humor humor large\""]
["02:30,040","02:33,000","\"Marge\""]
["02:33,000","02:40,800","\"She like shaped like a barge charge. Oh, that's such a satisfying sound\""]

["02:49,120","02:52,500","\"Yeah, you can't get this game anymore in the 360 they delisted it\""]
["02:52,500","02:56,640","\"Which is too bad because this is one of the most fun games. I remember playing in the 36\""]
["02:56,640","02:59,700","\"Can you get it anywhere is it is it you can get the PC version?\""]
["02:59,700","03:01,700","\"So it's not the same game as this\""]
["03:01,700","03:08,280","\"Is it like a sequel or it's a it's a patch or what how to I forget what the PC one that everyone plays is\""]
["03:08,280","03:10,280","\"It's like level less gold or something\""]
["03:10,280","03:13,160","\"but\""]
["03:13,160","03:16,460","\"Wow, 361 is its own little experience seems a lot of fun\""]
["03:17,480","03:19,480","\"Well, then how come it's just a ball\""]
["03:19,480","03:22,120","\"Where's all the blood?\""]
["03:22,120","03:27,880","\"Chris simple things can be fun. Where's the smoke and physics? I wish there was a door piece of game\""]
["03:27,880","03:31,240","\"What would you do? I don't know the lessons?\""]

["04:01,520","04:07,960","\"You didn't think veggie tales was funny at all Chris. No, did you watch veggie tales when you're a kid?\""]
["04:07,960","04:13,220","\"The fuck go I don't know if that fits in with whatever whatever denomination Irishman's\""]
