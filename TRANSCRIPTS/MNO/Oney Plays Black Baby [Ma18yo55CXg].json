["00:58,700","00:59,700","\"What the fuck?\""]
["00:59,700","01:00,700","\"What the fuck?\""]

["01:05,220","01:07,060","\"There's a whole pink, white man.\""]
["01:07,060","01:09,060","\"There's some lore behind this.\""]
["01:09,060","01:12,740","\"Oh my gosh Jesus Christ that's scary.\""]
["01:12,740","01:13,740","\"That's really fucking scary.\""]
["01:13,740","01:14,740","\"This is really scary.\""]
["01:14,740","01:15,740","\"That's unnerving.\""]
["01:15,740","01:16,740","\"Look at their faces.\""]
["01:16,740","01:17,740","\"Get closer to them.\""]
["01:17,740","01:18,740","\"Hello?\""]

["01:19,740","01:21,180","\"Can you hear me sir?\""]
["01:21,180","01:24,700","\"I know you don't know who I am but I know you have been watching you and I know you're\""]
["01:24,700","01:26,180","\"good people with a good heart.\""]
["01:26,180","01:27,180","\"We're just different.\""]
["01:27,180","01:28,180","\"You and I?\""]
["01:28,180","01:30,180","\"*laughing*\""]
["01:30,180","01:31,180","\"I look at them just-\""]
["01:31,180","01:32,180","\"*screaming*\""]
["01:32,180","01:36,000","\"They kick you in the face and then immediately lose interest like they're like okay\""]
["01:36,000","01:40,820","\"We kicked it and something really unnerving about how they're acting. That's just like really creepy\""]
["01:40,820","01:43,420","\"But what is the little gold?\""]
["01:43,420","01:45,420","\"Which genre is this game supposed to be?\""]
["01:45,420","01:49,680","\"This game is literally based on that vine where the little black child runs around naked in his front yard.\""]
["01:49,680","01:50,680","\"Are you serious?\""]
["01:50,680","01:52,680","\"No, I swear to God it has to be.\""]
["01:52,680","01:53,680","\"And a mumble.\""]
["01:53,680","01:54,680","\"Get him!\""]
["01:54,680","02:00,640","\"He looks like broads or gold or something looks like C3P. Oh, so is oh\""]
["02:00,640","02:08,740","\"That's he looks like you guys remember that song fucking blue. He looks like the fucking CG on that\""]
["02:08,740","02:14,880","\"That's so is this just a dead-head. Can you walk through like Mario? Can you try to jump through it?\""]
["02:14,880","02:18,820","\"I don't think I could do anything. There was a screenshot showing you with an axe\""]
["02:18,820","02:22,080","\"So they're possible for the black baby to fight back\""]
["02:23,720","02:28,760","\"Yeah, go left here. Oh my I hate that look look at that. Why would you make this fucking game?\""]
["02:28,760","02:33,280","\"That's really fucking scary. I kind of want to do look at his head. He's got like a big dead-dead head\""]
["02:33,280","02:35,280","\"Look at this\""]
["02:35,280","02:46,840","\"Okay, so we're starting to okay, there's puzzle over here. You're making this is the new Zelda you're making something resembling progress\""]
["02:46,840","02:53,360","\"Okay, there we go. Yes. Yes. This is the result of the dungeon. I like it. Yeah, go go back to that thing\""]
["02:53,360","02:56,560","\"Fuck carry it in its skull. Oh, you Chris hit him\""]
["02:56,560","03:02,200","\"What oh fuck no, I think this this man might still have the all the power\""]
["03:02,200","03:04,960","\"This guys a god in this world still\""]
["03:04,960","03:09,040","\"Play God when you do that get out of there now\""]
["03:09,040","03:15,200","\"Can I wake up the stairs? Oh my god, they look at that\""]
["03:15,200","03:18,520","\"I don't think they can I don't think they're capable of a little they're a little afraid of that\""]
["03:18,520","03:23,340","\"Okay, did this again? I might be dying. Yep. Fuck it out get out get out little black baby\""]
["03:23,340","03:26,880","\"Where's your health? Does it say I think it's that - in the top left corner\""]
["03:26,880","03:32,320","\"What would you do Zack if you open the door and you saw you literally just that it's pretty like that yeah a\""]
["03:32,320","03:38,360","\"Bronze little black baby walking upright. Go you probably run over to it and kick it naked\""]
["03:38,360","03:43,280","\"I'd walk over died right first of all I just myself and shaped my head completely down to the skin\""]
["03:45,400","03:51,880","\"What is that the GTA rolling animation? I think this game stole the GTA animation\""]
["03:51,880","03:55,520","\"This is using the fucking euphoria\""]
["03:55,520","04:03,360","\"What does that answer your fucking qua okay back to the beginning? I think I just have to redo all that\""]
["04:03,360","04:09,120","\"I caught a little way to start off though. It's like you versus this giant white man. That's fucking scary\""]
["04:11,120","04:14,560","\"Okay, you go left right here. I think but is that a dead end?\""]
["04:14,560","04:20,000","\"Yeah, I think you made a lot of progress, so we didn't get sit back too bad. Does that give me a little sound effects there I go?\""]
["04:20,000","04:26,520","\"Are you crash the game hey loud do footsteps\""]
["04:26,520","04:32,120","\"What can I do talk is these guys\""]
["04:32,120","04:36,480","\"Hello, I've seen you guys around here\""]
["04:36,480","04:42,480","\"Stop. I think it works out that app. I think we can work out.\""]
["04:42,480","04:44,480","\"Noooooo!\""]
["04:44,480","04:46,480","\"Stop!\""]
["04:46,480","04:50,480","\"Well you do the slapping sound when they kick him okay?\""]
["04:50,480","04:51,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:51,480","04:58,480","\"Hey, I don't know if you can hear me but I've seen you guys around here. I think we can make a tree knee of some kind.\""]
["04:58,480","05:02,480","\"You seem scary but I think you guys could be good people with the end.\""]
["05:02,480","05:06,640","\"You've got wives children brothers and sisters just like me\""]
["05:06,640","05:11,600","\"Thank you for that kick of me I appreciate that\""]
["05:11,600","05:19,480","\"This is fucking what this is psychotic. I genuinely want to know what the fuck was the person making this thinking?\""]
["05:19,480","05:25,120","\"He should keep adding to it. I love this. I love this shit. It's actually very scary speaking of side effects\""]
["05:25,120","05:29,120","\"I just realized it is the volume down or is just no sound in this\""]
["05:29,120","05:32,440","\"- Yeah, no, we've had sound for every other game.\""]
["05:32,440","05:34,400","\"- This had to have been made.\""]
["05:34,400","05:35,600","\"- There's the axe.\""]
["05:35,600","05:38,840","\"- Like this doesn't seem like you think of this idea\""]
["05:38,840","05:39,680","\"and make this.\""]
["05:39,680","05:41,640","\"This seems like an attempt to make something else\""]
["05:41,640","05:44,120","\"that was like given up on or...\""]
["05:44,120","05:45,760","\"- I honestly think he just had some assets\""]
["05:45,760","05:47,440","\"and he just threw them all together, maybe.\""]
["05:47,440","05:48,800","\"- This could have been like a bad dream he had to,\""]
["05:48,800","05:51,160","\"he just decided to make it 'cause he was stressed out about it.\""]
["05:51,160","05:52,400","\"- A little bronze black baby.\""]
["05:52,400","05:54,040","\"- I guess this would fucking set you.\""]
["05:54,040","05:54,880","\"- God damn it.\""]
["05:54,880","05:58,560","\"- Pretty profoundly, if you had it kicking around in your mind.\""]
["05:58,560","06:02,020","\"He didn't code in to keep the mouse connected to this so I'm slightly\""]
["06:02,020","06:05,520","\"slightly scroll away from it and click it. Yeah, it's really annoying. I\""]
["06:05,520","06:08,800","\"Swear to God. This is the most fun. I've had playing a game so far\""]
["06:08,800","06:12,720","\"Hey, dude if you're out there listening to that dead if you've ever been kicked over by a giant man\""]
["06:12,720","06:16,080","\"Your brain is still ticking. Please keep adding this game\""]
["06:16,080","06:20,220","\"Yeah, keep please keep it up. It's amazing. I would honestly play the shit\""]
["06:20,220","06:25,580","\"I'm pretty sure we've established that number one you can cut wood, but number two you cannot kill these guys right?\""]
["06:25,580","06:27,080","\"Yeah, I don't think so\""]
["06:27,080","06:31,640","\"What the deal with the doors because there's certain certain ones of these that are like blocked off or they just\""]
["06:31,640","06:34,680","\"Maybe there's a way to open those get Bob's or something\""]
["06:34,680","06:40,640","\"This is a hardcore puzzle. I don't think the guy would have just uploaded this way. There we go\""]
["06:40,640","06:42,920","\"I found one. Oh, there you go. This is what I found. Yeah\""]
["06:42,920","06:47,280","\"There's a thing on the ground there's a thing on the ground. There's two things on the ground\""]
["06:47,280","06:52,280","\"You have to grab it. You have to grab it. Fuck this guy fuck this guy. I can't tell that's nothing\""]
["06:52,280","06:55,100","\"That's just a rock. Let's just be rocks or something\""]
["06:55,100","06:58,540","\"Can you attack the rocks or that asshole like there's that door there?\""]
["06:58,540","07:00,540","\"I think those might be like a knife\""]
["07:00,540","07:06,380","\"No, they're bones that this guy's kicked babies to death down here. Wait, so you see drop\""]
["07:06,380","07:09,820","\"You drop your fucking ass. Give me that way. No\""]
["07:09,820","07:13,760","\"This game is on play. No my baby. No, please\""]
["07:13,760","07:19,740","\"Like this when he when he kicked you you dropped your axe. Could you have picked up that knife for those?\""]
["07:20,860","07:25,820","\"Okay, we'll do we'll give it one more. I do see what what because it's like it crazy\""]
["07:25,820","07:30,340","\"Is it goes I could just get to be yeah? I want to see what the fuck the point of this is yeah\""]
["07:30,340","07:36,240","\"I don't know I genuinely don't know totally what this is supposed to be\""]
["07:36,240","07:43,000","\"Scary is it supposed to be I think it's surreal. I guess it's supposed to be a weird us surreal fucking sweet as well\""]
["07:43,000","07:45,000","\"Yeah, it's freakin\""]
["07:45,500","07:47,500","\"It's just a time I was a bronze baby.\""]
["07:47,500","07:48,500","\"Maybe you can jump.\""]
["07:48,500","07:49,500","\"Maybe you can crump.\""]
["07:49,500","07:51,500","\"You can do a double jump, by the way.\""]
["07:51,500","07:52,500","\"I saw the instructions.\""]
["07:52,500","07:53,500","\"Can you really?\""]
["07:53,500","07:55,500","\"No, but you should be able to...\""]
["07:55,500","07:59,500","\"Escape doesn't do anything, so we're stuck in this game forever now.\""]
["07:59,500","08:02,500","\"Okay, guys, keep these out of skateboard and a double jump to this game.\""]
["08:02,500","08:05,500","\"No, I like that the baby's bound to the ground.\""]
["08:05,500","08:06,500","\"It makes more sense.\""]
["08:06,500","08:07,500","\"We have a bunch of victory.\""]
["08:07,500","08:14,500","\"I'm a little victory animation.\""]
["08:14,500","08:19,560","\"I really that's really the scariest part right there. They're feeding it. I level with it. Yeah, he's like I already can't look at him\""]
["08:19,560","08:24,820","\"He's just the fuck I wonder if that's intentional placement because he's been there the whole time look at his head shape\""]
["08:24,820","08:28,780","\"This is what I feel like when I shave my head\""]
["08:28,780","08:36,660","\"Baby if I'll do that fucking axe\""]
["08:40,500","08:42,500","\"Have you tried dropping down there and\""]
["08:42,500","08:49,220","\"Or is that the same room from before that is a man. I think that's the same room. Yeah, it's so where you start up\""]
["08:49,220","08:54,060","\"It's a little it's a little as you breathe brave bad. Why do you brave babe? Do you fucking fool?\""]
["08:54,060","08:59,540","\"They're not gonna get me on the black baby your brave broads babe. They're faster than I am. Yeah very slightly\""]
["08:59,540","09:03,260","\"Yeah, so you got to go in here back to the start. Yeah, there you go\""]
["09:03,260","09:05,980","\"Yeah\""]
["09:05,980","09:10,340","\"Don't try to do it yet because obviously you want to smash that thing to button\""]

["09:13,680","09:17,540","\"You like you go here after you smash that board and fall into the thing\""]
["09:17,540","09:21,820","\"This is a fucking secret. Yeah after you smash\""]
["09:21,820","09:26,940","\"The thing to fall into the pit with the big guy see if there's a way to drop the axe\""]
["09:26,940","09:29,620","\"It tried right now. Can you drop the X right now? Oh you can throw?\""]
["09:29,620","09:31,860","\"Oh, holy shit, so you can throw it sweet\""]
["09:31,860","09:36,540","\"But you can throw it pick up because there's definitely that stuff. Yeah, maybe you throw it at the guy once a\""]
["09:37,540","09:42,380","\"Experiment here. I didn't do it in a room with two of them. Hey, buddy. I'm talking to you\""]
["09:42,380","09:51,740","\"Small baby, hey, I'm not afraid anymore. You hear that?\""]
