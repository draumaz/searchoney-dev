["01:44,880","01:51,880","\"Let's do it.\""]
["01:51,880","02:01,440","\"Would you like if Mario just clapped his hands down and he flew up into the sky and\""]

["02:08,960","02:15,960","\"Okay, I would be more amused if they added dirt physics to his gloves.\""]
["02:15,960","02:18,960","\"So that they get dynamically dirty?\""]

["02:22,960","02:23,960","\"That's my band.\""]
["02:23,960","02:26,960","\"That's dirty dynamics.\""]
["02:26,960","02:29,960","\"Dynamics processing?\""]
["02:29,960","02:34,960","\"Have you ever done a process so hard that you just couldn't deal with it no more?\""]

["02:41,160","02:44,520","\"Holy shit, I never knew that he bounces off of it what?\""]
["02:44,520","02:50,320","\"Because if he ever hits the ground with anything else he just sticks to the ground if he used this oh\""]
["02:50,320","02:53,480","\"He didn't do it there. It's because I held up\""]
["02:53,480","03:00,080","\"No, hang on. I think it's because I held up because I did it from over was it over there? I did it\""]
["03:00,080","03:02,840","\"Let me go back and do it again\""]
["03:02,840","03:05,200","\"This is maybe if you have to be a certain height\""]
["03:05,200","03:09,700","\"See you bounce over again. That's really cool\""]

["03:55,000","04:00,640","\"Stop slapping the cow. Sorry. You know what happens when you slap the cow music is really catchy\""]
