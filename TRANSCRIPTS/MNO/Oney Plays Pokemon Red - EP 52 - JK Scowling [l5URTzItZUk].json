["09:31,200","09:35,200","\"I kind of wish they didn't do that because I just like the idea of him being some random asshole who came home.\""]
["09:35,200","09:36,200","\"No, I agree with you.\""]
["09:36,200","09:39,200","\"And that he's just kind of like abusing Pokemon and everything.\""]

["10:20,000","10:22,900","\"Yeah, it was a very good idea for a fake Pokemon\""]
["10:22,900","10:30,100","\"Same with just you know stealing a sprite from another game and putting it over the Pokemon thing\""]
["10:30,100","10:34,580","\"Did you ever do any fake Pokemon when you were a kid Chris?\""]
["10:34,580","10:43,320","\"I don't think so you never made up any did you make your own fake trading cards?\""]
["10:43,320","10:46,140","\"The worst thing I ever did was I made up a fake\""]
["10:46,340","10:51,700","\"Cubics robot and entered it into a contest. I remember that contest. Did you win? No? Oh?\""]
["10:51,700","10:59,020","\"My idea wasn't very good. What was your idea? It was just weapon X. Oh, it was Cubics with a bunch of weapons\""]
["10:59,020","11:04,420","\"That's funny. I like it weapon X\""]
["11:04,420","11:08,540","\"I think I talked about the Pokemon snap contest\""]
["11:08,540","11:15,300","\"I actually entered it and I was like a finalist but I was too lazy to write an essay that they wanted. Oh, so that's why I\""]
["11:15,500","11:22,240","\"I didn't continue on with it. I found the commercial for the contest to roll back. It was like a trip to Australia or something\""]
["11:22,240","11:27,500","\"Yeah, and you know honestly, that's not very nice. So that's okay. I wouldn't be thrilled about that\""]
["11:27,500","11:29,480","\"I didn't even like you as a kid anyway now\""]
["11:29,480","11:35,500","\"I would appreciate it because yeah as I want to travel more but like as a kid you'd be like what would I do in Australia?\""]
["11:35,500","11:40,300","\"Yeah, I just I only wanted to win the cubic's thing just to say I got something on TV\""]
["11:40,300","11:42,780","\"I didn't even like you bigs. I hated you\""]
["11:42,780","11:50,360","\"How could you not like Cubics robots for everyone because it's really lame and stupid and everyone's a merry suit and it's boring\""]

["11:54,000","11:59,240","\"Okay, you might you may have a point do you even know which one that was because I don't it was the robot which robot\""]
["11:59,240","12:01,400","\"It was like the weird rabbit he won. Oh, yeah\""]
["12:01,400","12:06,300","\"You know what it's coming back now because we played the game that was really fun\""]
["12:06,300","12:11,060","\"I was flapping around because they didn't want to do proper lip-sync. I like that a lot by the way\""]
["12:11,580","12:17,260","\"The game was something why did they do it that way that everyone was just flapping their heads around because it's funny\""]

["12:20,780","12:25,140","\"Well, I'll stack watch as big thing crushes puppy no\""]
["12:25,140","12:32,020","\"Call it puppy no if you ever have it that's the name of the the pizza tower\""]
["12:32,020","12:37,780","\"Oh, yeah, his name is pet Pino put that name for it is especially for a chef. I think oh\""]
["12:39,260","12:41,260","\"Oh, and now the horse died too.\""]
["12:41,260","12:44,260","\"I love Kirlin for fun. No less.\""]
["12:44,260","12:47,260","\"No more, no less.\""]
["12:47,260","12:48,260","\"Owoo!\""]
["12:48,260","12:50,260","\"Shh!\""]
["12:50,260","12:53,260","\"That's what I was thinking.\""]
["12:53,260","12:55,260","\"Melissa and Mike.\""]
["12:55,260","12:56,260","\"Yeah.\""]
["12:56,260","12:58,260","\"He's going owoo!\""]
["12:58,260","13:02,260","\"This guy has been in here just making Halloween noises at himself the whole time.\""]
["13:02,260","13:03,260","\"And everyone in the other room.\""]
["13:03,260","13:04,260","\"Shh!\""]
["13:04,260","13:06,260","\"They're all yelling at him.\""]
["13:06,260","13:08,260","\"The one thing I don't like about Mike and Melissa.\""]
["13:08,260","13:10,860","\"- The one thing on one thing.\""]
["13:10,860","13:13,840","\"- Is that all of the other voices he supplies\""]
["13:13,840","13:15,900","\"for the other characters are super raspy.\""]
["13:15,900","13:17,960","\"So every time someone screams, it's,\""]
["13:17,960","13:19,460","\"(screams)\""]
["13:19,460","13:20,540","\"and it's like grating.\""]
["13:20,540","13:21,700","\"- Yeah.\""]
["13:21,700","13:22,860","\"- What are you talking about?\""]
["13:22,860","13:24,780","\"- Especially because that's just how we characterize\""]
["13:24,780","13:26,300","\"as people he doesn't like.\""]
["13:26,300","13:27,660","\"He does it too.\""]
["13:27,660","13:28,500","\"They all do it.\""]
["13:28,500","13:30,180","\"- I guess that's true, he does scream.\""]
["13:30,180","13:31,060","\"- That one guy goes,\""]
["13:31,060","13:34,300","\"\"\"Please don't leave me!\"\"\""]
["13:34,300","13:36,180","\"The other guy goes, \"\"Ach, hold on.\"\"\""]
["13:36,180","13:39,260","\"He goes, \"\"Don't pee on that tree, asshole.\"\"\""]
["13:39,260","13:42,420","\"- And then he does it right there even.\""]
["13:42,420","13:44,020","\"'Cause he goes, \"\"I just wanted to--\"\"\""]
["13:44,020","13:45,520","\"- Why, sherry!\""]
["13:45,520","13:46,840","\"- Am I sherry?\""]
["13:46,840","13:50,300","\"- I think it's weird that his pee stream jerks up\""]
["13:50,300","13:53,260","\"when he says that as if he's got a boner.\""]
["13:53,260","13:56,020","\"It's not because he shifted his stance or something.\""]
["13:56,020","13:58,140","\"- Do you think that is a subtle detail\""]
["13:58,140","13:59,380","\"he put in intentionally?\""]
["13:59,380","14:00,540","\"- No, I think it's a mistake.\""]
["14:00,540","14:03,060","\"I figure that he's probably trying to be like,\""]
["14:03,060","14:05,060","\"Oh, my position shifted.\""]
["14:05,060","14:07,780","\"So like the P-stream changed this angle,\""]
["14:07,780","14:10,660","\"but like his body doesn't move when it happens.\""]
["14:10,660","14:12,660","\"It just starts going upwards.\""]
["14:12,660","14:16,440","\"Stroke my face.\""]
["14:16,440","14:20,260","\"Well, do you wanna do a cover of that song, Chris?\""]
["14:20,260","14:21,260","\"Not really, okay.\""]
["14:21,260","14:22,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["14:22,100","14:23,740","\"(humming)\""]
["14:23,740","14:27,220","\"Now, Julian, should I get rid of poison sting for Blizzard?\""]
["14:27,220","14:28,220","\"Yeah, absolutely.\""]
["14:28,220","14:29,460","\"Poison sting ain't worth shit.\""]
["14:29,460","14:30,340","\"No, it isn't.\""]
["14:30,340","14:32,260","\"That's why I was doing it.\""]
["14:32,260","14:34,620","\"You ready to have Blizzard on Lil' Stank?\""]
["14:34,620","14:35,700","\"- Yeah.\""]
["14:35,700","14:37,540","\"- Chris, freezing is really fun in this game\""]
["14:37,540","14:39,020","\"because it's completely broken.\""]
["14:39,020","14:39,860","\"- Oh yeah, that's it.\""]
["14:39,860","14:42,700","\"- If an enemy is frozen, they're just frozen permanently.\""]
["14:42,700","14:44,660","\"So in tournaments, they actually had to ban you\""]
["14:44,660","14:46,740","\"from using freezing at all.\""]
["14:46,740","14:48,420","\"And then when Pokemon Stadium came out,\""]
["14:48,420","14:50,380","\"they changed how it worked for that.\""]
["14:50,380","14:51,580","\"So it was a broken aim war.\""]
["14:51,580","14:53,780","\"- So in like, when we were all in school,\""]
["14:53,780","14:56,660","\"if someone used freeze on their friends' Pokemon,\""]
["14:56,660","14:57,580","\"they can't fight back.\""]
["14:57,580","14:58,480","\"- No.\""]
["14:58,480","15:00,380","\"Unless you burn them right after,\""]
["15:00,380","15:04,180","\"Which that's your only fault for doing that also you not never gonna happen yeah\""]
["15:04,180","15:09,900","\"Probably not because you're not gonna switch out you want to teach Gary's mod solar beam or no\""]
["15:09,900","15:17,060","\"I don't know if he's got room for it. He does. I just don't know if you really want to opt for that because that's one\""]
["15:17,060","15:21,220","\"We have to it's a two-turn thing. Yeah, exactly. I don't want to do it because it's two turns oh\""]
["15:21,220","15:24,420","\"Well\""]
["15:26,460","15:28,460","\"Aww look at little ash.\""]
["15:28,460","15:29,460","\"And there's the key.\""]
["15:29,460","15:31,460","\"And you know what we do now?\""]
["15:31,460","15:33,460","\"We escape!\""]
["15:33,460","15:34,460","\"Ooooo!\""]
["15:34,460","15:35,460","\"Escape!\""]
