["00:05,000","00:07,000","\"Let's play more, dude.\""]
["00:07,000","00:08,000","\"I like this game.\""]
["00:08,000","00:09,000","\"I wanna be Sephiroth again.\""]
["00:09,000","00:14,000","\"This game makes my nipples hard and other parts of my body very soft.\""]
["00:14,000","00:19,000","\"I think New Super Mario Bros. is definitely the least bland art-steldit overhead.\""]
["00:19,000","00:21,000","\"I like all the music, cause I'm so-\""]
["00:21,000","00:22,000","\"*laughs*\""]
["00:22,000","00:24,000","\"You didn't mean that at all.\""]
["00:24,000","00:27,000","\"That was really weird how, in that game,\""]
["00:27,000","00:31,120","\"They made the characters kind of Mickey Mouse and like bounce up and down. Yeah\""]
["00:31,120","00:34,520","\"It was kind of a new cool cute thing at the time\""]
["00:34,520","00:39,960","\"It's still it's still charming. That's the only charming thing about that game. Get peeved me. Oh, I\""]
["00:39,960","00:44,660","\"Really pissed you off. I actually liked it. The little enemies that are trying to kill you are also dancing to the beat\""]
["00:44,660","00:50,500","\"Yeah, it is kind of breaking the lore. I guess you wanna get a sonic a try. I like when I play Mario\""]
["00:50,500","00:52,500","\"I like to imagine a man\""]
["00:52,500","00:55,940","\"Sonic was another one where they wouldn't let them butts with the model at all, huh?\""]
["00:55,940","01:02,420","\"Yeah, he's like Pac-Man. He's yeah various shades of blue. You know Pac-Man's is really really embarrassing\""]
["01:02,420","01:09,060","\"Pac-Man's yeah, I could have gotten a sonic adventure model in there. They could have gotten the like\""]
["01:09,060","01:13,780","\"That is the sonic adventure model. Is it? Oh, you mean adventure one?\""]
["01:13,780","01:19,220","\"I'm surprised they didn't do like shadows an echo fighter. All they really had to do was change the run cycle\""]
["01:19,300","01:22,100","\"I think he's a trophy or something, right? Or a spirit?\""]
["01:22,100","01:23,860","\"He might be. I'm not sure.\""]
["01:23,860","01:28,420","\"I don't know how to actually get kills with Sonic.\""]
["01:28,420","01:28,980","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["01:28,980","01:31,220","\"Other than just actual smash attacks.\""]
["01:31,220","01:34,020","\"I can't really help you there. I actually don't know.\""]
["01:34,020","01:36,820","\"I think Sonic is one of those characters where if you want to be good with him,\""]
["01:36,820","01:39,220","\"you have to kind of jump off the stage after people.\""]
["01:39,220","01:43,620","\"He's just like death by attrition and like very high agility.\""]
["01:43,620","01:47,380","\"He's definitely not like a good like noob character.\""]
["01:48,260","01:51,860","\"Also, I've fucking lost that first life in like 10 seconds.\""]

["01:52,900","01:56,180","\"I don't know, I just got like unfortunate placement, I guess.\""]

["02:56,540","02:58,980","\"And her picture was like a hop blonde model\""]
["02:58,980","03:06,060","\"But then when the girl came to his house she was like this weird brunette wearing a bomber jacket and her hair was all messy\""]
["03:06,060","03:12,540","\"And she looked homeless and she wouldn't talk to him and it gave her a big bag of spicy Doritos\""]
["03:12,540","03:15,040","\"And then he sent me a video of her\""]
["03:15,040","03:17,040","\"\"\"This is fucking storm!\"\"\""]
["03:17,040","03:22,640","\"It is weird, he sent me a video of her eating out of the Doritos bag like a horse where she had it like up to her face\""]
["03:22,640","03:27,600","\"And her hands are all covered in the Doritos like the guy from Toy Story 2\""]
["03:27,600","03:30,920","\"And she's getting it all over his like white expensive couch\""]
["03:30,920","03:38,540","\"And in the video he's kicking at her. He's kicking at her. He's like okay time to go come on time to go and she's not responding\""]

["05:09,620","05:15,800","\"The turnbuckle is literally just the term for the corner pieces. I thought turnbuckle was the guy who owns Garfield\""]
["05:15,800","05:18,340","\"John our buck\""]
