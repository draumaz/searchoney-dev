["01:16,120","01:18,120","\"It looks like a rip off of a excite bike.\""]
["01:18,120","01:19,120","\"Yeah, it works for me.\""]
["01:19,120","01:21,120","\"Yeah, it might even be better than an excite bike.\""]
["01:21,120","01:22,120","\"Mortomania...\""]
["01:22,120","01:24,120","\"I'm not, we're not using color.\""]

["01:46,120","01:47,120","\"Okay.\""]
["01:47,120","01:49,120","\"Well, that looks like a Mario Kart rip-off.\""]
["01:49,120","01:50,120","\"Mummy.\""]
["01:50,120","01:53,120","\"This came out way before Mario Kart.\""]
["01:53,120","01:54,120","\"I did it though.\""]
["01:54,120","01:55,120","\"Yeah, definitely.\""]

["02:05,560","02:08,540","\"Black cock\""]
["02:08,540","02:16,220","\"Because BC yeah, they should have thought that one more. I should add another B to make him more impressive\""]
["02:16,220","02:24,160","\"BC racers British Columbian racers. I guess it's like before Christ racers hell yeah\""]
["02:24,160","02:31,980","\"Oh, this is Nito. It's got good animations. Look at all these cool cavemen. I don't think the audio works right in this game or maybe they're just\""]
["02:31,980","02:35,020","\"Check out that Chad and his name\""]
["02:35,020","02:43,960","\"You've a been no scumbag. I thought that was a sound effect in the game for a second. It was sound definitely isn't working\""]
["02:43,960","02:46,320","\"Nothing will\""]
["02:46,320","02:51,060","\"Maybe it's a mouse mouse. Try the mouse. It's definitely the mouse. No, it's not the map. Oh, oh\""]
["02:51,960","02:55,880","\"- Puches, thanks for punch. - Damn, your queen throws fist bruh.\""]

["03:10,860","03:12,460","\"- No, it was fun.\""]
["03:12,460","03:14,280","\"I could've been, but it's super wacky.\""]
["03:14,280","03:15,120","\"What was it called?\""]
["03:15,120","03:15,940","\"You go down?\""]

["03:16,780","03:17,620","\"- Yo wacky wheels.\""]
["03:17,620","03:18,620","\"- Wacky wheels.\""]
["03:18,620","03:20,600","\"- These all look like Mario Kart clones.\""]
["03:20,600","03:28,140","\"Love wacky fellas seems like a rip off of Mario Kart animals in place of the familiar Mario characters\""]
["03:28,140","03:35,080","\"Really well, it's a racing game where you choose character and race go-karts around the track\""]
["03:35,080","03:40,100","\"Supposedly the end of the game was created to try to recreate Mario Kart on PC\""]
["03:40,100","03:44,500","\"Wacky wheels and self features fairly good VGA graphics and sound effects\""]
["03:44,500","03:50,820","\"But the frame rate is quite low and can be can appear choppy it can be fun, but Mario Kart is still better\""]
["03:50,820","03:53,900","\"Be fun\""]
["03:53,900","03:59,860","\"Adam this one's for you, baby. We can buy the full version you want if it works out for pins. Oh, that's fire\""]

["04:05,040","04:09,540","\"Wow, so this game was made by a big brain motherfucker\""]
["04:09,540","04:12,660","\"Beavis soft. I\""]
["04:12,900","04:17,060","\"I wanna, I wanna. I had a weird Mario Kart rip off on Sega Genesis.\""]
["04:17,060","04:23,460","\"Forget what it was called. It's all the animals. It's too late. I don't know. I think it's gonna be\""]
["04:23,460","04:28,740","\"hard enough to figure out how to do one player race with the keyboard. What do you mean? There's\""]
["04:28,740","04:35,140","\"only like 200 of me. Yeah, they're trying to get you to buy the shareware version or to buy the,\""]
["04:35,140","04:42,100","\"like a registration code. Oh really? Six laps. Unlock all the extra characters. Jesus.\""]
["04:42,100","04:44,700","\"This is not as good as cow war.\""]
["04:44,700","04:46,860","\"- Ah, that's who that's a cow war.\""]
["04:46,860","04:48,220","\"- Fuck this game, just socks.\""]
["04:48,220","04:49,060","\"- Go back to cow war.\""]
["04:49,060","04:52,140","\"- They're just locking you out of everything.\""]
["04:52,140","04:53,980","\"- No, we will do a classic--\""]
["04:53,980","04:56,020","\"- A classic arcade type game.\""]
["04:56,020","04:57,580","\"- What about educational--\""]
["04:57,580","05:01,340","\"- Wait, game creation systems, do they have ZZT?\""]
["05:01,340","05:02,580","\"Fucking loves ZZT.\""]
["05:02,580","05:03,420","\"- What's ZZT?\""]
["05:03,420","05:04,260","\"- It's pretty low.\""]
["05:04,260","05:05,900","\"- They're super ZZ, hold on.\""]
["05:05,900","05:07,620","\"Super ZZT's going a little fast.\""]
["05:07,620","05:09,900","\"They have original ZZs, well they have mega zooks.\""]
["05:09,900","05:10,740","\"- What's that, what's that?\""]
["05:10,740","05:12,540","\"- The amazing, so later version of ZZT\""]
["05:12,540","05:14,300","\"that supported MOD music.\""]
["05:14,300","05:15,940","\"I love the built in here.\""]
["05:15,940","05:17,580","\"Yeah, run Mega Zukes.\""]
["05:17,580","05:18,580","\"- So far as excited.\""]
["05:18,580","05:20,580","\"- Yeah, feels great.\""]
["05:20,580","05:22,460","\"- I remember, I thought the music in this game\""]
["05:22,460","05:23,780","\"was amazing when it came out.\""]
["05:23,780","05:25,100","\"- What is this game?\""]
["05:25,100","05:28,820","\"- Just do like Sound Blaster Pro or Sound Blaster 16E.\""]
["05:28,820","05:29,660","\"- E?\""]
["05:29,660","05:30,500","\"- E.\""]
["05:30,500","05:31,340","\"- There we go, there we go.\""]
["05:31,340","05:32,500","\"Welcome to Mega Zukes.\""]
["05:32,500","05:34,740","\"Use the arrow keys to scroll all of this text\""]
["05:34,740","05:36,420","\"and escape when you're done reading.\""]
["05:36,420","05:38,460","\"- This is based on ZZT, which was,\""]
["05:38,460","05:42,160","\"I think one of Cliffy B's first games.\""]
["05:42,160","05:43,000","\"- Are you serious?\""]
["05:43,000","05:45,760","\"We should read controls to see what--\""]
["05:45,760","05:47,880","\"- We can print Gregory's games.\""]
["05:47,880","05:51,120","\"- See, it's got sample based music.\""]
["05:51,120","05:52,400","\"- This is blowing my mind.\""]
["05:52,400","05:55,920","\"- The Caverns of Zooks.\""]
["05:55,920","05:57,800","\"- So this is a game made in this software?\""]
["05:57,800","05:58,720","\"- Yeah.\""]
["05:58,720","06:00,360","\"So it's got a full editor,\""]
["06:00,360","06:02,200","\"but it's got a built in store,\""]
["06:02,200","06:05,520","\"like a game built in to introduce you to it.\""]
["06:05,520","06:06,800","\"- Wow.\""]
["06:06,800","06:09,000","\"It's all ASCII graphics also.\""]

["06:10,600","06:12,760","\"- Wow, what is that thing?\""]

["06:18,240","06:19,720","\"- Dude, this is like noita.\""]
["06:19,720","06:22,320","\"- Yeah, suddenly the staff shoots out numerous\""]
["06:22,320","06:23,200","\"bright beams of light.\""]
["06:23,200","06:25,680","\"The tunnel caves in trapping you within the labyrinth.\""]
["06:25,680","06:29,760","\"I used to spend entire days trying to make games in this\""]

["06:32,080","06:35,720","\"- Turminofence, but this sucks my ass.\""]

["06:39,280","06:40,480","\"I thought it's top down.\""]
["06:40,480","06:41,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:41,480","06:42,480","\"Oh, those bears will kill you.\""]
["06:42,480","06:43,480","\"I think space bar shoots.\""]
["06:43,480","06:45,880","\"Oh, I thought they were like Shrek.\""]
["06:45,880","06:46,880","\"Or how do you shoot?\""]
["06:46,880","06:47,880","\"I forget.\""]
["06:47,880","06:48,880","\"You know, no.\""]
["06:48,880","06:50,520","\"We probably should have read the help.\""]
["06:50,520","06:51,520","\"That's what I said.\""]
["06:51,520","06:52,520","\"Oh, man.\""]

["07:18,800","07:22,240","\"You got to admit, this is bopping the little song.\""]
["07:22,240","07:23,240","\"The song's good.\""]
["07:23,240","07:25,600","\"I don't really know what the fuck's happening on the screen though.\""]

["07:53,840","07:56,280","\"But I didn't actually kill you. I guess I'm invincible\""]
["07:56,280","08:01,220","\"This reminds me of that cat mouse game. Can I show it to you? This is a pack sure\""]
["08:03,320","08:06,920","\"Uh, you weren't ready for the brilliance of mega zooks.\""]
["08:06,920","08:11,680","\"Yeah, yeah, kind of lacking in brain power there.\""]
