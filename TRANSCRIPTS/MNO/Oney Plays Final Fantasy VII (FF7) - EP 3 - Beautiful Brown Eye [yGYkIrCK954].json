["04:22,620","04:25,620","\"But, Petrus, are you feeling alright?\""]
["04:25,620","04:28,620","\"Yeah. Why?\""]
["04:28,620","04:32,620","\"No reason. You just look a little tired, I guess.\""]

["04:47,620","04:49,620","\"Today, the number one reactor was bombed.\""]
["04:49,620","04:53,620","\"The terrorist group Avalanche has claimed responsibility\""]
["04:53,620","04:56,620","\"and is expected that Avalanche will continue its reign of terror.\""]
["04:56,620","04:59,620","\"But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear.\""]
["04:59,620","05:04,620","\"I have immediately mobilized Soldier to protect our citizenry against the senseless violence.\""]

["05:41,580","05:43,580","\"Probably all them guys and soldier are.\""]
["05:43,580","05:46,580","\"But don't forget that your skinny ass working for average.\""]
["05:46,580","05:50,580","\"Don't get no ideas about hanging on the Shinra.\""]

["06:12,580","06:15,580","\"Brown-eye, let him go.\""]
["06:15,580","06:18,580","\"Looks like he still misses the Shinra.\""]
["06:18,580","06:20,580","\"Shut up.\""]
["06:20,580","06:23,580","\"I don't care about neither Shinra nor Soldier.\""]
["06:23,580","06:26,580","\"A bunch of losers.\""]
["06:26,580","06:30,580","\"I don't care about Avalanche or the planet either.\""]

["07:12,660","07:30,180","\"Sorry. Sorry, Brown Eye. The planet is dying slowly but surely it's dying you fucking asshole. So what has to do something? I don't know. Let Blackman and his buddies do something about it. It's got nothing to do with me.\""]
["07:30,180","07:37,180","\"So you're really leaving. You're just gonna walk right out ignoring your childhood friend.\""]
