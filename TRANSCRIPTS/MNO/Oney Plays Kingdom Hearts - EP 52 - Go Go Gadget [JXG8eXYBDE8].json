["03:29,700","03:33,500","\"It's just kind of a light blue or dark blue well\""]
["03:33,500","03:38,260","\"It looks like it looks like it would be nice to run your fingers across it like it looks like it has like a slight\""]
["03:38,260","03:43,860","\"Kind of like a not-felty, but it looks like it's made of rubber. It's like Matt\""]
["03:43,860","03:52,440","\"Not as in Matt Watson as in a matte texture looks like it would be very dry to touch dry to touch huh?\""]
["03:52,440","03:58,720","\"That gives me an idea. What if we suck all the moisture out of the world?\""]
["03:58,720","04:07,900","\"That's a premise for a movie that's so fucking dumb\""]
["04:07,900","04:12,640","\"Why do you say it like that cuz it is?\""]
["04:12,640","04:23,860","\"is. We must remove all moisture from the multiverse. Go go gadget big scary monster.\""]
["04:23,860","04:31,420","\"Big cock. Why did he use these? Use these. Uncle gadget. I'm scared of monsters.\""]

["04:44,940","04:49,260","\">> I'm just does it. He just does it with his hands.\""]

["04:59,620","05:05,860","\">> Christ. There you go, Chris. I learned super blind.\""]
["05:05,860","05:08,080","\"Go go gadget, you're blind forever.\""]
["05:08,080","05:11,400","\"No!\""]
["05:11,400","05:14,180","\"Go go gadget, your memories are all fake.\""]
["05:14,180","05:18,580","\"Go go gadget, I'm not real.\""]
["05:18,580","05:20,340","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:20,340","05:21,180","\"Is he real?\""]
["05:21,180","05:28,220","\"Go go gadget, all mountains on earth are gone now.\""]
["05:28,220","05:32,980","\"All the surface of the earth is inverted.\""]
["05:34,260","05:37,780","\"Go go gadget, the color black everywhere is now white.\""]
["05:37,780","05:44,060","\"Go go gadget, a foul stench fills the air.\""]
["05:44,060","05:46,140","\"Go go gadget, I am your mother.\""]
["05:46,140","05:46,980","\"(laughs)\""]
["05:46,980","05:47,980","\"No!\""]
["05:47,980","05:50,100","\"What happened to the original mother then?\""]
["05:50,100","05:51,220","\"- I really like this room.\""]
["05:51,220","05:52,980","\"This is probably my favorite room in the game.\""]
["05:52,980","05:54,440","\"- It's pretty good.\""]
["05:54,440","05:57,140","\"Yeah, it's all textured very nicely.\""]
["05:57,140","05:58,040","\"That looks great.\""]
["05:58,040","06:01,420","\"- What do you think it is?\""]
["06:01,420","06:03,100","\"I have never pieced together\""]
["06:03,100","06:05,100","\"But this place is supposed to be.\""]
["06:05,100","06:08,340","\"It's all the memories of childhood.\""]
["06:08,340","06:09,180","\"Oh.\""]
["06:09,180","06:11,820","\"- Is this chain of memories?\""]
["06:11,820","06:13,980","\"- Is this real or not real at all?\""]
["06:13,980","06:14,820","\"- No.\""]
["06:14,820","06:17,660","\"- What happened to these weird dreams?\""]
["06:17,660","06:19,900","\"- Is this real or stupid?\""]
["06:19,900","06:22,180","\"- My teeth are falling out of them.\""]
["06:22,180","06:23,060","\"- Go, go gadget.\""]
["06:23,060","06:24,200","\"I like your teeth.\""]
["06:24,200","06:28,020","\"- Why do you have them?\""]
["06:28,020","06:30,500","\"- Why is that a thing he has to use?\""]
["06:30,500","06:31,820","\"He just feels that way.\""]
["06:31,820","06:33,820","\"It makes your teeth get...\""]
["06:33,820","06:36,380","\"He has to call it out in order to have an emotion.\""]
["06:36,380","06:38,940","\"Gogo gadget, compassion for fellow man.\""]
["06:38,940","06:41,820","\"It changes your teeth to exactly what he prefers.\""]
["06:41,820","06:46,380","\"Why have you created this monstrosity?\""]
["06:46,380","06:47,380","\"Hey, uh, Deek.\""]
["06:47,380","06:49,380","\"Sorry, wait, you're cookie jar now.\""]
["06:49,380","06:51,820","\"Can you give us the right to inspect your gadget?\""]
["06:51,820","06:52,820","\"We have some ideas.\""]
["06:52,820","06:53,820","\"Ooh.\""]
["06:53,820","06:57,300","\"That'd be quite happy if they actually did.\""]
["06:57,300","06:58,300","\"I would be.\""]
["06:58,300","07:00,900","\"I really love Inspector Gadget as a concept.\""]
["07:00,900","07:02,300","\"That is what I've always said.\""]
["07:02,300","07:04,100","\"I love it as a concept.\""]
["07:04,100","07:07,300","\"There is so much there that has so much potential\""]
["07:07,300","07:09,180","\"and then the show itself is just kind of boring.\""]
["07:09,180","07:10,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:10,660","07:15,020","\"Do you think anybody, or do we have any viewers watching this\""]
["07:15,020","07:17,500","\"that actually like the old inspector gadgets?\""]
["07:17,500","07:20,280","\"Is that even possible?\""]
["07:20,280","07:26,740","\"- Like I said, everything there, I think is very easy.\""]
["07:26,740","07:28,220","\"- No, they have all the pieces.\""]
["07:28,220","07:29,140","\"It's just never put in-\""]
["07:29,140","07:30,300","\"- It's not even animated poorly.\""]
["07:30,300","07:34,800","\"Yeah, cuz it's Japanese. Yeah, they outsourced it to Japanese studio. So it even looks nice\""]
["07:34,800","07:39,100","\"It really just is the writing. What's this green chamber?\""]
["07:39,100","07:41,900","\"This is my room\""]
["07:41,900","07:44,860","\"That's phallic it sure is\""]
["07:44,860","07:48,420","\"My testicles rotten\""]
["07:48,420","07:53,140","\"These guys really just remind me of the do monsters\""]
["07:53,140","07:58,140","\"Because it's a head it is it they just look really similar to me\""]
["07:58,140","08:07,020","\"I remember Doom 3 was my most fucking scary game ever for a long time.\""]
["08:07,020","08:09,180","\"I was too scared to beat it.\""]
["08:09,180","08:10,180","\"Really?\""]
["08:10,180","08:11,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:11,180","08:13,940","\"Well, it's just jump scares.\""]
["08:13,940","08:15,380","\"But that game is only jump scares.\""]
["08:15,380","08:17,780","\"I don't understand the direction for that one.\""]
["08:17,780","08:20,300","\"It was weird that they opted for that.\""]
["08:20,300","08:21,300","\"I can use the OI.\""]
["08:21,300","08:25,020","\"Because when Doom 3 came out, I remember a lot of people then started saying, \"\"Do\""]
["08:25,020","08:26,820","\"one and two are really scary.\"\"\""]
["08:26,820","08:32,340","\"Nothing weren't they never were what are you talking about people who grew up with any s and stuff or like\""]
["08:32,340","08:35,380","\"Castlevania is one of the scariest games. I played as a kid\""]
["08:35,380","08:39,020","\"I have you heard people say that because that that would be baffling to me\""]
["08:39,020","08:44,180","\"Yeah, no people say it maybe you hype it up in your own head and you're like this is usually though in games\""]
["08:44,180","08:50,420","\"I guess I'm if I'm armed with a weapon. Yeah, well, that's the thing to me is that like anytime that you can physically harm\""]
["08:50,940","08:57,740","\"The threat like it ceases to become threatening to me even even stuff like Silent Hill doesn't really work for me in that regard\""]
["08:57,740","09:04,380","\"So I can't play Silent Hill. It's too scary. You're carrying around a gun and a big heavy pipe. What about Loud Hill?\""]
["09:04,380","09:07,060","\"That was pretty good\""]
["09:07,060","09:13,940","\"Ambient noise Hill was Silent Hill your favorite song from DDR no\""]
["09:13,940","09:18,700","\"Do you remember that song? I do remember it's just a Christmas song here\""]
["09:19,260","09:26,320","\"Do you ding dong are you familiar with the the version of the original theme song that has like vocals over it?\""]
["09:26,320","09:29,300","\"For what silent for silent Hill?\""]
["09:29,300","09:33,900","\"Because I every time I talk to somebody about that they don't know what I'm talking about\""]
["09:33,900","09:37,800","\"You know what we're talking about like a guy with a really goofy voice\""]
["09:37,800","09:43,520","\"Like the goofy yeah, we're we were listening to it earlier\""]
["09:45,220","09:49,120","\"Biohazard or Resident Evil 1 had some really goofy...\""]
["09:49,120","09:50,120","\"So that's a no.\""]
["09:50,120","09:52,420","\"Uh, I... I...\""]
["09:52,420","09:54,720","\"Maybe I've heard it at one point, I don't know.\""]
["09:54,720","09:58,520","\"'Cause I... these things also drift away from me a lot.\""]
["09:58,520","10:01,220","\"I had to remind myself of that with Resident Evil.\""]
["10:01,220","10:04,720","\"Resident Evil 1 in Japan had very goofy...\""]
["10:04,720","10:08,720","\"- I had this like really cheerful sounding Japanese. - Yeah.\""]
["10:08,720","10:13,920","\"And I kind of... I kind of love it a lot, even though it's really unfitting.\""]
["10:13,920","10:16,820","\"It gives it a certain tone to it that\""]
["10:16,820","10:23,120","\"It capitalizes on all the goofy elements in the original that I really enjoy\""]
["10:23,120","10:28,320","\"I probably should have chosen hard mode on this. I've had a really easy time on hard mode\""]
["10:28,320","10:32,500","\"They're also expecting you to get more out of the combat even though it's really limited in this game\""]
["10:32,500","10:40,280","\"It's not limited. It's perfect. You've got big boots big pants boots. You've got a chain\""]
["10:40,620","10:45,900","\"You've got a membrane and you can take it all over town\""]
["10:45,900","10:50,100","\"They added a lot more to the combat than the other games fuck off why?\""]
["10:50,100","10:55,640","\"Cuz fuck you why this case you're gonna get to see when we play chain of\""]
["10:55,640","10:57,900","\"Scam's perfect! Zora!\""]
["10:57,900","10:58,560","\"Zora!\""]
["10:58,560","11:00,060","\"Zora!\""]

["11:14,280","11:16,820","\"Sora Tude\""]
["11:16,820","11:21,000","\"Sora Aurora Pemberton. What if his name was Sory yellow shoe?\""]
["11:21,000","11:23,640","\"Gonna die. I\""]
["11:23,640","11:27,780","\"Am I am I am gonna that was her name\""]
["11:27,780","11:31,760","\"Her second name is died. You know what Kyrie's last name is\""]
["11:31,760","11:35,420","\"Darkness\""]
["11:36,300","11:43,020","\"Really? It's foreshadowing. No, her second name is Light, Love's Riku.\""]
["11:43,020","11:49,340","\"Is everybody's name just a description? Her real name is sitting in a tree.\""]
["11:49,340","11:56,140","\"E-I-S-S-I-N-G. Why can't a bird suddenly appear? Fuck off!\""]
["11:56,140","12:00,540","\"I'm trying to have a serious discussion about Kyrie's feet and you cut me off.\""]

["12:18,220","12:20,940","\"That just came over to say hi\""]
["12:20,940","12:31,020","\"Don't sing it like that. Why I am I can't do it. I am fine with a sultry rap boy genius who did fireflies?\""]
["12:31,020","12:35,020","\"You will not believe your own.\""]
["12:35,020","12:38,020","\"That's what it was sounding like as if they did a cover of Rap Boy Genius.\""]
["12:38,020","12:39,020","\"They wouldn't.\""]
["12:39,020","12:46,020","\"The planet earth turns too quickly.\""]
