["02:03,640","02:10,160","\"Because it's blue this is really good writing\""]
["02:10,160","02:17,600","\"We figured if the character says what they're feeling then you won't know how they feel\""]
["02:18,520","02:22,080","\"You know I am said don't worry. I am happy\""]
["02:22,080","02:31,760","\"We're going to the green dimension\""]

["02:53,680","03:01,400","\"Yeah. She's really mysterious. I am scary, but the background isn't, so I feel out of\""]

["03:19,720","03:23,920","\"The big man the stupid castle\""]
["03:23,920","03:32,080","\"Famous for being stupid. Who made the baby castle? I'm not a child\""]
["03:32,080","03:38,760","\"I didn't want to stop here. Oh no, another train's gone too\""]
["03:38,760","03:40,760","\"There goes our ride.\""]
["03:40,760","03:43,760","\"Uh oh, we might starve.\""]
["03:43,760","03:46,760","\"I guess I'll have to eat the duck.\""]
["03:46,760","03:48,760","\"There's plenty of trees to eat.\""]
["03:48,760","03:50,760","\"No, the duck.\""]
["03:50,760","03:53,760","\"Oh, Pete. I love Pete.\""]
["03:53,760","03:56,760","\"He sounds funny. He has your favorite thing about him.\""]
["03:56,760","04:00,760","\"He holds his belly and goes, \"\"Oh, he sure does.\"\"\""]
["04:00,760","04:05,760","\"I love that he always has diarrhea.\""]
["04:05,760","04:07,760","\"This is character trait.\""]
["04:07,760","04:12,340","\"He's always holding his hands up to his butthole. Here's Jim coming again\""]
["04:12,340","04:16,600","\"Do it\""]
["04:16,600","04:23,100","\"I\""]
["04:23,100","04:40,860","\"Where did Pete get his anime suit?\""]
["04:40,860","04:45,220","\"He comes to see him on Twitter.\""]
["04:45,220","04:50,060","\"That's probably not likely.\""]
["04:50,060","04:53,060","\"I imagine Peach's lives in this really depressing apartment.\""]
["04:53,060","04:56,060","\"This is a bunch of anime posters on the wall.\""]
["04:56,060","04:59,060","\"That seems accurate to his character.\""]
["04:59,060","05:00,060","\"He's got cool shoes.\""]
["05:00,060","05:02,060","\"He duct taped his own keyblade together.\""]
["05:02,060","05:05,060","\"How is he supposed to reach the zipper back there?\""]
["05:05,060","05:08,060","\"He has to reach all the way under him.\""]
["05:08,060","05:11,060","\"That's all around the other side.\""]
["05:18,060","05:21,500","\"Whoa tickle feet Pete. I hate you\""]
["05:21,500","05:24,820","\"We sure do\""]
["05:24,820","05:26,820","\"Because in trouble for ages\""]
["05:26,820","05:32,860","\"His majesty banished him to another dimensional you could just say look he's shaking with rage\""]
["05:32,860","05:36,020","\"Don't have to sing much else\""]
["05:36,020","05:41,060","\"I'm banishing him to another dimension\""]
["05:41,060","05:46,280","\"I was a little bit into the shadow room a little bit interested in that what happened\""]
["05:46,460","05:50,740","\"Pete was kicking over buckets of water, so we sent him to the nightmare dimension\""]
["05:50,740","05:59,540","\"I'm not sure of all the water. I can't do a piece. I'm literally defending myself at this point\""]
["05:59,540","06:04,820","\"She's toast. Huh?\""]
["06:04,820","06:06,820","\"We killed her\""]
["06:06,820","06:10,220","\"You next\""]
["06:10,220","06:15,100","\"You murdered my friend\""]
["06:15,100","06:17,820","\"That was better. Well, we might have done it\""]
["06:17,820","06:22,740","\"Heartless squad round up\""]
["06:22,740","06:31,040","\"Oh this music was used in the Kingdom Hearts 3 trailers with Toy Story remember I do\""]
["06:31,040","06:37,220","\"Remember they fought the anime doll. Did you upload a reaction video Chris? I did\""]
["06:37,220","06:42,640","\"How did it go remove though? Huh cuz those people walking around naked in the background\""]
["06:42,640","06:49,640","\"Then your first reaction was to yell the N word as bad as possible.\""]
["06:49,640","06:51,640","\"Why did I do that?\""]
["06:51,640","06:52,640","\"I don't know.\""]
["06:52,640","06:53,640","\"Yeah, you tell me.\""]
["06:53,640","06:55,640","\"What did you see in the trailer that did that?\""]
["06:55,640","06:56,640","\"He almost wake.\""]
["06:56,640","06:57,640","\"Oh no.\""]
["06:57,640","07:01,640","\"Because clearly you didn't do that on your own and it was the game's fault that you said that.\""]
["07:01,640","07:04,640","\"It sure as hell had nothing to do with black people because there's only white people in these games.\""]
["07:04,640","07:05,640","\"That's true.\""]
["07:05,640","07:06,640","\"I was thinking about that earlier.\""]
["07:06,640","07:09,640","\"I was trying to remember if there's any black characters in it.\""]
["07:09,640","07:16,640","\"in it. We need more representation in Kingdom Hearts.\""]
["07:16,640","07:26,040","\"Master, you should pour oil on Donald. And then what? Then he will be the POC of the\""]
["07:26,040","07:35,280","\"game. I just pictured like vegetable oil. Not even hot. Not even a hog oil. No, I met\""]
["07:35,280","07:39,680","\"Like when there's an oil spill and you see a bunch of ducks. I see what you do in here\""]
["07:39,680","07:44,560","\"Like in say by the bell when he says a lot oil dog. I remember that one. He said this ducks good\""]
["07:44,560","07:52,520","\"Does Morris quit dipping ducks in oil? Okay, sorry\""]
["07:52,520","07:57,520","\"He didn't dip the duck he was trying to save the duck\""]
["07:57,520","08:04,280","\"By the Bell reunion on Jimmy camel or Fallon I forget they're both the same person\""]
["08:04,280","08:08,200","\"Yeah, but they did a reunion and the only person that didn't get back was\""]
["08:08,200","08:12,680","\"Yeah, because he isn't he in jail or something is he I just know that no one likes him\""]
["08:12,680","08:15,800","\"He's kind of a creep\""]
["08:15,800","08:22,660","\"Are you gonna make up rumors about him? Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it. Okay screech said hi to me\""]
["08:22,660","08:25,560","\"Yeah, and I started falling down to my knees\""]
["08:25,560","08:31,160","\"He hesitates at red lights sometimes because he wants to check ahead just in case\""]
["08:33,240","08:36,600","\"But every single person that was there on the show all looks great\""]
["08:36,600","08:39,980","\"They did they barely look different from how they used to look\""]
["08:39,980","08:43,760","\"Especially fucking aces later. He doesn't look like he aged at all\""]
["08:43,760","08:49,040","\"It's almost like they went back in time. They want cocking so down\""]
["08:49,040","08:54,880","\"Drastically different was the principal. He looks like he's about to die. Jeez\""]
["08:54,880","09:00,400","\"Are they are they slowly killing him? Yeah, they're sucking the heartless out of him\""]
["09:00,840","09:05,480","\"What would you how what if the rest of the cast was living off of his life forces?\""]
["09:05,480","09:12,600","\"They probably are what if you were watching this bit play out and then suddenly Kingdom Hearts music started up in the bag and heartless appeared\""]
["09:12,600","09:19,400","\"They all pulled out key blades that's so funny for a bit if they started gorily hacking them the pieces\""]
["09:19,400","09:21,400","\"I'd be like whoa what's happening?\""]
["09:21,400","09:26,800","\"This is cool after the fight no one talks about they put the weapons away and they go back to the\""]
["09:28,280","09:34,960","\"I would love that that would be very strange and surreal. They're the keyblade warriors, but they still have to do their job every day\""]
["09:34,960","09:37,800","\"That would be really cool to see\""]
["09:37,800","09:45,960","\"No, it wouldn't. Would it be cool to see like North Korea nuking America and then Donald Trump pulls out a keyblade\""]
["09:45,960","09:47,960","\"It starts fighting the nukes in the air\""]
["09:47,960","09:52,520","\"These laces in and half. It would be one of those reaction time commands that you'd have to do\""]
["09:52,520","09:57,880","\"Do you think people would get mad at Donald Trump for defending the country in such a silly manner?\""]
["09:57,880","10:03,540","\"No, they'd be fine if he blew up every nuke in the sky and saved us all with a keyblade\""]
["10:03,540","10:07,400","\"You think everyone would forgive him. I would forgive him for all of his past sins. Yeah\""]
["10:07,400","10:12,680","\"That's awesome. That's his redemption arc. He's the anti-hero of the game\""]
["10:12,680","10:19,660","\"Donald just please cover his assholes pissing me off\""]
["10:19,660","10:27,600","\"So the world's aren't at peace after all so nothing that's happening means anything\""]
["10:27,600","10:35,840","\"Really? I don't even exist. I'm a video game. I have no DNA. I\""]
["10:35,840","10:41,860","\"Like the idea that that's what he's concerned about. It starts falling apart\""]
["10:41,860","10:52,600","\"Did you see the picture of the guy who got irradiated so bad that his DNA was just destroyed completely and his skin started falling off and\""]
["10:52,600","10:55,160","\"I feel like I heard about that. It's a scary picture\""]
["10:55,160","11:04,120","\"Is he okay? No, he's dead. Oh, they kept him alive for like 80 days doing experiments on him\""]
["11:04,120","11:08,120","\"And then they did that\""]
["11:08,120","11:13,480","\"Is he a Disney character, what was he in?\""]
["11:13,480","11:19,920","\"Was he? No, it's from Mulan. I've never seen fantasia. Oh, that's a good one. I like it\""]
["11:19,920","11:22,440","\"He's the wizard that appears halfway through Mulan. I\""]
["11:23,360","11:26,280","\"Want to see Mulan. I want to see Eddie Murphy impression\""]
["11:26,280","11:33,080","\"How would you feel if they did that that it's they include the haunted mansion in Kingdom Hearts 3?\""]
["11:33,080","11:35,580","\"But it's not the haunted mansion is the right\""]
["11:35,580","11:38,320","\"specifically the movie and Eddie Murphy\""]
["11:38,320","11:41,040","\"impersonated I\""]
["11:41,040","11:49,120","\"Already have one there's Mulan well, that's what it. Yeah as in it's Eddie Murphy in the game, but they have an impersonator doing his voice\""]
["11:51,440","11:53,440","\"I am boring.\""]
["11:53,440","11:55,440","\"Go back to the same board.\""]

["12:44,560","12:50,000","\"Okay\""]
