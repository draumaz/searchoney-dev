["01:23,240","01:33,240","\"This game does a really good job with playing tricks in your eyes with everything fading in and out when you zoom in and shit.\""]
["01:33,240","01:38,240","\"Oh yeah, and they updated the fuck out of this game.\""]
["01:38,240","01:45,240","\"is paper. That's like my favorite thing to do in this right notes and leave them around.\""]
