["04:47,040","04:50,040","\"It completely took me off guard.\""]
["04:50,040","04:53,040","\"Meg Ronin was grown in real hard.\""]

["04:58,040","04:59,040","\"Why not?\""]
["04:59,040","05:02,040","\"He was grinding his grains into his groan.\""]
["05:02,040","05:05,420","\"I was Mac Ronin when I saw it.\""]
["05:05,420","05:06,420","\"You were Matt Ronin?\""]
["05:06,420","05:07,420","\"I'm Matt Ronin.\""]
["05:07,420","05:11,580","\"I saw that movie theater three times because I just wanted to hang out with my friends.\""]
["05:11,580","05:13,580","\"I just wanted them to like me.\""]
["05:13,580","05:16,380","\"I said fine, Spider Pig's funny, please hang out with me.\""]
["05:16,380","05:18,500","\"Oh my god, Spider Pig was so funny.\""]
["05:18,500","05:21,900","\"Especially when they did the Spider-Man orchestral version of it.\""]
["05:21,900","05:23,060","\"You were that?\""]
["05:23,060","05:24,660","\"They really loved that joke.\""]
["05:24,660","05:25,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:25,660","05:26,660","\"Joke in Cacios.\""]
["05:26,660","05:29,460","\"There was a guy in my art class in school who drew Spider-Pig.\""]
["05:29,460","05:31,980","\"And he just kept drawing Spider-Pig over and over.\""]
["05:31,980","05:35,980","\"He drew a pig with Spider-Man's outfit on and he thought he was very clever.\""]
["05:35,980","05:41,180","\"Tell me what the joke is. What's the joke to Spider-Pig that he says Spider-Pig?\""]
["05:41,180","05:45,080","\"Spider-Pig? Spider-Pig? Put the pig on my big huge wig.\""]
["05:45,080","05:48,580","\"Put the pig on the ceiling, make the audience laugh.\""]
["05:48,580","05:52,380","\"I'm so much a kid. Look at my funny pig.\""]
["05:52,380","05:54,580","\"My funny pig.\""]
["05:54,580","05:56,980","\"My pig will die.\""]
["05:56,980","05:58,780","\"Why?\""]
["05:58,780","05:59,380","\"I like...\""]
["05:59,380","06:00,180","\"I like...\""]
["06:00,180","06:01,380","\"I like it against the ceiling.\""]
["06:01,380","06:04,180","\"I really like when you make Homer say menacing things.\""]
["06:04,180","06:06,520","\"It's because he's so innocent.\""]
["06:06,520","06:09,660","\"Oh, yes, my pee.\""]
["06:09,660","06:15,360","\"And one of the in one of the later episodes he gets he crashes the car drunk\""]
["06:15,360","06:17,700","\"and he blames it on Marge and she gets a DUI.\""]
["06:17,700","06:19,580","\"The lovable father.\""]
["06:19,580","06:21,500","\"Hey, Chris, it's not his fault.\""]
["06:21,500","06:22,420","\"The riders wounded.\""]
["06:22,420","06:22,940","\"What?\""]
["06:22,940","06:27,660","\"What if you got invited to a like Aaron invited you to a party and you didn't\""]
["06:27,660","06:29,460","\"really want to go, but she went to be nice.\""]
["06:29,900","06:35,700","\"And then you arrive at the party and you're really annoyed because nobody there is interesting or cool to talk to.\""]
["06:35,700","06:38,860","\"But when we're simps, I'm setting the stage, okay?\""]
["06:38,860","06:40,500","\"Homer Simpson is there.\""]
["06:40,500","06:42,300","\"He's a real cartoon in real life.\""]
["06:42,300","06:44,900","\"And you go, wow, it's Homer Simpson.\""]
["06:44,900","06:45,740","\"Let me go talk to him.\""]
["06:45,740","06:52,180","\"And then once you start talking to him, you get really uncomfortable because he keeps trying to force himself on you sexually.\""]
["06:52,180","06:56,460","\"Like he's like he's really insistent about trying to get you alone in a room.\""]
["06:56,460","06:58,220","\"It was your dream as a kid, though, wasn't it?\""]
["06:58,700","07:00,700","\"You wanted to be in the Simpsons, you wanted to meet them.\""]
["07:00,700","07:02,700","\"No, you know, I thought they were real.\""]
["07:02,700","07:04,700","\"My dad told me they were.\""]
["07:04,700","07:05,700","\"Why did he tell you that?\""]
["07:05,700","07:07,700","\"Because he's not like Santa Claus.\""]
["07:07,700","07:08,700","\"Why would he tell you that?\""]
["07:08,700","07:10,700","\"He was just fucking with me. I was like,\""]
["07:10,700","07:12,700","\"Dad, can we go visit the Simpsons?\""]
["07:12,700","07:14,700","\"He was like, yeah.\""]
["07:14,700","07:15,700","\"And I was just like, okay.\""]
["07:15,700","07:17,700","\"And then fucking a year later, I'm like,\""]
["07:17,700","07:19,700","\"I'm really patient. I want to see the Simpsons.\""]
["07:19,700","07:21,700","\"He's like, they're not real.\""]
["07:21,700","07:24,700","\"That story never got told because we...\""]
["07:24,700","07:26,700","\"Why would you want to visit a family anyway?\""]
["07:26,700","07:28,700","\"I wanted to hang out with Bart.\""]
["07:28,700","07:30,700","\"Why just Bart?\""]
["07:30,700","07:32,700","\"I call Mo and say you're gonna rape him.\""]
["07:32,700","07:34,700","\"When you're a little boy, Bart's like the coolest guy ever.\""]
["07:34,700","07:36,700","\"If you say so.\""]
["07:36,700","07:37,700","\"It's true.\""]
["07:37,700","07:42,700","\"I want to call Mo and I want to say I'm going to rape him and then Bart will go, \"\"Whoa, man, you're really cool!\"\"\""]
["07:42,700","07:46,700","\"I hate you, Mo.\""]
["07:46,700","07:52,700","\"Family guy and South Park both did that, that they have Bart and they have to show off how cool they are in front of Bart.\""]
["07:52,700","07:53,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:53,700","07:54,700","\"What'd you do?\""]
["07:54,700","07:59,940","\"Oh, I cut the head off the statue. Yeah, I just killed a kid and made him eat his own parents. Whoa, man\""]
["07:59,940","08:05,520","\"Whoa, and then he does that thing where he like blinks and leans away. I fucking Julian\""]
["08:05,520","08:11,660","\"I hate that. Why did they make every character start doing that? That's what they do. Why did they start doing that?\""]
["08:11,660","08:14,960","\"And then they look up in there. I know exactly what you're talking about\""]
["08:14,960","08:18,760","\"It's like in that episode where they like learn how to fix the rotor. Do you remember that?\""]
["08:18,760","08:22,180","\"No at the end of that they plug in the rotor and they plug it out and they do that shit\""]
["08:22,180","08:25,900","\"It's like it's like they're fucking rubbing it in your face. I fucking hate it\""]
["08:25,900","08:32,580","\"I'm surprised you knew what I was talking about. No, it's when they want to like, you know, hang on a joke and want everybody to laugh at it\""]
["08:32,580","08:34,580","\"Yeah, it's the fucking worst\""]
["08:34,580","08:38,340","\"I'm so sorry, Chris\""]
["08:38,340","08:45,300","\"Why did they start doing that because they've been apart they made all of their little fucking lovable characters smarmy assholes\""]
["08:47,740","08:51,220","\"Little sarcastic cunts will circuit stick\""]
["08:51,220","08:57,360","\"Need a sarcastic I need a circumcision what is the only character I can relate to\""]
["08:57,360","09:01,740","\"Because they didn't change it. Oh, no, they made him stay a nice fucking\""]
["09:01,740","09:04,340","\"Shaggy, oh, is he\""]
["09:04,340","09:09,580","\"He is he's professor chaos. That's always been and he's only professor chaos\""]
["09:09,580","09:14,620","\"Well at least that's right when I stopped watching it was that they would only use butters if it was professor\""]
["09:14,620","09:16,620","\"I like that. They haven't done that.\""]
["09:16,620","09:18,620","\"Professor Chaos, because it was just pathetic and funny.\""]
["09:18,620","09:20,620","\"Yeah, they haven't done that in a long time.\""]
["09:20,620","09:23,620","\"Last time I remember it was good times with weapons.\""]
["09:23,620","09:24,620","\"That was a good one.\""]
["09:24,620","09:25,620","\"And that was long ago.\""]
["09:25,620","09:27,620","\"That was like the last time the show was alright.\""]
["09:27,620","09:29,620","\"That was a great episode.\""]
["09:29,620","09:30,620","\"It was.\""]
["09:30,620","09:32,620","\"The beginning of that season turned out pretty good.\""]
["09:32,620","09:35,620","\"It was the second half when I think of starting to come downhill.\""]
["09:35,620","09:39,620","\"I think that was exactly where I would mark it,\""]
["09:39,620","09:41,620","\"that I was starting to go downhill.\""]
["09:41,620","09:46,460","\"I know the exact episode of the Simpsons that I can mark where I stopped liking it\""]

["09:51,440","09:58,180","\"I don't remember that shit at all. That was season 10. I think yeah is 9 or 10. That was the exact episode\""]
["09:58,180","10:02,540","\"Where it was like this is bad. What about the one where she got a boob job and everybody got to see your boobs?\""]
["10:02,540","10:07,980","\"There's like 15 or some shit 10 and 11 or where people market is like, okay, this is shit now\""]
