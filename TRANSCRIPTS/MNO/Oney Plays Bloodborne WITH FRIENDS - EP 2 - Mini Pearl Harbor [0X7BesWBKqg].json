["02:05,920","02:13,020","\"So it really focuses on not just hiding and running. It's like hey if you get hit go back and get some more action now\""]
["02:13,020","02:19,100","\"This will be the true test. This is always the true test of whether or not I'm gonna be on point. Oh this guy\""]

["03:23,180","03:27,140","\"So you get infected with the bad blood yeah, he gives it to you\""]

["04:36,100","04:38,700","\"I called these things souls for the longest time.\""]

["05:08,660","05:11,160","\"Hello, bye bye. - Look at the dog.\""]
["05:11,160","05:14,120","\"You can't shoot me, I'm running back and forth.\""]
["05:14,120","05:15,960","\"- Hey, this is real life, okay?\""]
["05:15,960","05:18,520","\"If someone's trying to shoot you zigzag.\""]
["05:18,520","05:21,120","\"- That's what she does do.\""]
["05:21,120","05:22,600","\"- That's what mama taught us.\""]
["05:22,600","05:24,160","\"- There's something.\""]
["05:24,160","05:26,680","\"- If you've ever been shot at, do the zigzag wing whack.\""]
["05:26,680","05:28,560","\"- Actually, it might be gazelles.\""]
["05:28,560","05:29,400","\"- Gazelles?\""]
["05:29,400","05:30,800","\"- They zigzag.\""]
["05:30,800","05:33,760","\"- I had a dream about a deer last night.\""]
["05:33,760","05:35,360","\"- Was he hot?\""]
["05:35,360","05:37,760","\"- Strength even was like kind of half burried and looking at me.\""]

["05:41,440","05:45,240","\"I wanted to leave and he grabbed me. They're like guys\""]
["05:45,240","05:53,720","\"Let's have one to come to the party. I like this guy. Oh my god. Oh my god. He had so much strawberry in him\""]
["05:53,720","05:57,640","\"Okay, Mick have you ever seen these guys climbing ladders? No, okay?\""]
["05:57,640","06:00,720","\"Because the first time I played this game. I saw one of them climbing a ladder\""]
["06:00,720","06:06,900","\"What I swear to fucking God. I think their hands are as big as I know but I swear to God. I swear it here\""]
["06:06,900","06:07,800","\"I want to show you something though.\""]
["06:07,800","06:08,640","\"- What?\""]
["06:08,640","06:09,480","\"- Check this out.\""]
["06:09,480","06:10,320","\"- That's where they patched it out.\""]
["06:10,320","06:11,900","\"- He stopped knocking on the door, right?\""]
["06:11,900","06:12,740","\"- Mm.\""]
["06:12,740","06:15,100","\"- But here's a little treat.\""]
["06:15,100","06:16,100","\"- What's the treat?\""]
["06:16,100","06:19,580","\"- Hopefully I don't aggro these guys.\""]
["06:19,580","06:22,360","\"- Tell me the treat.\""]
["06:22,360","06:25,900","\"- What's funny?\""]
["06:25,900","06:26,740","\"Goddamn it.\""]
["06:26,740","06:28,340","\"- Oh no!\""]
["06:28,340","06:29,340","\"- Don't shoot me.\""]
["06:29,340","06:30,700","\"- It's Rob Zombie.\""]
["06:30,700","06:32,060","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:32,060","06:32,940","\"- This is Rob Zombie.\""]
["06:32,940","06:34,100","\"- Oh no, is that it?\""]
["06:34,100","06:34,940","\"- Oh.\""]
["06:34,940","06:36,660","\"- You should be able to see him knocking on the door\""]
["06:36,660","06:38,400","\"Even though, damn it!\""]
["06:38,400","06:39,400","\"- Maybe they patched it out.\""]
["06:39,400","06:40,260","\"- They guessed they did.\""]
["06:40,260","06:41,100","\"- Wow, yeah.\""]
["06:41,100","06:41,940","\"- Because even after you killed him,\""]
["06:41,940","06:44,600","\"you'd see the door continue to knock.\""]
["06:44,600","06:45,440","\"That was a waste.\""]
["06:45,440","06:47,220","\"- That's the spirit of his ghoul.\""]
["06:47,220","06:48,060","\"- What a waste.\""]
["06:48,060","06:49,860","\"- Oh, look at all the coffins.\""]
["06:49,860","06:50,700","\"- Goodbye, coffins.\""]
["06:50,700","06:51,740","\"- Now they're gone.\""]
["06:51,740","06:53,100","\"- I hate coffins.\""]
["06:53,100","06:54,360","\"- Oh shit.\""]
["06:54,360","06:55,900","\"Oh, you can do that.\""]
["06:55,900","06:57,800","\"I didn't know you could come down here through there.\""]
["06:57,800","06:58,720","\"- Yes.\""]
["06:58,720","06:59,560","\"- Oh, wow.\""]
["06:59,560","07:02,180","\"- And you can murder these defenseless animals.\""]
["07:02,180","07:03,020","\"- God.\""]
["07:03,020","07:04,460","\"- What's the point of making so many coffins\""]
["07:04,460","07:06,020","\"of so many people are dying?\""]
["07:06,020","07:06,860","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:06,860","07:08,340","\"Also, they're all empty.\""]
["07:08,340","07:10,660","\"- Oh, this makes this part so much easier.\""]
["07:10,660","07:11,500","\"- Yes.\""]
["07:11,500","07:12,980","\"- This is one of the shortcuts.\""]
["07:12,980","07:15,340","\"- Everybody's gonna die, don't make coffins for him.\""]
["07:15,340","07:16,180","\"Just throw him a garbage.\""]
["07:16,180","07:17,020","\"- It's very important.\""]
["07:17,020","07:17,860","\"- Roman Apil.\""]
["07:17,860","07:18,860","\"- Julian, this whole game is gorgeous.\""]
["07:18,860","07:19,980","\"- I love how it looks.\""]
["07:19,980","07:20,820","\"- You like that?\""]
["07:20,820","07:21,660","\"Look at that.\""]
["07:21,660","07:22,500","\"- Ooh.\""]
["07:22,500","07:24,380","\"- I feel like it's a little less detailed\""]
["07:24,380","07:26,860","\"than Dark Souls.\""]
["07:26,860","07:27,700","\"- What?\""]
["07:27,700","07:28,540","\"Dark Souls 3?\""]
["07:28,540","07:30,180","\"- No, whichever one we were playing.\""]
["07:30,180","07:31,020","\"- We were playing the first one.\""]
["07:31,020","07:31,860","\"- Oh, really?\""]
["07:31,860","07:32,700","\"- No.\""]
["07:32,700","07:34,220","\"- I felt like that was a little over-detailed,\""]
["07:34,220","07:40,820","\"I think I feel like they had a good balance here. You mean detail as in like just like textures and stuff. Oh\""]
["07:40,820","07:46,780","\"I would disagree. There's the grandma from Resident Evil. She's dead\""]
["07:46,780","07:49,420","\"That's an old man. Oh, it's a lady\""]
["07:49,420","07:56,140","\"Like grandma was the scariest shit if you grab that item if it's too dark and you can't see they're shooting in the back\""]
["07:56,140","07:59,500","\"And a hole maybe it's the lighting system\""]
["07:59,500","08:03,380","\"Your characters like nearly always rimlet in this game\""]
["08:03,380","08:09,000","\"It feels like this has more specific lighting like set pieces. Oh it does\""]
["08:09,000","08:12,340","\"So maybe it's that too\""]
["08:12,340","08:16,760","\"Dark souls was busier heard because it had more even lighting or something. I don't know maybe\""]
["08:16,760","08:20,540","\"Hmm\""]
["08:20,540","08:26,420","\"Dark souls one doesn't have cloth physics either so it looks a little shitty or I probably have to go back and like compare the two\""]
["08:26,420","08:32,140","\"Cloth physics in this were they they really amped it up. Yeah, I like that. They kidnapped a man and studied his cloth\""]
["08:32,140","08:34,380","\"Oh, no in the house.\""]
["08:34,380","08:35,740","\"Sir, we need your cloth.\""]
["08:35,740","08:40,980","\"My wife knitted me this cloth.\""]
["08:40,980","08:46,380","\"Would you be upset if Julian knitted you a cloth,\""]
["08:46,380","08:48,820","\"and then someone stole it and stole the physics from it?\""]
["08:48,820","08:49,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:49,300","08:49,800","\"So--\""]
["08:49,800","08:52,140","\"So they just gave him back like a stiff board?\""]
["08:52,140","08:53,180","\"Like a stiff board?\""]
["08:53,180","08:56,460","\"Yeah, it's a stiff plane like in Blender.\""]
["08:56,460","08:57,260","\"Is it like a blivian?\""]
["08:57,260","08:58,860","\"There's no physics on it either, so I\""]
["08:58,860","09:00,220","\"can make it staircase out of it?\""]
["09:00,220","09:01,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:01,860","09:03,860","\"That would be actually way more valuable really.\""]
["09:03,860","09:07,600","\"Well if there's no physics then you could even move it.\""]
["09:07,600","09:10,440","\"You have to shoot it out of a bow.\""]
["09:10,440","09:13,240","\"I feel bad for these dogs are so mangy.\""]
["09:13,240","09:14,400","\"They are very mangy.\""]
["09:14,400","09:16,200","\"What are those dogs called in real life again?\""]
["09:16,200","09:17,360","\"This one got locked out.\""]
["09:17,360","09:18,520","\"The big woolly ones.\""]
["09:18,520","09:18,960","\"It's like,\""]
["09:18,960","09:19,620","\"\"\"Blur me yarn,\""]
["09:19,620","09:20,120","\"\"\"blur me yarn,\""]
["09:20,120","09:21,120","\"\"\"blur me yarn,\""]
["09:21,120","09:22,120","\"\"\"blur me,\""]
["09:22,120","09:22,960","\"\"\"blur me, oh my god!\"\"\""]
["09:22,960","09:25,680","\"I hate dogs in these games so much.\""]
