["00:07,500","00:10,000","\"I'm sure something was bound to happen.\""]
["00:10,000","00:13,800","\"A meteor sent this man to Gluier at the cows.\""]
["00:13,800","00:15,100","\"It's the king.\""]

["00:21,400","00:22,400","\"Oh, he's deposing!\""]
["00:22,400","00:23,400","\"Oh, Jesus!\""]
["00:23,400","00:24,400","\"He is deposing.\""]
["00:24,400","00:27,500","\"Why would he need to depose if he's not a 3D model, Chris?\""]
["00:27,500","00:28,700","\"Because he's a god.\""]
["00:28,700","00:30,700","\"Okay\""]
["00:30,700","00:36,460","\"This kind of imagery is just stupid I just don't get it man. We gotta be like that\""]

["00:48,660","00:51,500","\"He's sprinkling his parts on us\""]
["00:52,660","01:01,460","\"Oh, so is the implication that this guy creates life on a planet and then sends his little guy to like roll it up and shoot it into space?\""]
["01:01,460","01:07,280","\"I don't know. He's he's a god of something so we're playing this because Tomar says he's really good at it\""]
["01:07,280","01:12,760","\"Lyle he just said does the prince like vibrations don't say that I'm really good at it\""]
["01:12,760","01:19,420","\"Tomar says a lot stop it Tomar says that he doesn't he doesn't want to directly say what he'll do\""]
["01:19,420","01:22,140","\"But he owns a gun and he's looking for comments that uh\""]
["01:22,140","01:32,180","\"Don't skip nothing I want to see it all never skip do this is kind of like my first proper time watching\""]
["01:32,180","01:36,900","\"Oh, that's him coming toward the camera\""]

["01:43,300","01:49,700","\"He's a fucking idiot. No he so yeah, that's him fucking up and destroying all the stars. That's the plot of the game\""]
["01:49,700","01:52,540","\"He's such an asshole. I\""]
["01:52,540","02:00,780","\"Do remember seeing him get angry in a cutscene. I thought it was really scary. He is just terrifying\""]
["02:00,780","02:03,840","\"There's something about him. Oh, yeah when he's looming over you like that\""]
["02:03,840","02:11,820","\"I like the old world values this game instills back in a time when you were afraid as fuck of your dad\""]
["02:12,540","02:18,380","\"The plane like clockwork orange music we broke it. Oh, yeah, he always uses the royal we to refer to himself\""]
["02:18,380","02:23,420","\"Yes, we were naughty completely naughty. So very very sorry\""]
["02:23,420","02:27,060","\"But just between you and us\""]
["02:27,060","02:34,780","\"His cock just switched what he said there. He's got a big fucking bulge going on\""]
["02:34,780","02:39,540","\"His bowl just bigger than you are they're gonna start censoring that soon\""]
["02:40,060","02:43,860","\"You think so starting now. They're censoring cleavage and stuff now. So yeah\""]
["02:43,860","02:46,920","\"We felt the beauty did you see?\""]
["02:46,920","02:49,820","\"We smiled a genuine smile\""]
["02:49,820","02:52,380","\"Actually noticed that at anime Expo\""]
["02:52,380","02:57,620","\"They had like they had put sensor bars up over like any girl that cleavage displayed\""]
["02:57,620","03:01,820","\"What real life ones or anime ones?\""]
["03:01,820","03:05,700","\"Which is even less offensive arguably oh\""]
["03:06,380","03:12,420","\"Oh, okay, I was like, I think I'm in on real girls walking around with people like holding black bars\""]
["03:12,420","03:18,780","\"No, they're gonna censor fucking boobie, Janana, man. It's like the whole reason people watch it. Isn't it?\""]

["03:21,380","03:30,200","\"I wish to was just like one crazy billionaire type that would buy a TV channel and just like make it fucking insane\""]
["03:30,200","03:34,260","\"Start uncensoring things and making people's titties fall out of their shirts and stuff\""]
["03:34,580","03:37,920","\"The whole the whole channel is just buying like\""]
["03:37,920","03:41,580","\"shows and reality television and just\""]
["03:41,580","03:44,760","\"Unsensoring all the nudity and swearing and just like digitally\""]
["03:44,760","03:48,740","\"Altering them so everyone's like naked and flopping around\""]
["03:48,740","03:56,120","\"So he needs us to roll this up from five to ten centimeters. You better fucking kill that snail. It's making me so angry\""]
["03:56,120","03:59,240","\"It's Gary. All right\""]
["03:59,240","04:04,080","\"So now we're just gonna roll up all these little thing image eggs. Oh, yeah\""]
["04:04,080","04:06,480","\"Oh, you're on TV. Good for you.\""]
["04:06,480","04:07,280","\"Oh, yeah, look at that.\""]
["04:07,280","04:08,780","\"I remember the first time I saw,\""]
["04:08,780","04:11,280","\"I remember Super Smash Bros. Melee\""]
["04:11,280","04:13,280","\"when you're on the TV at the Pokemon Stadium.\""]
["04:13,280","04:15,180","\"I thought that was pretty cool.\""]
["04:15,180","04:17,380","\"Yeah, the first, that was the first time I saw that in a game\""]
["04:17,380","04:18,380","\"and I was blown away.\""]
["04:18,380","04:21,880","\"Smash Bros. Melee was like way ahead of its time, I feel.\""]
["04:21,880","04:23,280","\"Yeah, it really was.\""]
["04:23,280","04:24,680","\"There we go.\""]
["04:24,680","04:25,380","\"Ah!\""]
["04:25,380","04:27,380","\"We beat the tutorial level.\""]
["04:27,380","04:30,880","\"Oh, yes, almost forgot completely slipped the mind.\""]
["04:30,880","04:32,380","\"Here's your settings.\""]
["04:32,380","04:34,380","\"I almost forgot completely.\""]
["04:34,380","04:38,380","\"We're really gonna add that a few more things to be careful of like this.\""]
["04:38,380","04:41,380","\"You cannot roll up objects larger than your Katamari.\""]
["04:41,380","04:45,380","\"Crashing into larger objects will break things off the Katamari and reduce its size.\""]
["04:45,380","04:46,380","\"Oh, that's a cool thing.\""]
["04:46,380","04:48,380","\"View the tutorial again in this state box.\""]
["04:48,380","04:49,380","\"No!\""]
["04:49,380","04:55,380","\"He's such a fucking creep.\""]
["04:55,380","04:58,380","\"What would you do if he just fucking clenched his hand and crushed you?\""]
["04:58,380","05:00,380","\"I get a little turned on.\""]
["05:00,380","05:01,380","\"Okay.\""]
["05:01,380","05:03,780","\"But it's kind of my thing, Micromachro, you know?\""]
["05:03,780","05:06,080","\"It's not my thing, that is not my thing!\""]
["05:06,080","05:09,080","\"Micromachro publicly say we'd shit like that!\""]
["05:09,080","05:12,580","\"Micromachro-Roni?\""]
["05:12,580","05:15,780","\"I really actually don't like that stuff at all. It creeps me out.\""]
["05:15,780","05:18,780","\"Yeah, okay, Mr. Defensive. Mr. Backpaddle.\""]
["05:18,780","05:20,480","\"Mr. Always sits on the fence.\""]
["05:20,480","05:22,180","\"Wait, no, I'm sorry.\""]
["05:22,180","05:23,880","\"Dude, do me a favor.\""]
["05:23,880","05:25,480","\"Do me-- Oh, no, no, no, no! Go back, go back.\""]
["05:25,480","05:27,180","\"Do me a favor, go back to sound.\""]
["05:27,180","05:29,380","\"Please do me a favor, because...\""]
["05:29,980","05:31,980","\"I really don't like the music so can you turn it off?\""]
["05:31,980","05:32,980","\"Are you serious?\""]
["05:32,980","05:33,980","\"It's really annoying, yeah.\""]
["05:33,980","05:34,980","\"Please.\""]
["05:34,980","05:35,980","\"All the way off.\""]
["05:35,980","05:38,980","\"I like how it works.\""]
["05:38,980","05:39,980","\"No, please. All the way.\""]
["05:39,980","05:40,980","\"Thank you.\""]
["05:40,980","05:42,980","\"Okay. Now we can have fun.\""]
["05:42,980","05:44,980","\"Okay.\""]
["05:44,980","05:46,980","\"Why did you make us do that?\""]
["05:46,980","05:47,980","\"[laughter]\""]
["05:47,980","05:49,980","\"Wait, you just placed that against the one?\""]
["05:49,980","05:52,980","\"No, it's clearly a fucking joke.\""]
["05:52,980","05:53,980","\"Okay.\""]
["05:53,980","05:54,980","\"Here, how about half of that?\""]
["05:54,980","05:55,980","\"No, I was joking.\""]
["05:55,980","05:56,980","\"Turn it up.\""]
["05:56,980","05:58,980","\"I liked the music.\""]
["05:58,980","06:02,220","\"Now we can go to the planet and start to do the quests.\""]
["06:02,220","06:04,420","\"Is this our our blue ball?\""]
["06:04,420","06:05,420","\"Ooh.\""]
["06:05,420","06:06,420","\"Nice start.\""]
["06:06,420","06:07,420","\"Nice start.\""]
["06:07,420","06:08,420","\"Nice start.\""]
["06:08,420","06:09,720","\"Oh, spit on you.\""]
["06:09,720","06:12,220","\"I'll drop a big lube.\""]
["06:12,220","06:14,580","\"The first thing you see from that angle is his cocked.\""]
["06:14,580","06:15,580","\"It's kind of fucked up.\""]
["06:15,580","06:17,620","\"Yeah, you're like right under it.\""]
["06:17,620","06:20,320","\"That's what I'm talking to.\""]
["06:20,320","06:22,140","\"This is fucking clockwork orange music.\""]
["06:22,140","06:23,140","\"Wait, why?\""]
["06:23,140","06:24,140","\"Kickboxing, huh?\""]
["06:24,140","06:26,980","\"He just rambles a lot.\""]
["06:26,980","06:29,980","\"He's probably saying lots of quirky fun shit that dads say.\""]
["06:29,980","06:31,980","\"Today, you'll be rolling inside the house.\""]
["06:31,980","06:32,980","\"You were just here.\""]
["06:32,980","06:35,980","\"The cut of Murray should be, let's see, around Tencent.\""]
["06:35,980","06:39,700","\"Yeah, it's seriously making me play the same damn level again, except really.\""]
["06:39,700","06:41,100","\"Well you were great at it the first time.\""]
["06:41,100","06:43,500","\"I'm sure you'll be even better at it the second time.\""]
["06:43,500","06:46,540","\"This time there's a time limit and I'm allowed to go past Tencentimeter.\""]
["06:46,540","06:47,540","\"Right on.\""]
["06:47,540","06:51,100","\"Looks like those rose tinted nostalgia goggles are taken off now, Tomar.\""]
["06:51,100","06:54,100","\"Tomar has seen the world for what it is.\""]
["06:54,100","06:59,100","\"So by the way, I do gotta say, I've played Katamari.\""]
["06:59,100","07:02,860","\"Watching you play it is definitely, you can tell you know what you're doing because\""]
["07:02,860","07:06,340","\"you're not clearly wrestling with turning around and shit.\""]
["07:06,340","07:13,940","\"Yeah, it's got its own weird like tank controls thing, but once you're used to it, it's fun.\""]
["07:13,940","07:17,840","\"I guarantee you, there's plenty of way better players out there than me that make more use\""]
["07:17,840","07:22,820","\"of like, you know, like the Russian.\""]
["07:22,820","07:26,720","\"This is at least a level of like passable semi-confidence.\""]
["07:26,720","07:32,080","\"I say this is somebody who spends a majority of his time like rolling diagonally instead\""]
["07:32,080","07:34,080","\"of turning around and shit.\""]
["07:34,080","07:35,080","\"So...\""]
["07:35,080","07:37,640","\"You know, I think every game ever made.\""]
["07:37,640","07:38,960","\"You know something?\""]
["07:38,960","07:39,960","\"You know what?\""]
["07:39,960","07:40,960","\"What?\""]
["07:40,960","07:43,560","\"I think they always use the best song in the first level every last time.\""]
["07:43,560","07:46,560","\"I think there's a bunch of good songs in this game, though.\""]
["07:46,560","07:48,760","\"No, but this is the most recognizable good one.\""]
["07:48,760","07:50,520","\"This is the one that everyone hums along to.\""]
["07:50,520","07:53,120","\"This is like the Katamari theme, yeah.\""]
["07:53,120","07:56,360","\"- Like Mario has the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.\""]
["07:56,360","07:57,760","\"- Yeah, that's the first level game.\""]
["07:57,760","07:59,840","\"- Streets rage, first level, best song.\""]
["07:59,840","08:02,560","\"Yeah, I mean, obviously you wanna make\""]
["08:02,560","08:03,760","\"a strong first impression.\""]
["08:03,760","08:04,600","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:04,600","08:05,440","\"- Doom.\""]
["08:05,440","08:06,280","\"- Doom's another one.\""]
["08:06,280","08:07,600","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:07,600","08:08,440","\"- Okay, I can't touch this.\""]
["08:08,440","08:10,520","\"- It's Sonic Green Hill Zone, you know.\""]
["08:10,520","08:12,920","\"- You think Green Hill Zone is the best in that game,\""]
["08:12,920","08:16,200","\"I think maybe you're really gonna do Mikey Dirty like that?\""]
["08:16,200","08:17,200","\"- Mikey.\""]
["08:17,200","08:19,240","\"Michael Jackson, dog.\""]
["08:19,240","08:22,080","\"He's not in the first game. He's in the third one. Oh\""]
["08:22,080","08:28,280","\"Yeah, so if a creature runs away that means that there's you're big enough to capture them. Oh, that's cool\""]
["08:28,280","08:34,000","\"Fucking kill that rat get him. Do you grow with your ball? Yeah, kind of okay?\""]
["08:34,000","08:37,800","\"Who left all the slipstick over here? Oh\""]
["08:37,800","08:40,680","\"disgusting\""]
["08:40,680","08:44,080","\"Awesome. Yes destroy that. Oh, it's like\""]
["08:44,080","08:48,200","\"There I got him firing in the space now nice roll up\""]
["08:48,200","08:50,200","\"So aristocratic\""]
["08:50,200","08:58,760","\"This is a nice little pile of ooh, I can get the cell phone nice again pretty bad you can make collect calls\""]
["08:58,760","09:01,200","\"with roaming charges\""]
["09:01,200","09:04,840","\"You have one man left. Oh\""]
["09:04,840","09:08,280","\"You're already big enough\""]
["09:08,280","09:14,440","\"You got all them oranges you sure have oh look at them go you're never gonna catch a cold now\""]
["09:15,800","09:19,880","\"You'll be so strong. You won't get parvo. You won't get scurvy\""]
["09:19,880","09:26,760","\"This is so fucking weird. I like it. It's cathartic. It is yeah\""]
["09:26,760","09:30,220","\"Does the music go to the exact time of the level? No. Oh\""]
["09:30,220","09:35,160","\"It think it switches tracks if it ever gets to the end of the song\""]
["09:35,160","09:42,520","\"But in this case that the song is I think longer than the level. Are there levels that don't have time limits? I\""]
["09:42,520","09:45,000","\"don't think so\""]
["09:45,200","09:47,500","\"Cuz eventually you just pick up everything right?\""]
["09:47,500","09:51,940","\"Well, there are definitely levels where the objective isn't to grow big\""]
["09:51,940","09:59,080","\"It's to like get the largest of a particular thing, but if you accidentally get like a smaller version it just ends\""]
["09:59,080","10:04,760","\"Those are definitely my least favorite levels, so I'm not gonna play any of them. Oh, do you get the choice?\""]
["10:04,760","10:07,200","\"Yeah, those are those are optional levels\""]
["10:07,200","10:09,960","\"Royal rainbow\""]
["10:09,960","10:11,960","\"Oh, all right\""]
["10:15,040","10:19,200","\"Wow 17 centimeters by the size of this thing. This is so incredible\""]
["10:19,200","10:22,640","\"All right, I like that music that's cool\""]
["10:22,640","10:28,320","\"The thing that you collected the most of is\""]
["10:28,320","10:31,040","\"My\""]
["10:31,040","10:36,560","\"Earth really is full of things. It's I got snacks. It's a snack planet. Yeah\""]
["10:36,560","10:39,840","\"What's the difference between the star and stardust?\""]
["10:39,840","10:42,720","\"uh\""]
["10:42,720","10:50,160","\"The star will actually put the new star up in the sky like it's a record and the star dust I think just I forget what star dust does\""]
["10:50,160","10:55,920","\"Such a mean\""]
["10:55,920","10:59,160","\"You turn off the graphics in the art\""]
["10:59,160","11:02,160","\"I\""]
["11:02,160","11:07,100","\"That was make a star one dude hover above American see if the lights go out here\""]
["11:10,600","11:13,200","\"It appears in the sky just blocks out the sun.\""]
["11:13,200","11:16,000","\"Today you'll be rolling inside the house.\""]
["11:16,000","11:18,000","\"Alright, alright.\""]
