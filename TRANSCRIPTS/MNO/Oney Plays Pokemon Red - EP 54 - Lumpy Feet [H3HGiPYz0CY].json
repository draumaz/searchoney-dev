["00:01,600","00:03,360","\"On a plane!\""]
["00:03,360","00:04,360","\"*Sigh*\""]
["00:04,360","00:05,560","\"With friends!\""]
["00:05,560","00:07,960","\"*Nerce Joy*\""]
["00:07,960","00:11,600","\"Now Chris, would you go for Jenny or Joy?\""]
["00:11,600","00:13,440","\"Jenny, why?\""]
["00:13,440","00:15,440","\"His Joy looks fucking ridiculous.\""]
["00:15,440","00:17,440","\"I think it's a little kinky here.\""]
["00:17,440","00:23,080","\"And Jenny is a cop, yeah, it's more kinky and she's got a less annoying voice and she's got a less annoying personality.\""]
["00:23,080","00:24,680","\"I would probably agree with that.\""]
["00:24,680","00:28,880","\"Not that I think Joy is particularly annoying but certainly...\""]
["00:28,880","00:29,720","\"She's boring.\""]
["00:29,720","00:34,660","\"Jenny feels like more like a like an everyday person happy happy Hanukkah everybody\""]
["00:34,660","00:38,300","\"Where do you think the name Joy came from like where does that originate?\""]
["00:38,300","00:45,760","\"It's an ironic name for people who are horrible. Oh wow. She had a cruel family. Didn't she's actually very depressed\""]
["00:45,760","00:46,960","\"I want to kiss\""]
["00:46,960","00:51,080","\"Has there ever been because they the whole thing with like the infinite joy family\""]
["00:51,080","00:57,800","\"Yeah, was there ever one that was like really grizzled and like had a big scar in an eye patch? I wish they should have did that\""]
["00:59,080","01:05,080","\"There should be like an inverted town where Jenny's really niekin frail and Joey's the one running the place. That'd be cool\""]
["01:05,080","01:10,340","\"I always thought the joke was that they weren't just a huge family, but they were just fucking with them\""]
["01:10,340","01:15,580","\"Maybe I didn't see the entire series. I don't know if they were at Condit or anything\""]
["01:15,580","01:21,500","\"Do you remember their little telephones that would go ring ring ring? I really I really liked that phone\""]
["01:21,500","01:24,060","\"I like the little video phones. I'm kind of said they're gone\""]
["01:24,740","01:26,980","\"They we're talking about this\""]
["01:26,980","01:31,780","\"I think that was the charm at the beginning really is that it felt like it was a safari like you're a kid thrown into the wilderness\""]
["01:31,780","01:35,620","\"And you're just like observing these weird monsters and creatures\""]
["01:35,620","01:41,740","\"Like scientific research aspect of the whole the idea that like\""]
["01:41,740","01:46,580","\"Pokemon were still largely unknown and that you were helping to catalog them. Yeah\""]
["01:46,580","01:51,140","\"That was cool. Now Chris. Mm-hmm. These guys are really hard to catch\""]
["01:51,140","01:56,080","\"Why because it's the safari zone and it's kind of a little bit luck driven a little bit\""]
["01:56,080","02:01,160","\"So maybe we just leave me to do baby. Hey, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to get a chancey?\""]
["02:01,160","02:07,480","\"We should try getting a chancey, maybe chat fuck okay. What I love Chancy\""]
["02:07,480","02:14,080","\"Why did you say fuck cuz I just remember why was your first response to Chancy a fuck cuz she's an egg look in the idiot\""]
["02:14,080","02:17,200","\"And that's what it even says in the polka-dex egg look an idiot\""]
["02:17,200","02:19,700","\"We could have we could have tied it into professor joy\""]
["02:20,120","02:26,320","\"Professor dog do she have a blessing now she's got a pussy she probably does both\""]
["02:26,320","02:36,320","\"Everyone remembers this iconic location the stretch\""]
["02:36,320","02:41,840","\"And look what you can store them there\""]
["02:41,840","02:47,360","\"What it's doing is it's just making the safari zone encounters appear over here now\""]
["02:48,160","02:53,520","\"Really? Uh-huh. And they can't run away anymore. Wow. Wow. I'm glad they did it.\""]
["02:53,520","03:00,880","\"Do they not like carry their own like run stats? I think it's just a thing that's activated within the Safari Zone.\""]
["03:00,880","03:04,240","\"You're a little older Pokemon still run though in this game?\""]
["03:04,240","03:08,160","\"There are some that do but the ones in the Safari Zone I don't think have a move for running away.\""]
["03:08,160","03:15,200","\"So wow. I really like that it makes like an erasing sound for some reason.\""]
["03:15,200","03:21,720","\"It's probably supposed to sound like no scuttling. Yeah, it's a little feet to a feet going but to me it sounds like a racing. Oh\""]
["03:21,720","03:25,120","\"What do you think of him? Oh?\""]
["03:25,120","03:26,680","\"That's you but little\""]
["03:26,680","03:28,680","\"you're right I\""]
["03:28,680","03:32,920","\"Would not be two in the world if anyone out there knows the art of making\""]
["03:32,920","03:38,160","\"synthesizers sound like sound effects like like the way Final Fantasy 7 does\""]
["03:38,160","03:43,480","\"You know that kind of shit. You probably just have to be really good at messing with it. Yeah, no\""]
["03:43,480","03:47,100","\"Yeah, it's a skill in itself if anyone like is an expert at that\""]
["03:47,100","03:49,920","\"I will fucking pay you to show me how to do it like an expert\""]
["03:49,920","03:55,560","\"I would enjoy learning to play the synthesizer someday, but don't count on it being anytime soon Chris. Oh\""]
["03:55,560","04:04,200","\"The kid is getting blowing a bubble sure is what's this problem? Oh, I know what you're doing. He's gonna go\""]
["04:04,200","04:07,240","\"Oh, I actually think I thought him already whoops\""]
["04:07,240","04:10,920","\"My bad boy\""]
["04:10,920","04:17,920","\"Boy, me, dum, I was not that guy was a British guy. That's what everyone always says. They say\""]
["04:17,920","04:25,920","\"Which guy? This guy, they think it's a tall hat on him. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we even said that in the play through before.\""]
["04:25,920","04:32,920","\"I think a lot of people said it, so it's okay. It's common knowledge that I hate these nugget fuckers. I do too.\""]
["04:32,920","04:36,920","\"And then the guy at the end says you want to be a rocket, and then you don't even get a choice.\""]
["04:36,920","04:40,280","\"How many people do you think would have joined if they had given me?\""]
["04:40,280","04:41,480","\"Yeah, no, I think I tried.\""]
["04:41,480","04:48,720","\"I remember a kid telling me, \"\"You can play as a rocket. All you have to do is type in your name as rocket.\"\"\""]
["04:48,720","04:51,320","\"It's true. I guess that works.\""]
["04:51,320","04:58,720","\"I remember a kid telling me, \"\"You can play as me. All I gotta do is take a picture of me and put it out of your game, boy.\"\"\""]
["04:58,720","05:03,120","\"Let's see where this mysterious ocean takes us.\""]
["05:03,120","05:05,320","\"I can't imagine where it could possibly lead.\""]
["05:05,820","05:07,380","\"I was like the beginning of that song.\""]
["05:07,380","05:09,380","\"I bet into a giant toilet.\""]
["05:09,380","05:10,660","\"Wouldn't that be amusing?\""]
["05:10,660","05:12,320","\"Yeah, you'll fall off the edge of the world.\""]
["05:12,320","05:14,420","\"Watch out! It's... it's...\""]
["05:14,420","05:15,420","\"Oh...\""]
["05:15,420","05:16,720","\"That thing.\""]
["05:16,720","05:20,100","\"Pretty tent-a-queel.\""]
["05:20,100","05:21,180","\"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.\""]
["05:21,180","05:23,840","\"Thank you. I learned that one from my Pokémon Joke book.\""]
["05:23,840","05:25,780","\"A hundred and one Pokémon jokes.\""]
["05:25,780","05:27,680","\"One time I walked into Target.\""]
["05:27,680","05:30,880","\"I saw a tent. I said, \"\"Tent, ah, cool.\"\"\""]
["05:30,880","05:33,020","\"'Cause I saw a tent.\""]
["05:33,020","05:35,060","\"And then the guy came over and said, \"\"Ah!\"\"\""]
["05:35,420","05:42,100","\"A Pokemon fan I see and I said what shut up shut up. No. No. No. No shut up\""]
["05:42,100","05:46,080","\"This when I was thrown from the store\""]
["05:46,080","05:54,380","\"There's the window. Can you tell that this is Venus or yeah that giant? Oh my god. You're right. I did not look up and see that\""]
["05:54,380","05:56,900","\"That's right\""]
["05:56,900","06:04,220","\"He looks like a salad. Yeah, it looks like nothing. Hey, yes. What if you were trapped in the pokey rail?\""]
["06:04,780","06:07,380","\"Mm-hmm, and the only Pokemon you could catch\""]
["06:07,380","06:09,460","\"Was you?\""]
["06:09,460","06:10,980","\"Mewtwo?\""]
["06:10,980","06:11,680","\"I\""]
["06:11,680","06:16,020","\"Guess everything would work out. Okay. Would you be pissed off if you had the body of Mewtwo?\""]
["06:16,020","06:20,560","\"Not really. It's your head. What do you mean not really?\""]
["06:20,560","06:26,080","\"Yes, I get powers. He's got three balls for fingers. He's got a big fat tummy a big stupid tail\""]
["06:26,080","06:31,180","\"I guess that's true. He he has like psychic powers to make up for the fact that he can't grip anything\""]
["06:31,180","06:35,800","\"Well, there you go. You can just float around anyways. That's more of the body. It has your head. I assume your\""]
["06:35,800","06:41,100","\"Ridiculous Chris why is that okay proportion? You're crazy monster. It doesn't even matter\""]
["06:41,100","06:46,460","\"I think it's weird wrinkly pecks are kind of weird, but like I guess I would just learn to deal with it\""]
["06:46,460","06:48,660","\"You've got your regular old human head on top\""]
["06:48,660","06:54,920","\"Just added that that's not I did say that at the beginning. Oh, you did. Oh, did he I just wasn't big\""]
["06:54,920","06:58,060","\"It's just you with a\""]
["06:58,060","07:00,340","\"slightly more interesting body\""]
["07:00,340","07:04,140","\"More interesting if your head's on top than yeah, never mind. No\""]
["07:04,140","07:11,500","\"There you go. I know what you can't refuse. It just happened. Oh, well, then what's the point of this catch storm?\""]
["07:11,500","07:15,580","\"I don't know what was the point of it. I don't know\""]
["07:15,580","07:20,780","\"If it's just okay, you have this no, right? I have it\""]
["07:20,780","07:25,860","\"I remember Julie did that to be you asked me like what would you do if you you know?\""]
["07:25,860","07:28,460","\"Chris you said what if you would if it killed you?\""]
["07:28,460","07:30,780","\"Well, I think it was a different one.\""]
["07:30,780","07:34,880","\"That was like one of the first things we we were watching like an old 80s music video\""]
["07:34,880","07:38,100","\"And you said what would you do if you were transported back in time into this audience?\""]
["07:38,100","07:43,340","\"I said I'd probably walk out and I would have to just accept it and try to live my life now\""]
["07:43,340","07:47,740","\"Within this new time period. I'd probably have to get a job. I'd have to find a home like\""]
["07:47,740","07:53,400","\"That's what you would naturally just extend it to you got it. You got to think of a fun answer though Julian\""]
["07:54,220","08:01,020","\"You gotta spice it up. I would stand on my head. I like that dude Chris\""]
["08:01,020","08:08,100","\"Would you keep this man company until he gets hit they're standing on the dumbest area in the entire place\""]
["08:08,100","08:17,340","\"Why are you fighting these fools? He's got a level up. No, he don't he's already level 6,000. That's Fisher man\""]
["08:17,340","08:20,540","\"Hello or catch fish and then eat the heads\""]
["08:20,540","08:23,580","\"Look at his lips\""]
["08:23,580","08:30,380","\"Wow, this thing's gonna destroy it. Do you think anybody's favorite Pokemon is seeking? I like seeking\""]
["08:30,380","08:33,840","\"Yeah, I actually do like to boring to me\""]
["08:33,840","08:38,420","\"He feels too much like just a real animal and they stuck a horn on him. I kind of like how he looks he's got a\""]
["08:38,420","08:41,760","\"His face looks very aggressive goldines way better\""]
["08:41,760","08:46,240","\"See it's a cartoon here. Well, especially that spray\""]
["08:46,240","08:52,940","\"Why is goldine such a little sass and frass she's a little slut. Oh that burns some time\""]
["08:52,940","08:57,500","\"Oh, he just killed his bokem I didn't even care these guys suck\""]
["08:57,500","09:01,000","\"What's wrong with these people in this world? I?\""]
["09:01,000","09:03,580","\"Don't know\""]
["09:03,580","09:06,220","\"Can't you please just get off this thing?\""]
["09:06,220","09:09,180","\"Little stink has served sorry\""]
["09:09,180","09:17,680","\"The surfing Pokemon sprites really strange it looks like Chansey it's supposed to be you like doo doo gong I imagine\""]
["09:18,260","09:24,700","\"Maybe that or seal that's probably why they changed it to Lapras for yeah - which makes sense\""]
["09:24,700","09:27,740","\"Are you not just going back to the elite for now?\""]
["09:27,740","09:32,080","\"No, I got more Jim. What Jim is it? We had to do Viridian. Oh\""]
["09:32,080","09:37,660","\"You have to skip that at the beginning, huh? Yeah, forgot about that. They have to fight Giovanni\""]
["09:37,660","09:42,460","\"I think that's a fun detail. I like that they they tease you. You can't go in at the beginning. Yeah\""]
["09:42,460","09:46,300","\"Oh, yeah\""]
["09:46,660","09:48,660","\"Yeah\""]
["09:48,660","09:52,960","\"Ten steps back what a la la la what was that?\""]
["09:52,960","10:01,260","\"Oh, I thought you were doing MC scat cat. Oh, I was but that was the sound you were doing the Pokemon sound working\""]

["10:03,700","10:05,700","\"Yeah, he makes the 10\""]
["10:05,700","10:12,320","\"Are you taking about the sound at the beginning of the song no\""]
["10:13,140","10:19,340","\"I was just making the Pokemon cry, but I think it would be funny if this really ugly hey wait use cut\""]
["10:19,340","10:23,780","\"But I'll kill the Pokemon do it no do poke good\""]
["10:23,780","10:27,900","\"Troy the mall good\""]

["10:34,500","10:38,060","\"Yeah, so you can just get rid of grassy don't want to walk through yeah, exactly\""]
["10:39,660","10:45,120","\"Except it takes a long time. That's the downside to it. So it's like yeah, if you really want to waste your time cutting all the grass\""]
["10:45,120","10:49,080","\"You can do it. It's neat. I like it. I guess that's true\""]
["10:49,080","10:54,380","\"It wouldn't really speed you up that much. Do the standing on the tree trick. I'm in town of palette. Oh\""]
["10:54,380","10:58,500","\"Why is it colored this way? Was this your palette or was this in the game? Oh?\""]
["10:58,500","11:01,300","\"No, I guess that's the natural palette\""]
["11:01,300","11:08,520","\"It's great. Oh no, is there a reason for you to go back there?\""]
["11:09,620","11:11,100","\"-Cris- -Cris to Professor Floki!\""]
["11:11,100","11:12,740","\"-Cris said to go do the tree thing.\""]

["11:13,660","11:14,540","\"-Stand on a tree.\""]
["11:14,540","11:16,260","\"-That was everybody's favorite.\""]
["11:16,260","11:16,760","\"-Yeah.\""]
["11:16,760","11:19,700","\"-You guys were very daring with all these glitches.\""]
["11:19,700","11:22,140","\"I never tried to abuse my glitches.\""]
["11:22,140","11:24,380","\"-That's not like glitch. That's just being clever, Julian.\""]
["11:24,380","11:26,700","\"-I wouldn't really call it much of a glitch.\""]
["11:26,700","11:28,380","\"It doesn't seem like a problem.\""]
["11:28,380","11:29,820","\"-I just don't know what you guys are talking about,\""]
["11:29,820","11:30,980","\"so I assume it's a glitch.\""]
["11:30,980","11:33,780","\"-My god, you're level 63 around all these little fellas.\""]
["11:33,780","11:37,300","\"-Why didn't they ever show them the anime that Ash is just picking on,\""]
["11:37,300","11:39,540","\"like, level 2 Pokemon with Pikachu?\""]
["11:39,540","11:41,660","\"destroying them for 50 episodes.\""]
["11:41,660","11:42,340","\"Oh no.\""]
["11:42,340","11:44,700","\"That's the actual Pokemon experience.\""]
["11:44,700","11:45,660","\"Believe you.\""]
["11:45,660","11:50,820","\"That's one thing I will say, I like about the very newest one is you can avoid this shit.\""]
["11:50,820","11:54,100","\"It's just such a tedious process.\""]
["11:54,100","11:54,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:54,600","11:57,340","\"Okay.\""]
["11:57,340","11:59,340","\"It was a limitation of the time.\""]
