["00:30,680","00:36,000","\"But you know what I never got down the kid there's a counter system in this game and that's something I never got good at\""]
["00:36,000","00:41,320","\"It's like it never beat the final dude because you basically have to counter out of most of his moves\""]
["00:41,320","00:45,800","\"You have to buy a counter and hit him over the head with it. Wait, what's the name gonna be?\""]
["00:45,800","00:51,320","\"Listen, you've been you've been waiting 25 years for your redemption round. This is it. Yeah, okay. What's column?\""]

["00:56,640","01:00,560","\"Slopsy get back in the ring. Yeah, all right\""]
["01:00,560","01:08,360","\"You can't get to the next circuit until you beat one and then there's after you have to get a perfect record on all three circuits\""]
["01:08,360","01:12,120","\"Then it opens up star road it opens up the special circuit\""]
["01:12,120","01:19,720","\"Wait, so it's kind of like a cool mode. Okay. This is just mean. This is ageism. It's Gabby J\""]

["01:29,120","01:31,480","\"He's gay\""]
["01:31,480","01:35,460","\"Wait, so you're in the foreground yet. You're smaller than this fucking monolith of an old guy\""]
["01:35,460","01:40,760","\"So cool. Let's be honest. This guy is ripped. I want to be in this good of shape when I'm when I'm his age\""]
["01:40,760","01:44,880","\"He looks like an English. Oh, you hit me not a French. I'm embarrassed\""]
["01:44,880","01:52,160","\"Also, why does little Mac have like trunks from super dragon bald hair?\""]

["01:58,160","01:59,160","\"This is bear hugger.\""]
["01:59,160","02:00,160","\"It's a Canadian asshole.\""]
["02:00,160","02:01,840","\"You can't punch him in the stomach.\""]
["02:01,840","02:02,840","\"That's the thing with fat, okay?\""]
["02:02,840","02:03,840","\"In the right corner.\""]
["02:03,840","02:04,840","\"Really?\""]
["02:04,840","02:05,840","\"Like fat?\""]
["02:05,840","02:08,080","\"Fat characters in this game are invulnerable to stomach punches.\""]
["02:08,080","02:09,840","\"I'll show you what happens when it...\""]
["02:09,840","02:11,440","\"Oh fuck, that's right, I have to talk.\""]
["02:11,440","02:13,400","\"That is an illegal move by the way.\""]
["02:13,400","02:17,720","\"Well, all the moves in this game are illegal, but he always predictably does that.\""]
["02:17,720","02:20,320","\"But see, if you punch him in the stomach, he does that.\""]
["02:20,320","02:21,880","\"What, he licks your hand?\""]
["02:21,880","02:23,880","\"What the fuck?\""]

["02:32,440","02:38,440","\"Look at those things. No look what he's doing two little cantaloupes in his pants. He's got like a huge ass dick. Look at that. Yeah\""]
["02:38,440","02:46,180","\"Why is this not killing him could have done a lot better. Oh, no three knockdowns is always a technical\""]
["02:46,180","02:48,180","\"Oh no. I got a new rock out.\""]
["02:48,180","02:52,180","\"Ehehehe. That's a technical fail!\""]
["02:52,180","02:54,180","\"I love this music.\""]
["02:54,180","02:58,180","\"It's kind of like a fake guitar, you know.\""]
["02:58,180","03:03,180","\"Would you be impressed if you went to a rock concert and their real guitar sounded like that?\""]
["03:03,180","03:04,180","\"I almost saw that.\""]

["06:06,560","06:11,000","\"I there were certain things and games that couldn't deal with like whenever games had time limits. They used to freak me out\""]
["06:11,000","06:17,800","\"I couldn't deal with that. Hmm. It's literally never been an issue for me in this game\""]
["06:17,800","06:21,880","\"I don't know the idea of a fight actually going on for three full minutes\""]
["06:21,880","06:28,260","\"It's pretty rare either you're getting your ass kicked or you're winning in this game. There's not much in between\""]

["06:51,420","06:55,720","\"You somehow managed to pick up a magnifying glass hidden in the game's code and you still missed them\""]
["06:55,720","06:59,720","\"You actually stuck your penis in one of them\""]
["06:59,720","07:04,980","\"Peed walking around walking around and then drop it didn't even know you were doing it\""]
["07:04,980","07:07,240","\"Halo 3 is a good game\""]

["08:26,960","08:29,300","\"And then they start doing it\""]
["08:29,300","08:31,300","\"You just watch them do it\""]
["08:31,300","08:37,180","\"And then you use a time machine and you go like six thousand years of the future when they've assimilated and they're all doing it\""]
["08:37,180","08:41,700","\"Still for this day. Yeah, but you know what would be funny is that we'd all be doing it at that point\""]

["09:45,100","09:51,800","\"Tomar I dare you to grab a stapler and pull your balls up over your dick like a little igloo and staple them to your body\""]
["09:51,800","09:54,100","\"To hold it in place\""]
["09:54,100","09:58,340","\"One time when I first met Tomar\""]
["09:58,340","10:03,300","\"I don't know if I told his story already we were at new grounds and he was on we were on a staircase and he was like\""]

["10:54,740","10:57,740","\"Yeah, and clearly the man said it in English, not in Spanish.\""]
