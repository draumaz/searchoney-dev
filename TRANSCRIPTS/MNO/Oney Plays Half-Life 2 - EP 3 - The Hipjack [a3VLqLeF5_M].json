["12:20,680","12:25,840","\"So should just be a law that says if someone's a paparazzi, you can just murder them indiscriminately.\""]
["12:25,840","12:27,920","\"Yeah, hunt them for sport.\""]
["12:27,920","12:30,640","\"Have I told you guys about my kill lanes idea?\""]
["12:30,640","12:31,680","\"What's a kill lane, son?\""]
["12:31,680","12:35,280","\"Okay, so basically, like, parking lots, right?\""]
["12:35,280","12:36,200","\"Everyone hates them.\""]
["12:36,200","12:37,600","\"I know Tomar hates them.\""]
["12:37,600","12:38,240","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["12:38,240","12:42,640","\"I propose that, uh, in the middle of each lane,\""]
["12:42,640","12:44,200","\"there's like a red line.\""]
["12:44,200","12:46,160","\"And if pedestrians cross over that line\""]
["12:46,160","12:49,640","\"into the middle section, you can legally run them over.\""]
["12:49,640","12:52,200","\"Now, I know what you're thinking.\""]
["12:52,200","12:54,240","\"I know you're thinking, what about like kids and stuff?\""]
["12:54,240","12:55,600","\"No one's gonna run over a kid\""]
["12:55,600","12:57,760","\"and no one's gonna wanna run over a kid.\""]
["12:57,760","13:05,340","\"So that's why my second- my second piece of legislation is uh, if you see a child on the outside of a temple lane\""]
["13:05,340","13:08,680","\"No, you you get arrested if you don't run over them\""]
["13:08,680","13:14,320","\"So that that gives parents extra incentive to fucking keep their kids out of the middle of the road\""]
["13:14,320","13:19,280","\"And it gives people incentive to run over children, which is something they would normally not be compelled to do\""]
["13:19,280","13:22,880","\"I don't know a lot of seems like a bad idea. No, I think it'll be great\""]
["13:22,880","13:27,280","\"It'll make fucking like a Costco parking lots and shit so much more tolerable\""]
["13:27,280","13:30,740","\"Costco parking lots are among the worst.\""]
["13:30,740","13:35,540","\"Yeah, it's like Costco and like Walmart parking lots are fucking terrible.\""]
["13:35,540","13:37,740","\"But yeah, Costco ones especially.\""]
["13:37,740","13:39,540","\"I don't know what it is.\""]

["14:02,100","14:03,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["14:03,100","14:10,100","\"Like it's super, like it's very difficult to tell if you've gotten turned around until you like hit something and you're like god damn it.\""]
