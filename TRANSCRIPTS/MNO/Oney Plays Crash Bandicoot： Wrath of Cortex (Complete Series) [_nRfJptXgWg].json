["04:45,440","04:50,180","\"at least they kept sounds unlike the new game that made them worse\""]
["04:50,180","04:54,660","\"here's the the opening to National Geographic\""]
["04:54,660","04:57,500","\"all the at least they like mixed up the jumping enemies see that\""]

["05:05,380","05:10,520","\"wow this game is good now this game is the best I remember the movement being\""]
["05:10,520","05:11,540","\"really awkward\""]
["05:11,540","05:18,120","\"Yes, how does it feel Chris? It's really floaty, but it's it's not as bad as it could be. I mean it's not crash one at least\""]

["05:51,860","05:56,700","\"You know as much as this game stinks at least it's easy to talk over\""]
["05:56,700","05:59,020","\"I like that the camera is having a hard time keeping up\""]
["05:59,020","06:05,660","\"I don't like the way the box is breaking this money. How this is the game. Cute. Well, there's a reflection\""]
["06:06,500","06:13,580","\"Was um was the ps2 version like this I don't remember I thought I heard the that one was worse what?\""]
["06:13,580","06:20,260","\"Lord maybe is the other way. I forget which one's supposed to be worse one of them runs worse and looks worse\""]
["06:20,260","06:22,260","\"How come he's going so fast?\""]
["06:22,260","06:25,420","\"He's got things to do. Oh my god. You're right\""]
["06:25,420","06:30,660","\"Wow, oh which looks better the boxes in this game or the boxes in the\""]
["06:31,500","06:36,740","\"D- remake I was gonna say um all I actually don't know what the boxes look like in the remake\""]
["06:36,740","06:40,820","\"I haven't seen them yet. They actually look very similar to these really yes\""]
["06:40,820","06:47,780","\"Oh actually they're almost completely right there. Yeah, I think they base the new crates off these things. Yeah\""]
["06:47,780","06:56,180","\"These look I'd have to oh look at the way the TNT explodes always bothered me. Oh, yeah, just kind of falls apart. Yeah\""]
["06:58,340","07:03,160","\"Even as a kid I was like that's boring but listen to that CD quality music\""]
["07:03,160","07:10,560","\"I'm pretty sure the music just fades out and starts playing again. That happened a lot during that time. Yeah, they\""]

["07:52,760","07:58,240","\"Oh wait it ran at 60 for a little bit there because you have to render anything\""]
["07:58,240","08:02,980","\"There's something good about his run cycle. I don't know. There's a man moves. Oh\""]
["08:02,980","08:10,040","\"You're right a mammoth doing he's jump on him. What the fuck there's two trees\""]

["08:31,840","08:34,280","\"Oh, I\""]
["08:34,280","08:39,280","\"Think in the second game. Oh my god. Look at the skull ones. I'm not sure though\""]
["08:39,280","08:43,280","\"No, the music in this game so fucking different\""]
["08:47,600","08:52,120","\"It reminds me of um one of those like Tetris remakes you get on the Xbox\""]
["08:52,120","08:57,000","\"They always do that kind of music I don't know why I\""]
["08:57,000","09:01,320","\"Guess this is more sorry the song ended\""]
["09:01,320","09:06,440","\"It's so slow they could have at least like played it three times and then done that\""]
["09:06,440","09:14,680","\"What what sound?\""]
["09:16,880","09:18,880","\"It's probably the same\""]
["09:18,880","09:25,640","\"I swear there's a that that mammoth with cel shaded. Did you like time splitters one or two?\""]
["09:25,640","09:31,000","\"I like both of them. I like second one butter. I like to more than three. This is my house\""]
["09:31,000","09:34,760","\"What did you say Julian? That was my house\""]
["09:34,760","09:39,480","\"What a crystal yeah, you live in the crystal dome\""]
["09:39,480","09:46,360","\"Would you fucking flip Jesus in the crystal coconut? Oh dear good slow. That is\""]
["09:46,360","09:52,040","\"Yeah, see look at the ma- ma-mo dude, I did it. It just kind of appeared with no\""]
["09:52,040","09:55,680","\"No polish it was goopy apparently\""]
["09:55,680","10:02,760","\"Julian when you were little would you point at girls and say I'd give her a poke if the telly was broke? No\""]
["10:02,760","10:11,380","\"Julian was the biggest city you ever suck dude. You are a very mean child. I didn't say that. There's a secret. There's a secret\""]
["10:11,380","10:14,560","\"What we gotta go for a hundred are you serious?\""]
["10:15,200","10:21,120","\"Crash Band of Christian use an analog stick. You're right. You should use a d-pad. Remind me what the difference is again\""]
["10:21,120","10:24,480","\"What do you mean between analog and digital?\""]
["10:24,480","10:28,800","\"You can go in any direction you want with analog d-pad you can only go in eight directions\""]
["10:28,800","10:35,840","\"And with analog you can choose how fast you want to go you can do this. Yeah, you can do a little bit good then a little sassy walk\""]
["10:35,840","10:37,320","\"Isn't that better?\""]
["10:37,320","10:42,520","\"Well old crash games were designed around the fact it was a d-pad because there's always precise angles for everything\""]
["10:42,520","10:45,300","\"And it had to be because it was only a deep out of the time\""]
["10:45,300","10:50,680","\"How do you belly flop you push the fucking you push this button, but he only does it sometimes\""]
["10:50,680","10:55,200","\"Why is it that button not the whatever it's the fucking game camp?\""]
["10:55,200","11:01,240","\"Yeah, but it could be the triggers don't say that word why cuz around with the other one\""]
["11:01,240","11:04,360","\"I miss only triggers. Why won't they come back?\""]
["11:04,360","11:08,920","\"They only made one comment. They what was the comment?\""]
["11:09,480","11:14,180","\"What was the comment about it was about how they got scared because crash was\""]
["11:14,180","11:18,440","\"Walking towards the screen. Oh, it's pretty scary. That's pretty funny\""]
["11:18,440","11:22,860","\"He doesn't do it have the time because the frame rate that's dropping. Oh, you think that's why?\""]
["11:22,860","11:27,380","\"Yeah, but don't most games have like it stores it in a bank until or something\""]
["11:27,380","11:33,600","\"It depends on how they're coded most games do that though, right? Most games have frame skipping\""]
["11:33,600","11:39,060","\"So it can actually handle your input anyways. Yeah, I also slow down like this doesn't actually slow the game down\""]
["11:39,060","11:45,200","\"Yeah, it's making it go slow mo what what you look at I said it's the worst explosion I've ever seen I told you even\""]
["11:45,200","11:47,900","\"I swear to God even as a little kid that really disappointed me\""]
["11:47,900","11:54,280","\"Because everything had a lot of weight and punch to it in the other games all the effects were really nice\""]
["11:54,280","11:57,100","\"It's this music\""]
["11:57,100","12:01,580","\"Not satisfying. I'll tell you that. Oh, that's the that's the invincibility\""]
["12:01,580","12:05,940","\"For some reason. Yeah, I thought it was like dangers. I don't know why they did\""]
["12:07,380","12:09,380","\"getting chased down by a fucking a psycho.\""]
["12:09,380","12:10,580","\"I'm hitting jump.\""]
["12:10,580","12:11,580","\"I'm hitting jump.\""]
["12:11,580","12:12,580","\"I'm hitting jump.\""]
["12:12,580","12:13,580","\"Yeah, I know.\""]
["12:13,580","12:14,580","\"You have to like go of it.\""]
["12:14,580","12:15,580","\"What?\""]
["12:15,580","12:16,580","\"I jump.\""]
["12:16,580","12:20,100","\"So, okay, yeah, you hit crouch and then you jump.\""]
["12:20,100","12:23,220","\"Well, if you skid, you can do the jump.\""]
["12:23,220","12:24,220","\"That's so weird though.\""]
["12:24,220","12:25,540","\"Why is it set up that way?\""]
