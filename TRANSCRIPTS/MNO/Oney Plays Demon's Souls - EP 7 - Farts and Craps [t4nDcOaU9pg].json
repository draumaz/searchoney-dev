["02:21,720","02:27,080","\"I think I I'm not gonna lie when I did that and I I was naturally kind of looking up\""]
["02:27,080","02:32,120","\"I just assumed like oh yeah, I'd open that game that kind of felt like an unnecessary whole fancy cutscene yeah\""]
["02:32,120","02:37,280","\"Wait, what the fuck what's wrong? Oh? Okay this way\""]
["02:37,280","02:40,440","\"It wasn't Frederator the one that made the sound\""]

["02:47,520","02:53,240","\"That's what it is right animation contrary to prior belief. I was never affiliated with Frederator\""]
["02:53,240","02:56,520","\"Is that belief that you were no?\""]
["02:56,520","03:00,400","\"I was like, I don't know what people thinking about your animation\""]
["03:00,400","03:04,400","\"Due to heads your drawings they interviewed us one time\""]
["03:04,400","03:07,320","\"Us as in you and Zach\""]
["03:07,320","03:13,320","\"Yeah, I'd sleepy cabin because they wanted to like oh I could go across this and get that yeah\""]
["03:13,320","03:16,320","\"They wanted to like work with you guys or they were just like no\""]
["03:16,320","03:19,620","\"They were just like it was a cartoon show they were doing on Frederator kind of like a\""]
["03:19,620","03:22,520","\"It's a cartoony talk show\""]
["03:22,520","03:27,780","\"And it was delightful. I was gonna say that's actually sounds pretty cool. It was pretty sweet\""]
["03:27,780","03:33,600","\"They asked the important questions. Wow a new fog gate. What are you going to discover?\""]
["03:33,600","03:37,100","\"Okay, we got coal I\""]
["03:37,100","03:42,540","\"Can't I'm getting a vibe from this level that it's a it's a coal minor theme whoa\""]
["03:42,540","03:45,380","\"Oh, is he gonna explode?\""]
["03:45,380","03:46,940","\"No, he's coming though.\""]
["03:46,940","03:47,780","\"Be careful.\""]
["03:47,780","03:48,620","\"Oh, he's like a thing.\""]
["03:48,620","03:50,020","\"It's a little wall get go.\""]
["03:50,020","03:51,820","\"I wonder how much damage I'll do to him.\""]

["03:53,580","03:55,180","\"Okay, I'm not as afraid anymore.\""]
["03:55,180","03:57,180","\"Don't step on that thing.\""]
["03:57,180","04:00,700","\"I thought he was still alive just 'cause I was flinging him.\""]
["04:00,700","04:02,460","\"Okay, okay, okay.\""]
["04:02,460","04:06,740","\"I'm afraid that one of these times I break a bunch of barrels,\""]
["04:06,740","04:08,060","\"it's gonna be the fire ones\""]
["04:08,060","04:11,180","\"and I'm not gonna realize it 'til it's too late.\""]
["04:11,180","04:13,180","\"I think if you break them with a sword you're okay, right?\""]
["04:13,180","04:15,400","\"I don't know.\""]
["04:15,400","04:18,300","\"Oh yeah, because it takes like a fire bomb to really frick them.\""]
["04:18,300","04:21,780","\"That's always a, that's always a weird thing in a lot of games where\""]
["04:21,780","04:25,220","\"sometimes you'll just like touch off a fire barrel\""]
["04:25,220","04:27,440","\"and go keplui.\""]
["04:27,440","04:28,380","\"All right, here's a note.\""]
["04:28,380","04:30,580","\"Be wary of the Amine's magic.\""]
["04:30,580","04:34,820","\"All right, I'm not taking that to know.\""]
["04:34,820","04:35,580","\"Is this lava?\""]
["04:35,580","04:36,900","\"No, it's just different color.\""]
["04:36,900","04:38,060","\"It's just very shiny.\""]
["04:38,060","04:39,260","\"That did scare me though.\""]
["04:39,260","04:40,020","\"I was like, is it?\""]
["04:40,220","04:42,220","\"Is this sorbet?\""]
["04:42,220","04:45,220","\"Just doing good. You're doing good. You're doing good.\""]
["04:45,220","04:47,220","\"Watch out for this room though.\""]
["04:47,220","04:49,220","\"This is a roomy room if you get me.\""]
["04:49,220","04:50,220","\"What is this?\""]
["04:50,220","04:52,220","\"Is this a Geico-comer?\""]
["04:52,220","04:54,220","\"What's going on here?\""]
["04:54,220","04:55,220","\"Uh...\""]
["04:55,220","04:56,220","\"Jokes.\""]
["04:56,220","04:59,220","\"Your fucking voice did a weird thing there when...\""]
["04:59,220","05:02,220","\"It was like two voices on top of each other.\""]
["05:02,220","05:03,220","\"Oh shit.\""]
["05:03,220","05:05,220","\"I've got a good item.\""]
["05:05,220","05:08,220","\"Take a step out.\""]
["05:08,220","05:13,260","\"No don't do that it'll kill you that's lava will it instantly yeah even if I hop\""]
["05:13,260","05:16,780","\"skip and fuck yeah you know no it's not like Dark Souls that'll you'll fall\""]
["05:16,780","05:25,140","\"into it and die oh wow okay so they got the pointers are you guys learned\""]
["05:25,140","05:31,380","\"man how far do you think we are from games that just like learn as you play\""]
["05:31,380","05:39,180","\"Like AI oh I don't think that far if that like people really dialed down and\""]
["05:39,180","05:43,140","\"focused just on that I think that it's kind of it's just like where the focus\""]
["05:43,140","05:47,420","\"is all right no go down there go down there this is shortcut down here also I've\""]
["05:47,420","05:51,460","\"recently saw a video of a guy who's like you know that like AI deep-thinking\""]
["05:51,460","05:54,740","\"shit where you plug in a bunch of information and it learns over time yeah\""]
["05:54,740","05:58,860","\"this guy like did that with a like a little car and a racetrack and he was\""]
["05:58,860","06:03,340","\"just like the only information he gave the car was that it could drive forward and turn left and\""]
["06:03,340","06:08,940","\"right and like he left it overnight and at first it was just like crashing into the wall over and\""]
["06:08,940","06:12,860","\"over and over and over yeah so then he like left it like overnight he came back and it was literally\""]
["06:12,860","06:17,660","\"like drifting around the racetrack perfectly every time. There's like the initial D song playing\""]
["06:17,660","06:22,940","\"in terms of like to it. It's fucking it's so scary that's awesome but terrifying. If they applied\""]
["06:22,940","06:28,540","\"that to a game like this like you would never be able to defeat anything. No well yeah I've\""]
["06:28,540","06:30,100","\"I've actually never thought about that.\""]
["06:30,100","06:31,700","\"- There'll be great view ahead.\""]
["06:31,700","06:33,420","\"- Rate it, rate it, rate it.\""]
["06:33,420","06:34,420","\"- What do you press to rate?\""]
["06:34,420","06:37,420","\"I think select, maybe not.\""]
["06:37,420","06:39,700","\"Press and start, triangle.\""]
["06:39,700","06:41,300","\"I don't wanna like roll off the cliff.\""]
["06:41,300","06:43,740","\"- Back drop off the cliff, yeah.\""]
["06:43,740","06:45,700","\"You know what, never, never mind.\""]
["06:45,700","06:47,380","\"I've always, even in Dark Souls,\""]
["06:47,380","06:50,260","\"I didn't realize how you could rate stuff.\""]
["06:50,260","06:52,700","\"Is it like up or down or right on the D-pad\""]
["06:52,700","06:53,620","\"and you press X?\""]
["06:53,620","06:55,900","\"- It was always really satisfying to drop a message\""]
["06:55,900","06:58,780","\"and then just get free like, estus later.\""]
["06:58,780","06:59,860","\"Wait, that's how it works?\""]
["06:59,860","07:01,060","\"I was pretty sure, yeah.\""]
["07:01,060","07:04,420","\"That if you gave messages, it like rewarded you?\""]
["07:04,420","07:05,260","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:05,260","07:06,100","\"- And if people rated them.\""]
["07:06,100","07:07,500","\"- I never did that.\""]
["07:07,500","07:09,020","\"- Oh yeah, so this is a shortcut right here.\""]
["07:09,020","07:11,140","\"- I never got involved with putting down messages.\""]
["07:11,140","07:12,860","\"I feel bad now.\""]
["07:12,860","07:14,660","\"I just didn't think I had anything worth saying\""]
["07:14,660","07:16,820","\"and I jumped into Dark Souls real late.\""]
["07:16,820","07:17,840","\"So I was like, yeah.\""]
["07:17,840","07:20,420","\"Down.\""]
["07:20,420","07:21,260","\"Do I wanna go?\""]
["07:21,260","07:23,140","\"Oh, it's a shortcut back to the start.\""]
["07:23,140","07:24,900","\"- Yeah, so now you can just come right here next time.\""]
["07:24,900","07:31,180","\"Okay, I get why that was totally worth it. Yeah, pretty cool. All right. It's a he's pretty neat\""]
["07:31,180","07:33,540","\"It's not like my favorite\""]
["07:33,540","07:37,740","\"Like you know mines and stuff, but it's it's not fucking Blighttown\""]
["07:37,740","07:46,540","\"So I'll take it. I don't yeah, yeah one way into Blighttown. I hate I like I like the other way you can go in\""]
["07:46,540","07:49,700","\"Yeah, I like what?\""]
["07:49,780","07:52,780","\"- Yeah, like the design of it,\""]
["07:52,780","07:56,300","\"that you can actually like skip a lot of it if you want.\""]
["07:56,300","08:01,020","\"That I like that it's almost intentionally just like shitty.\""]
["08:01,020","08:02,100","\"But playing it on console,\""]
["08:02,100","08:04,700","\"the frame rate literally just like is unplayable.\""]
["08:04,700","08:05,540","\"- Oh yeah.\""]
["08:05,540","08:06,620","\"- So it,\""]
["08:06,620","08:09,300","\"- At least favorite place in Dark Souls one is like\""]
["08:09,300","08:10,540","\"the Duke's archives.\""]
["08:10,540","08:11,580","\"I never enjoy that.\""]
["08:11,580","08:15,060","\"- Yeah, it felt, I like the areas kind of before\""]
["08:15,060","08:17,260","\"and after it, like where it's at.\""]
["08:17,260","08:20,620","\"but it's yeah, I always forget about it.\""]
["08:20,620","08:23,440","\"Just 'cause I've only beaten Dark Souls\""]
["08:23,440","08:26,180","\"all the way to the end and once,\""]
["08:26,180","08:29,380","\"but then I've replayed it getting all the way to like,\""]
["08:29,380","08:32,020","\"you know, you can get to fucking,\""]
["08:32,020","08:33,760","\"- And Orlando. - And Orlando in like\""]
["08:33,760","08:35,620","\"a couple hours once you know what you're doing.\""]
["08:35,620","08:37,460","\"- Yeah. - So I do that, I beat O&S\""]
["08:37,460","08:38,580","\"and then I'd be like, yeah.\""]
["08:38,580","08:40,140","\"- Yeah, that's pretty much the end game.\""]
["08:40,140","08:42,360","\"Like it's the funnest end game you can do.\""]
["08:42,360","08:43,200","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:43,200","08:45,420","\"- 'Cause it's a really good climax.\""]
["08:45,420","08:48,340","\"Oh shit, watch out.\""]
["08:48,340","08:50,760","\"These guys throw big fucking balls.\""]
["08:50,760","08:54,100","\"- Huh.\""]
["08:54,100","08:57,460","\"I like the attack he does out of a roll.\""]
["08:57,460","08:58,820","\"- Oh shit, watch out, watch out.\""]
["08:58,820","08:59,660","\"- Right.\""]
["08:59,660","09:01,620","\"- Can he get slapped?\""]
["09:01,620","09:03,980","\"Oh dude, I wish I had a fire bomb, 'cause this.\""]
["09:03,980","09:05,500","\"- Ah, oh they do.\""]
["09:05,500","09:07,220","\"- Oh no, yeah they don't explode.\""]
["09:07,220","09:09,040","\"Check this out.\""]
["09:09,040","09:09,880","\"- Did he do that on purpose?\""]
["09:09,880","09:10,720","\"- I wanna try to parry him.\""]
["09:10,720","09:12,540","\"Oh that was so early.\""]
["09:12,540","09:14,460","\"Okay, I'm kind of playing with fire with him,\""]
