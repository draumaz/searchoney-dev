["00:10,420","00:12,540","\"Here's some little-known trivia.\""]
["00:12,540","00:13,040","\"*gasp*\""]
["00:13,040","00:18,560","\"The real Winnie the Pooh, as in the little boy's doll-d-boy, was-d-dolled toy.\""]
["00:18,560","00:21,820","\"Was stuffed with a cocaine of- well-fisty.\""]
["00:21,820","00:23,480","\"*laughing*\""]
["00:23,480","00:24,560","\"Yes, that's very true.\""]
["00:24,560","00:28,280","\"Whenever people would ask, \"\"What was Walt doing, drugs?\"\"\""]
["00:28,280","00:30,280","\"The answer is yes.\""]
["00:30,280","00:33,440","\"You know the original Mickey Mouse was just a recording of a mouse?\""]
["00:33,440","00:38,740","\"But Walt was on drugs and he was shaking the camera so much it looked like a cartoon.\""]
["00:38,740","00:44,560","\"Jesus, I'm sorry everybody I'm doing real bad.\""]
["00:44,560","00:51,320","\"It was the remasters that made it look more like a cartoon.\""]
["00:51,320","00:57,540","\"Hence he got wrongly credited as an animator rather than a frantic camera shaker.\""]
["00:57,540","01:00,180","\"Walt Disney is an animator as we hold on.\""]
["01:00,180","01:01,020","\"Jesus.\""]

["01:18,340","01:23,140","\"What were they smoking, crack when they made that movie?\""]
["01:23,140","01:26,540","\"I personally preferred the Frozen short before it.\""]
["01:26,540","01:31,460","\"No, I didn't know there was and I didn't know there was a frozen sure it's 20 minutes long\""]
["01:31,460","01:38,060","\"That's not a short. Yeah, that's a long they put it there to sell frozen stuff\""]
["01:38,060","01:40,580","\"Would you believe?\""]
["01:40,580","01:43,580","\"That's all about Olaf. Would you believe I?\""]
["01:43,580","01:46,500","\"Then he he gets oh\""]
["01:46,500","01:52,900","\"He falls down and he splits into a bunch of little Olaf's and he says oh no, it's the Olaf teenies\""]
["01:54,340","02:02,980","\"introducing each of our male have a unique personality. Can I just say I saw the movie with a friend and he looked very uncomfortable when Olaf started going\""]
["02:02,980","02:09,780","\"He started singing really childish lyrics and I looked over and the guy was like\""]
["02:09,780","02:21,780","\"Jeez I loved it. I sure loved Disney. What's wrong with Disney? They stink at the smell. Yeah\""]

["02:33,420","02:35,100","\"But evil Disney corrupted.\""]
["02:35,100","02:38,700","\"And bent him into a shape and monster.\""]
["02:38,700","02:43,300","\"Walt Disney rose from the grave to squeeze him and compress his back.\""]
["02:43,300","02:52,180","\"It was supposed to be the nicest film of our age, but they had to go and ruin it and make it scary.\""]
["02:52,180","02:54,180","\"Are you still fucking right with Tigger?\""]
