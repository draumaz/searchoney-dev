["17:36,400","17:44,800","\"Dude when I was like 17 a bunch of my friends got really into airsoft and I was like I'm I'm gonna get into it too\""]
["17:44,800","17:46,800","\"And I bought some airsoft gun\""]
["17:46,800","17:49,240","\"It was like why do I do this?\""]
["17:49,240","17:55,160","\"I wasn't into it at all. Yeah, I was gonna say I was in a similar thing, but my parents told me I couldn't get it and then\""]
["17:55,160","18:00,600","\"I wound up not caring like made my mom and dad bring me up to a weird airsoft store\""]
["18:01,360","18:06,460","\"We definitely had like big-ass air softwars like in the neighborhood streets for sure\""]
["18:06,460","18:11,760","\"But like they some of the younger kids kept like getting shot and like bitching about it to their parents\""]
["18:11,760","18:16,240","\"So it kind of had to like end. Yeah, I mean that makes sense. Yeah\""]
["18:16,240","18:26,400","\"They heard enough I remember we used to dig big giant pits in the sandbox at my housing complex when I was like six\""]

["18:28,160","18:33,920","\"Like parents would freak out and be like someone could fall into this hole and I'm my logic was just like well\""]
["18:33,920","18:35,920","\"It's still all sand so who cares\""]
["18:35,920","18:38,640","\"Also, they're gonna learn a lot if they fall into that hole\""]
["18:38,640","18:43,880","\"They'll learn more from falling into that hole than they would from avoiding pain for their whole life\""]
["18:43,880","18:49,800","\"That's how we build our forts is we we dig like a five foot deep hole in the sand box and then put like\""]
["18:49,800","18:51,680","\"shitty like\""]
["18:51,680","18:54,880","\"Broken down cardboard boxes on top as a roof. Yeah\""]
["18:55,360","19:01,400","\"And it was way way colder in our little forts than it was out in the Michigan Sun\""]
["19:01,400","19:05,440","\"There was these kids that live near me they used to have this well\""]
["19:05,440","19:09,480","\"They they all had airsoft's but they also they used to do this thing where they would uh\""]
["19:09,480","19:12,400","\"What do you call it when you boil a pot above water?\""]

["19:31,700","19:37,160","\"And then there was this woman who used to rock back and forth on her chair and they just shoot at her with these like boiling hot babies\""]
["19:37,160","19:41,240","\"And then she died\""]
["19:41,240","19:43,240","\"That's terrible. That's the most Irish story\""]
["19:43,240","19:51,200","\"Babies already hurt without putting them in boiling water. Yeah, they shot it into her eyes and she died. That's terrible\""]
