["10:14,740","10:18,140","\"He had like a gun pointed to his head or something and he's pissing himself.\""]
["10:18,140","10:23,580","\"I think that's one of the cutscenes from Worms Armageddon. Worms Armageddon was just Worms 2 right?\""]
["10:23,580","10:25,300","\"It was just like an expansion or something?\""]
["10:25,300","10:31,300","\"No, it's a different game. Worms 2 had the really weird 3D renders of them for cutscenes.\""]
