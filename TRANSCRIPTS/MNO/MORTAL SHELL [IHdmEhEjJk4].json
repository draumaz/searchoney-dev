["00:33,640","00:40,200","\"Ooh, it was just some quote just some bullshit. It was the entire crux of this game. Oh, that's floaty Jane\""]
["00:40,200","00:45,120","\"You better shut up. You better shut your mouth. I didn't say anything bad about her dude\""]
["00:45,120","00:52,800","\"I didn't say anything bad about her. I'm I was just saying she looks lonely, you know, that's you Chris. Is it really? Yeah, yeah\""]

["01:05,020","01:07,020","\"It looks pretty cool doesn't it?\""]
["01:07,020","01:12,580","\"I never expected like a soulsy game to have like sent the music. That's also cool. You're just like a faceless\""]
["01:12,580","01:15,900","\"husk\""]
["01:15,900","01:22,020","\"Yay, okay, there's a dodge like in bloodborne and if you double tap it, it's a roll. I think oh wow\""]
["01:23,100","01:26,100","\"Alrighty, I like the way this fucking weird guy looks.\""]
["01:26,100","01:28,100","\"They're about to teach you all the controls anyway.\""]
["01:28,100","01:29,100","\"Just go toward the lights.\""]
["01:29,100","01:30,100","\"Okay.\""]
["01:30,100","01:32,100","\"Yeah, you're spoiling it.\""]
["01:32,100","01:34,100","\"You're spoiling the controls, Tomar.\""]
["01:34,100","01:36,100","\"You're spoiling by controls.\""]
["01:36,100","01:38,100","\"Oh, you're teaching you the heart and mood.\""]
["01:38,100","01:39,100","\"Can I heart it?\""]
["01:39,100","01:42,100","\"Yeah, I know it's a huge part of the defense in this game.\""]
["01:42,100","01:43,100","\"And of being a romance.\""]
["01:43,100","01:45,100","\"This is what they have instead of blocking.\""]
["01:45,100","01:46,100","\"Alright.\""]
["01:46,100","01:48,100","\"But parrying is a totally different thing.\""]
["01:48,100","01:49,100","\"Whoa.\""]
["01:49,100","01:52,100","\"So you can actually hold that for a few seconds, but...\""]
["01:52,100","01:56,260","\"seconds, but then that thing in the bottom there it's recharged you can use it again\""]
["01:56,260","01:59,300","\"All right, there we go\""]
["01:59,300","02:09,020","\"Yeah, when you get hit heartened, I think you normally you take no damage and it usually stuns the other person attacking you\""]
["02:09,020","02:12,420","\"Ooh\""]
["02:12,420","02:14,540","\"That's a radical statue bro\""]

["02:30,180","02:34,260","\"The hallowed sword a heavy sword with a hollow at its center\""]
["02:34,260","02:41,940","\"Got the old classic controls everyone's used to yeah, maybe fake learn his patterns real quick\""]
["02:41,940","02:47,980","\"All right, and then there's a big a big boy\""]
["02:48,700","02:55,220","\"So Chris does with his fucking oh, I grabbed the grab the blade and smashed him with the pommel. That's kind of cool\""]
["02:55,220","03:00,900","\"What an idiot that's also dumb as shit. Yeah, what a twat? Yeah, it makes no sense, but it's cool\""]
["03:00,900","03:04,380","\"Not only when you probably hurt yourself and slip out of your hands though\""]
["03:04,380","03:11,500","\"Okay, you may harden in most even while attacking so the idea is in mid attack you can harden and then\""]
["03:11,500","03:17,180","\"You'll be invincible and then you'll still complete the attack. Oh like there Wow. Oh\""]
["03:18,140","03:20,140","\"Fuck no\""]
["03:20,140","03:27,060","\"You brute don't worry. You don't have health yet really yeah, you have a meter for it\""]
["03:27,060","03:33,360","\"Remember to be hard. Yeah, they want you to harden while you're in the middle of an attack\""]
["03:33,360","03:41,100","\"I'd see there you go. Okay. That's a pretty dominant strategy at the beginning of the game to do like a big heavy attack\""]
["03:41,100","03:45,780","\"Right as a guy's coming at you and then freeze and then let him attack and then\""]
["03:46,180","03:50,580","\"Okay, release the harden a little token got a little mortal token\""]
["03:50,580","03:53,420","\"My guy is so spooky. I\""]
["03:53,420","03:55,580","\"like this\""]

["04:03,500","04:08,200","\"I think there might be a extra little item over here. This looks like a pretentious commercial for something\""]
["04:08,200","04:11,060","\"Yeah, there it is ooh\""]
["04:11,060","04:14,660","\"Get another little token. Oh, yeah and left click it makes you run\""]
["04:14,660","04:22,900","\"Okay, oh I guess once you use the token it gives you an ability that converts here\""]
["04:22,900","04:27,100","\"That guy did that he's called off\""]
["04:27,100","04:30,800","\"He's got hardened - he shouldn't do that to me\""]
["04:30,800","04:34,060","\"Damage taken while hardened is converted to health\""]
["04:34,060","04:37,660","\"Okay\""]
["04:37,660","04:44,460","\"And I died like an idiot damage taken while not hardened is converted to damage. Don't worry. I don't think you're supposed to\""]
["04:44,460","04:52,140","\"win that fight. Oh that's the the lunch bell he's hungry he's got to leave. Oh\""]

["06:00,960","06:06,740","\"At least you can stop, but you can't go back. Oh, there's gravity all over\""]

["07:58,360","08:03,240","\"- I would recommend taking the most obvious path to start.\""]
["08:03,240","08:04,060","\"- Okay.\""]
["08:04,060","08:07,560","\"- Just based, I mean, you could fuck around with\""]

["08:11,280","08:12,360","\"- Oh yeah, that's right.\""]
["08:12,360","08:13,760","\"Yeah, this is how the game gives you\""]
["08:13,760","08:15,840","\"like kind of hints of where to go.\""]
["08:15,840","08:19,440","\"- That was the talisman of boggular sight.\""]
["08:20,760","08:24,600","\"Vlogular it lets you see every man within a five mile radius\""]
["08:24,600","08:29,960","\"So it's like it's pretty much saying go towards what we showed you yeah, that's exactly what it's saying\""]
["08:29,960","08:34,480","\"Wow, but first open this cool chest look you're loot you got a loot\""]
["08:34,480","08:38,760","\"Well, you keep that like a complete dick if you scroll to the right with your oh no\""]
["08:38,760","08:43,720","\"You could have just it's in your quick items and then just press it press it up\""]
["08:43,720","08:46,360","\"And it pays a different song each time\""]
["08:49,560","08:51,160","\"He sucks at it.\""]
["08:51,160","08:52,720","\"Well, practice makes perfect.\""]
["08:52,720","08:53,360","\"He's trying.\""]
["08:53,360","08:55,920","\"He's trying to get a one familiarity.\""]
["08:55,920","08:57,440","\"So do you get better every time?\""]
["08:57,440","08:59,280","\"Yeah, you do.\""]
["08:59,280","09:01,560","\"So I just keep using it over and over.\""]
["09:01,560","09:04,920","\"Yeah, so just move your joystick to stand up\""]
["09:04,920","09:06,320","\"and then try using it again.\""]
["09:06,320","09:07,640","\"I see.\""]
["09:07,640","09:08,840","\"See, and each time it'll give you\""]
["09:08,840","09:11,680","\"another little familiarity point.\""]
["09:11,680","09:12,440","\"Weird.\""]
["09:12,440","09:18,400","\"He's getting better.\""]
["09:18,400","09:20,520","\"You got pretty good pretty fast actually.\""]
["09:20,520","09:22,560","\"- You really learned some basic chords.\""]
["09:22,560","09:27,080","\"- Now if this guy dies and you become the squishy thing again,\""]
["09:27,080","09:28,560","\"can it still play guitar?\""]
["09:28,560","09:29,640","\"- Yeah. - I think you can.\""]
["09:29,640","09:30,480","\"- Okay.\""]
["09:30,480","09:32,480","\"- I think your familiarity is permanent.\""]
["09:32,480","09:34,920","\"- I wanna hear more improvement, dear God, please.\""]
["09:34,920","09:39,400","\"I bet he's gonna be at least competent now.\""]
["09:39,400","09:43,920","\"No, you suck, you fucking asshole.\""]
["09:43,920","09:45,040","\"Play something good.\""]

["09:50,040","09:52,040","\"I'm sick of this fucking guy.\""]
["09:52,040","09:53,040","\"Screw it.\""]
["09:53,040","09:54,040","\"Screw is looting.\""]
["09:54,040","10:00,040","\"We might as well just get to 10.\""]
["10:00,040","10:01,040","\"Okay.\""]
["10:01,040","10:06,040","\"He's starting to play like cool metal songs.\""]
["10:06,040","10:09,040","\"I was expecting to be shredding it there.\""]
["10:09,040","10:12,040","\"What a disappointment.\""]
["10:12,040","10:15,160","\"So what is getting the familiarity with that too?\""]
["10:15,160","10:16,840","\"- And how careful.\""]
["10:16,840","10:19,280","\"Okay, so doesn't that look pretty familiar already?\""]
["10:19,280","10:20,400","\"- Yeah.\""]
["10:20,400","10:21,800","\"- So yeah, they're just sort of hammering\""]
["10:21,800","10:23,800","\"the basic ideas into your head.\""]
["10:23,800","10:25,760","\"- Fair enough.\""]
["10:25,760","10:29,480","\"- But yeah, you might as well just go toward it.\""]
["10:29,480","10:32,080","\"- Go into the man.\""]
["10:32,080","10:32,920","\"- That's how it works.\""]
["10:32,920","10:36,400","\"- There's core gameplay-ish stuff you still wanna get there.\""]
["10:36,400","10:41,160","\"But take your time with these fellows.\""]
["10:41,160","10:43,640","\"They'll usually go down with three good hits.\""]
["10:43,640","10:45,660","\"Kick that guy's ass right now.\""]
["10:45,660","10:49,320","\"He doesn't even look tough.\""]
["10:49,320","10:50,160","\"- Yeah, fuck you.\""]
["10:50,160","10:51,840","\"- Look at those stupid little barriers.\""]
["10:51,840","10:54,600","\"- Don't forget about your cool harden ability.\""]

["11:32,480","11:33,880","\"- He stepped in the bear trap.\""]
["11:33,880","11:35,360","\"- I think he wanted you to step in that.\""]
["11:35,360","11:37,120","\"That was why he was taunting you.\""]
["11:37,120","11:38,680","\"Am I getting high?\""]

["11:50,560","11:56,760","\"try to take them one at a time. Okay, so you can harden but when you attack it\""]
["11:56,760","12:00,960","\"unharmed you right. Yeah, so what I suggest is start what the fuck I have\""]
["12:00,960","12:05,360","\"the attack and then harden in the middle of it. You see that? Yeah, he's fucking up.\""]
["12:05,360","12:08,240","\"He's got a bug on his shoe.\""]
