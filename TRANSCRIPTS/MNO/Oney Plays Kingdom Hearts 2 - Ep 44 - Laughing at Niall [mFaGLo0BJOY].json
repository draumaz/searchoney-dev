["06:28,560","06:37,800","\"My laugh is changing this year, it's fucked up.\""]
["06:37,800","06:38,880","\"It's hurting.\""]
["06:38,880","06:40,960","\"It's becoming more like old, like...\""]
["06:40,960","06:45,640","\"I have noticed that I cycle through laughter styles.\""]
["06:45,640","06:50,480","\"I, there was this time where consistently my friends,\""]
["06:50,480","06:53,360","\"My friends would say I had a prospector laugh.\""]
["06:53,360","06:55,200","\"(laughing)\""]

["06:58,440","07:00,120","\"It was very like, oh, I'm an old--\""]
["07:00,120","07:01,920","\"I definitely have a few different laughs.\""]
["07:01,920","07:04,000","\"You used to do that when I first moved in, Julian.\""]
["07:04,000","07:06,160","\"You go, (laughing)\""]
["07:06,160","07:07,160","\"you do stuff like that.\""]

["07:08,820","07:10,800","\"but that's just how it is.\""]
["07:10,800","07:11,920","\"Laughs do change.\""]
["07:11,920","07:14,500","\"Everything changes.\""]
["07:14,500","07:16,360","\"It's too bad because you wanna think of a laugh\""]
["07:16,360","07:18,640","\"as one of those things that's like a fingerprint,\""]
["07:18,640","07:20,160","\"like everybody has a unique one.\""]
["07:20,160","07:22,760","\"The hardest I've ever laughed, it didn't sound like me.\""]

["07:25,760","07:26,760","\"Uh-huh.\""]
["07:26,760","07:28,760","\"That was the hardest I've ever laughed, I think.\""]
["07:28,760","07:30,360","\"It doesn't even sound like me.\""]
["07:30,360","07:31,960","\"It sounded like a fucking chimpanzee.\""]
["07:31,960","07:34,960","\"Like, \"\"Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!\"\"\""]
["07:34,960","07:36,960","\"It's not like that, actually, at all.\""]
["07:36,960","07:38,160","\"No, it's funny, though.\""]
["07:38,160","07:39,760","\"I've made me smile.\""]
["07:39,760","07:41,760","\"If you listen to it, it's...\""]
["07:41,760","07:44,560","\"That is the most genuinely hard I've ever laughed.\""]

["08:02,360","08:03,360","\"*Laughter*\""]
["08:03,360","08:08,360","\"He fell, he smashed his face into the ground, and he fell over for no reason.\""]

["08:12,360","08:17,080","\"Chris, what if he happened to break all those bones when he fell and you were laughing at him?\""]
["08:17,080","08:21,960","\"Well, no the reason I laughed was because he got up and he said I don't even know what happened\""]
["08:21,960","08:28,400","\"It's full. He just looked at you. He looked confused. Chris, I'm doing a mathematical\""]
["08:28,400","08:32,480","\"What if you're pointing and laughing but he turns and looks at you and half of his face is coming on\""]
["08:32,480","08:37,360","\"Oh my god, I would probably laugh but out of shock like people that's why people laugh a lot of the time\""]
["08:37,360","08:41,880","\"It's true because they're confused after a big thing about laughter is that it dispels tension\""]
["08:41,880","08:46,340","\"It does you know it's a coping mechanism and then someone goes what is wrong with you?\""]
["08:46,340","08:52,020","\"I've seen situations where horrible things happen and people laugh and it's like what the fuck are you doing?\""]
["08:52,020","08:55,140","\"But it's just normal because they're just like coping with it. I\""]
["08:55,140","08:59,760","\"Mean sometimes you need to also be able to laugh at that stuff to get over things that happen\""]
["08:59,760","09:06,260","\"But I mean in the heat of the moment, it's really weird to see someone laugh at something horrible in the heat of the moment\""]
["09:06,260","09:09,100","\"It's very weird for someone to spontaneously fall. I agree\""]
["09:09,100","09:17,740","\"It sounds like Rita repulsed every time he does that. I love that\""]
["09:17,740","09:25,100","\"We watched the Para Rangers movie we did I like that movie even though it's stupid\""]
["09:25,100","09:28,980","\"It's very stupid, but Ivan who's is a lot of fun. Ivan who's is a lot of fun\""]
["09:28,980","09:33,420","\"He's probably one of the coolest looking villains ever. He's a goofball. He's really scary\""]
["09:33,420","09:36,580","\"I wish there was a goof themed villain. That's fun\""]
["09:37,340","09:40,540","\"I was thinking about when they rebooted the Power Rangers movie.\""]

["09:43,140","09:44,340","\"He's so cool.\""]
["09:44,340","09:45,840","\"By the way, that happened.\""]
["09:45,840","09:47,340","\"Everybody forgot that happened.\""]
["09:47,340","09:49,140","\"It's because they didn't do anything cool with it.\""]
["09:49,140","09:50,140","\"They just didn't do anything with it.\""]
["09:50,140","09:51,140","\"They made it bland.\""]

["10:12,240","10:16,960","\"That's another thing. Can we talk about the sonic fucking poster that came out today?\""]
["10:16,960","10:21,500","\"How do you take? We had a feeling you were gonna bring a little time. I'm not mad at that one.\""]
["10:21,500","10:27,960","\"That one is so stupid to me that I'm going to laugh at. I got really mad at Ding Dong because he was trying to show me the poster\""]
["10:27,960","10:32,360","\"Sonic and I was like I don't want to be part of this discussion. This entire thing is stupid\""]
["10:33,880","10:38,920","\"Like you know, it's oh the marketing is now like oh, let's talk about whether or not it's bad\""]
["10:38,920","10:42,580","\"Yeah, I don't want to be part of it. Yeah, that's a good boy. I can't reach this thing\""]
["10:42,580","10:44,960","\"and\""]
["10:44,960","10:50,280","\"I got really mad at him for trying to show me but then I saw it on my own on accident and I started laughing\""]
["10:50,280","10:52,800","\"Really hard. I\""]
["10:52,800","10:59,120","\"Why does he have like a human body? Why weird the big thing for me is the civil way you can clearly see there's an eye\""]

["11:22,780","11:24,780","\"Side it fucking\""]
["11:24,780","11:32,020","\"I'm coming now! Why you squeezing your cat? Listen, are you listening? I'm listening. If you take an eyeball, it's not a perfect sphere.\""]
["11:32,020","11:41,740","\"It actually does come out further than a sphere would. Chris, I'm just trying to exaggerate a conversation. I know. I know babe. I know babe. I'm sorry babe. But listen, all I'm saying is...\""]
["11:41,740","11:52,700","\"Uh-huh, you're wrong. No, oh no, all I'm saying is... I don't know what we're saying because I already... That's wrong. I threw away the whole... The side of the design that they showed, right? Uh-huh.\""]
["11:52,700","11:59,020","\"I would actually laugh and respect it if it was so fucking stupid and fake that they did that just for the poster\""]
["11:59,020","12:02,180","\"Just to get people talking about it. It could be then I would be like, okay, okay\""]
["12:02,180","12:05,440","\"Can I ask you this man? Yeah, why was it with detected Pikachu?\""]
["12:05,440","12:07,560","\"You were having fun smiling at how stupid it looked\""]
["12:07,560","12:09,780","\"But you couldn't do it with the sonic one because I could do it with both\""]
["12:09,780","12:15,760","\"I think they're both really dumb the only reason is because Sonic has already had a bunch of stupid shit and no one takes it seriously\""]
["12:15,760","12:16,140","\"Yeah\""]
["12:16,140","12:22,580","\"And I want them to take it like a little I wanted to just respect that Sonic is a cool franchise because I like the aesthetic that\""]
["12:22,580","12:25,700","\"all of the Sega games had and the world that they had. I thought it was cool.\""]
["12:25,700","12:30,340","\"-Sondlyx also been a really experimental franchise that I always pass it off to different people.\""]
["12:30,340","12:34,740","\"And people who like it or people who don't like it, no one seems to even know what it is anymore\""]
["12:34,740","12:38,500","\"because I would say they were about the physics, but people always say it was about the speed.\""]
["12:38,500","12:41,300","\"But then when they get the speed, they would say it was about something different,\""]
["12:41,300","12:45,300","\"that it was the characters that were the problem. -No, yeah. -It's like the worst thing in the world to\""]
["12:45,300","12:49,300","\"work on, that for each other. -So it's been through so many permutations that you couldn't really come\""]
["12:49,300","12:52,460","\"up with like a singular identity for it anymore.\""]
["12:52,460","12:53,300","\"- And even if you do--\""]
["12:53,300","12:55,100","\"- Unless you're going back to those core three games.\""]
["12:55,100","12:56,460","\"- And even if you do that,\""]
["12:56,460","12:58,700","\"'cause Mania came out and was good, even that people--\""]
["12:58,700","13:01,140","\"- Even that personally, I think the original aesthetic\""]
["13:01,140","13:03,500","\"is a mess, like they're like\""]
["13:03,500","13:06,180","\"rubber-hose 30s cartoons, but like everything is--\""]
["13:06,180","13:07,020","\"- I love it.\""]
["13:07,020","13:08,020","\"- Yeah, I have no issue in how it looks.\""]
["13:08,020","13:08,860","\"I like the look at the look at the look.\""]
["13:08,860","13:09,900","\"- I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying\""]
["13:09,900","13:11,020","\"it's incredibly confused.\""]
["13:11,020","13:14,060","\"- I think Sonic's classic design is fucking marvelous.\""]
["13:14,060","13:15,420","\"I think it's beautiful.\""]
["13:15,420","13:17,780","\"- I really, the OVA design they had for them,\""]
["13:17,780","13:18,620","\"I really like it.\""]
["13:18,620","13:23,260","\"one I'm talking about but uh that was the thing with mania even it was getting some people who\""]
["13:23,260","13:27,820","\"were just still like oh but it belongs to this property so whatever you know just shit on it\""]
["13:27,820","13:31,580","\"and then it's kind of a bummer because it's like yeah they're never gonna be able to do\""]
["13:31,580","13:35,900","\"anything with it period ever never ever ever it's a doomed franchise you could do the best\""]
["13:35,900","13:40,780","\"things in the world and it's still just gonna kind of get put down because of its reputation so\""]
["13:40,780","13:45,820","\"yeah getting a shitty film I'm not surprised that's the only reason I was kind of like I wish they\""]
["13:45,820","13:51,940","\"They had it just done a good movie one good movie, but I know it's gonna be the most embarrassing thing in the world\""]
["13:51,940","13:57,340","\"And it'll probably be really funny. Yeah, that's true and so that it'll be like funny. I mean consider the sonic fan film\""]
["13:57,340","14:02,540","\"That's another thing I think we got excited for that one. Hey, no, that's the other thing\""]
["14:02,540","14:08,980","\"That's the first thing I thought was this looks worse than sonic fan film like if I want to laugh at something cringy\""]
["14:08,980","14:13,340","\"I got sonic fan film I wanted this to be like something good. That's all that's the only thing\""]
["14:13,340","14:19,120","\"What if you saw the trailer for it and it was like the Super Mario movie would you feel better because you're going off of just a\""]
["14:19,120","14:22,720","\"Rendered off the wall. Yes, completely ridiculous\""]
["14:22,720","14:26,160","\"If it has live action people, I mean it's sonic come on think about it\""]
["14:26,160","14:29,480","\"If you have live action people interacting with Sonic the hedgehog in the real world\""]
["14:29,480","14:33,440","\"Which is probably what they're gonna do. Yeah, I could see them taking it in direction\""]
["14:33,440","14:39,320","\"Where it could be the stupidest thing and just be really funny because of it. Yeah, but it probably will just be a boring direction\""]
["14:39,320","14:41,320","\"is what I would say\""]
["14:41,320","14:45,240","\"Honestly Detective Pikachu might go down a boring route too. I'm hoping it'll just be stupid\""]
["14:45,240","14:52,800","\"That's another thing like name good video game movies. There aren't any most most of them aren't even so bad\""]
["14:52,800","14:56,040","\"They're funny most of them are just boring. So that's what I'm expecting this to be\""]
["14:56,040","14:59,120","\"That's what I would say is the term to some of the ones that are so bad. They're funny\""]
["14:59,120","15:02,060","\"Is that at least they're really entertaining? Yeah, but there's not enough of those\""]
["15:02,060","15:08,040","\"We just watched you watch Street Fighter and you said I love the Street Fighter movie that was really fun and entertaining\""]
["15:08,040","15:10,960","\"Yeah, it's ridiculous. I've never seen that actually\""]
["15:10,960","15:15,820","\"Oh my god not said he's my favorite why he's at them\""]
["15:15,820","15:26,040","\"It's my theme true probably the coolest song the song tray\""]
["15:26,040","15:31,320","\"That was him on his guard\""]
["15:31,320","15:37,780","\"Look he's on his guard. I'm sorry. He did not put out the computer fire. Sorry for being a negative Nazi about\""]
["15:37,780","15:43,460","\"Oh, you're not I'm just saying like I just I really I just wish they would make it. Oh, I know\""]
["15:43,460","15:47,460","\"I'm just saying though with Sonic in general. I know it's never gonna reach anything again\""]
["15:47,460","15:51,140","\"Because it's just not gonna be allowed to you know what that's what more of it is to me\""]
["15:51,140","15:55,700","\"I wish there was more good Sonic content than bad Sonic only receives negative reinforcement\""]
["15:55,700","15:58,900","\"And that's the only reason a lot of people even follow it\""]
["15:58,900","16:04,900","\"I mean you have people who will play those games and like pretend to be invested just because I do love those\""]
["16:05,460","16:12,380","\"Like for the kind of scary robot Nick aesthetic like the scary overworld. Do you ever play Sonic's Spin's ball?\""]
["16:12,380","16:15,780","\"Yeah, I actually like that aesthetic. I had it on Game Gear I remember\""]
["16:15,780","16:21,740","\"That don't have the scariest like Saturday or Saturday and aesthetic. Remember that? Yeah, I like that\""]
["16:21,740","16:26,300","\"That's because that was Western develops. Oh my god. The menu music is really bad in that\""]
["16:26,300","16:31,560","\"I remember Sonic's been ball having a bad soundtrack. I like the first level music a lot\""]
["16:31,560","16:35,940","\"I think it actually sounds pretty good, but I remember the menu music is like it deafens you\""]
["16:35,940","16:40,560","\"I need to hear it again of editor play it right now. I could turn it off. That was bad. Oh my god\""]
["16:40,560","16:47,960","\"But yeah, no, that was a really good time in general for that series\""]
["16:47,960","16:53,320","\"I would say was like around Sonic 2 Sonic 3 sonic spin ball and all that after that\""]
["16:53,320","16:59,200","\"That's when they kind of fell off think of a game engine that you enjoy that you would throw at the sonic like graphics over\""]
["16:59,200","17:01,200","\"That would make it a good sonic game\""]
["17:01,200","17:08,800","\"I'll say this, even though it's kind of rough around the edges and you can kind of go either way with it\""]
["17:08,800","17:11,680","\"I know a lot of people like Sonic RoboBLAST 2\""]
["17:11,680","17:12,680","\"There were players?\""]
["17:12,680","17:17,520","\"That was a Doom mod that's been worked on for like, I don't even know how many years now 14, 15 years\""]
["17:17,520","17:20,480","\"And they're still working on it today\""]
["17:20,480","17:21,220","\"Really?\""]
["17:21,220","17:24,240","\"And it's just a 3d platformer in the Doom engine with Sonic\""]
["17:24,240","17:24,740","\"Wow\""]
["17:24,740","17:26,740","\"And they even have multiplayer\""]
["17:26,740","17:30,720","\"There's a fan project they just they showed a video for a little while ago\""]
["17:30,720","17:37,140","\"They're making like a cart racing thing based off of it now. So there's like a hundred tracks in the doom engine tied to it\""]
["17:37,140","17:41,060","\"Wow, you can do a lot with the doom engine. I know they're even doing\""]
["17:41,060","17:44,560","\"New official doom maps this winter apparently\""]
["17:44,560","17:48,040","\"Official ones. Yeah, that's cool\""]
["17:48,040","17:54,140","\"That's cool to see that if there's a game engine that I think is one of the most flexible Matt regard and still gets modded\""]
["17:54,140","17:57,780","\"Doom still has a really dedicated scene around it\""]
["17:57,780","18:00,980","\"And people still make the most like incredible things without it\""]
["18:00,980","18:10,220","\"That's cool to hear have you seen any do not I remember you showed me a really weird one when we first started talking\""]
["18:10,220","18:15,180","\"Which one I don't know I had like Simpsons graphics in it. I just show you Simpsons\""]
["18:15,180","18:21,380","\"There's cool ones though everyone talks about brutal doom\""]
["18:21,380","18:27,740","\"I remember there was one I saw with like all these magic abilities that came up with and you could like launch enemies into\""]
["18:27,740","18:30,900","\"to the air and then like chain moves together off of them.\""]
["18:30,900","18:32,660","\"It was actually really cool to see that.\""]
["18:32,660","18:37,980","\"Like a first person shooter where you launch enemies in the air and then do stuff to them.\""]
["18:37,980","18:40,860","\"Someone recreated Donkey Kong Country in it.\""]
["18:40,860","18:44,460","\"There's a lot of really neat stuff you can find.\""]
["18:44,460","18:45,460","\"You just have to look.\""]
["18:45,460","18:49,420","\"What was other shit we used to talk about when we first started talking?\""]
["18:49,420","18:51,420","\"I don't remember.\""]
["18:51,420","18:52,420","\"Really?\""]
["18:52,420","18:54,060","\"That was like five years ago.\""]
["18:54,060","18:55,060","\"Was it?\""]
["18:55,060","18:56,060","\"I think it was.\""]
["18:56,060","18:57,060","\"It couldn't have been five years ago.\""]
["18:57,060","19:00,260","\"like three years ago no it was when you guys first started talking it would\""]
["19:00,260","19:04,640","\"have had to have been quite a while ago really because I came out here almost\""]
["19:04,640","19:08,620","\"we've been on the show for almost three years are you fucking serious no I\""]
["19:08,620","19:13,540","\"think it's been like four to five years fuck I'm sorry I'm making that up is\""]
["19:13,540","19:18,540","\"that not true no that's about right to me that's scary to think I met you at\""]
["19:18,540","19:21,840","\"that Megfest for the first time but before that we were talking for a bit I\""]
