["00:09,080","00:10,260","\"False Station.\""]
["00:10,260","00:12,580","\"Chris' actual favorite game.\""]
["00:12,580","00:13,220","\"One of them.\""]
["00:13,220","00:16,860","\"And the server that we originally built together, which\""]
["00:16,860","00:20,060","\"is run graciously by Michael Swain.\""]
["00:20,060","00:20,560","\"Yes.\""]
["00:20,560","00:21,540","\"So I'm really new to all this.\""]
["00:21,540","00:21,940","\"I'm curious.\""]
["00:21,940","00:24,020","\"Why is there a Minecraft soap bar in the front?\""]
["00:24,020","00:25,900","\"What is that to do with it?\""]
["00:25,900","00:26,620","\"I made this--\""]
["00:26,620","00:27,820","\"Chris rendered all this.\""]
["00:27,820","00:32,680","\"I made this in blender a year or two ago. Are you sure because it looks like a screenshot out of Minecraft?\""]
["00:32,680","00:36,780","\"Well, you see Mick I took graphics from the game and I\""]
["00:36,780","00:41,300","\"Put you know extra fancy shit. It's beautiful\""]
["00:41,300","00:47,920","\"But anyways, yeah, this this game is about you're on a space station and you pick a job\""]
["00:47,920","00:50,980","\"Let's pick a job right now. My favorite job is the clown\""]
["00:50,980","00:55,480","\"Set occupation preferences. We definitely want to be the clown. Hi\""]
["00:56,180","01:01,120","\"Game preferences. Hopefully we can be the traitor very good. Okay, so\""]
["01:01,120","01:06,760","\"We're waiting for the round to start. This is a round base game. You said hopefully will be the traitor\""]
["01:06,760","01:12,340","\"How does that work? The game will just pick a random person to be the traitor and what the traitor is?\""]
["01:12,340","01:14,620","\"It's just a random person few people right? Oh, yeah\""]
["01:14,620","01:22,120","\"Yeah, so if you're the traitor, it'll give you objectives and it will say like you need to steal something you need to kill somebody\""]
["01:22,900","01:27,620","\"So wait, that's like playing clue, but there's like three possible killers in the room exactly yeah\""]
["01:27,620","01:35,660","\"So what's cool about that is it makes every round very paranoid? Yeah, you're out on your own looking out for your own neck, you know\""]
["01:35,660","01:42,220","\"So oh shit already something's going on oh no no it says that at the start of every round\""]
["01:42,220","01:46,340","\"Okay, it just doesn't make you it gets you invested you go shit. What's going down?\""]

["02:10,540","02:13,820","\"No, that's correct. All that stuff. So is that why you always pick the clown?\""]

["09:34,880","09:38,880","\"So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use my screwdriver on this little window.\""]

["09:49,840","09:51,200","\"- You check this out.\""]
["09:51,200","09:54,240","\"- Test-light is on, on.\""]
["09:54,240","09:56,360","\"- You just pulse lights until you see the emergency.\""]
["09:56,360","09:58,760","\"- Off, okay, we can hack it, okay, brown, we're good,\""]
["09:58,760","10:01,240","\"we can hack into security.\""]

["10:04,040","10:05,920","\"what he just tested out.\""]
["10:05,920","10:07,100","\"- It changes every round.\""]
["10:07,100","10:10,520","\"So sometimes you get a shock, sometimes you're a-okay.\""]
["10:10,520","10:12,640","\"We're gonna try and get this fucking bitch outta here.\""]
["10:12,640","10:14,060","\"So now what- what-\""]
["10:14,060","10:17,620","\"You go and you pulse the brown door and then while it's pulsed\""]
["10:17,620","10:20,400","\"You stick a crowbar in and you pry it-\""]
["10:20,400","10:20,900","\"Oh!\""]
["10:20,900","10:21,900","\"-fry it open, right?\""]

["10:25,000","10:28,000","\"All he saw was you walking up to a door.\""]
["10:28,000","10:30,600","\"Okay, I guess we're gonna try this in a different way.\""]
["10:30,600","10:31,440","\"Let's do this.\""]
["10:31,440","10:34,100","\"Would this take you into the vents?\""]
["10:34,100","10:35,380","\"Yeah, which is fine.\""]
