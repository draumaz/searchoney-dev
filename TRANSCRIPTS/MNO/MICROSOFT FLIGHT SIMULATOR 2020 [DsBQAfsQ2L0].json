["00:33,680","00:34,360","\"-Oh.\""]
["00:34,360","00:38,200","\"-Oh, the plane's just gonna evolve into a higher life form.\""]
["00:38,200","00:41,320","\"-They become that beautiful plane picture where she's looking back at the camera.\""]
["00:41,320","00:43,640","\"That's fucking real. Did you see that?\""]
["00:43,640","00:44,760","\"-It is.\""]

["02:05,760","02:09,760","\"Oh, it's just going to toss us right out into the sim.\""]
["02:09,760","02:11,760","\"I hope so.\""]

["02:28,000","02:29,880","\"- Satellite Bill Gates pours.\""]
["02:29,880","02:33,360","\"- I also hope you can resize the plane from large to small\""]
["02:33,360","02:36,460","\"and we can fly into one of Bill Gates's pours.\""]
["02:36,460","02:40,320","\"- Invade his body and make him do silly stuff.\""]

["02:58,200","03:00,200","\"- Oh, it has to call back to that other game.\""]
["03:00,200","03:02,200","\"- Oh my god. - It is inferior meatice.\""]
["03:02,200","03:04,600","\"Should we train first or just fucking do it?\""]
["03:04,600","03:09,360","\"- I think the best pilots in the world learned\""]

["04:24,560","04:27,800","\"- Yeah, where all of society is just sentient planes.\""]
["04:27,800","04:30,520","\"- Yeah, and the king plane is Dane Cook,\""]
["04:30,520","04:32,880","\"or as they call him in the film, \"\"Plane Cook.\"\"\""]
["04:32,880","04:34,920","\"(laughing)\""]

["04:38,680","04:41,120","\"flying a small airliner.\""]
["04:41,120","04:43,920","\"- Can I change, okay, Tomar,\""]
["04:43,920","04:45,920","\"You need to be the controls guy.\""]

["04:53,920","04:55,920","\"-Yeah, no, look it up.\""]
["04:55,920","04:57,920","\"I bet there's things you can do.\""]
["04:57,920","04:59,920","\"-All you need to know is what's throttle up.\""]
["04:59,920","05:01,920","\"-Basic controls.\""]
["05:01,920","05:04,920","\"-Just do what I would do behind the wheel of a plane.\""]
["05:04,920","05:05,920","\"-Zoom level.\""]
["05:05,920","05:09,920","\"-Flic the switches and the buttons till it moves.\""]

["05:11,920","05:16,080","\"We're gonna do this we're gonna get off the ground. It's just like elite danger\""]
["05:16,080","05:21,360","\"throttle f3 decrease f2 throttle cut f1 I would have never\""]
["05:21,360","05:27,080","\"Guess that in a million years f3 is your throttle. What do you know about planes? Look at that?\""]
["05:27,080","05:33,480","\"Yes throttle. Yes. Oh, I was gonna say how do you have it?\""]
["05:33,480","05:41,600","\"Fucking turn out you've got us a mouse. What's your joke? What is your stick? I don't know. Oh, you're gonna run out of\""]
["05:41,600","05:45,440","\"Maybe trick clicking and dragging oh wait am I doing it?\""]
["05:45,440","05:51,700","\"This is a simulator might take a long time to take off, you know no oh number eight\""]
["05:51,700","05:56,200","\"That's not it you fucking liar\""]
["05:56,200","06:03,800","\"Maybe on the number. Oh, I got it. Yeah. Oh, I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm a vet landing gear. Okay, press G. That's normal\""]
["06:03,800","06:08,800","\"Holy fuck dude gears. Yes. It's just like a real plane\""]
["06:09,320","06:12,160","\"Dude, I'm not very good at flying a real plane. It looks like\""]
["06:12,160","06:18,200","\"But look I'm doing it it would be easier with a real joy stick and I'll just screen you ugly fucking thing\""]
["06:18,200","06:22,880","\"You know, this is heinous like this is a oh retract flaps\""]
["06:22,880","06:28,580","\"I do think you'd like it better if if you we could get this working with the Xbox controller and at least you had a like a thumb\""]
["06:28,580","06:33,960","\"Joy stick listen. We've just got our flaps retracted buddy. Oh my god. Look at me go\""]
["06:33,960","06:37,040","\"No, I'm doing good. He's doing great\""]
["06:38,360","06:40,360","\"Yeah, we'll be in\""]
["06:40,360","06:47,320","\"That's scary. Why does it cut out like a fucking horror movie?\""]
["06:47,320","06:53,520","\"Animated exploding I wanted to see it's much\""]
["06:53,520","07:03,120","\"It's a Bill Gates quote we got to leave it in he said it before he made this game\""]
["07:04,720","07:08,560","\"Lyle why did you deny that shit dude? I didn't deny it\""]
["07:08,560","07:13,420","\"I'm just saying that they were fake from the start look. I'm gonna pull off so sweetly\""]
["07:13,420","07:16,080","\"Well, yeah, don't wait till you get more speed\""]
["07:16,080","07:18,960","\"70 knots when that hits 70. Oh\""]
["07:18,960","07:21,480","\"90\""]
["07:21,480","07:27,080","\"Area that's what I meant 90 knots. I'm gonna go off the frickin show. Oh, you know what?\""]
["07:27,080","07:32,600","\"I'm off the berry farm with this 70 seemed like enough that feels pretty good honestly\""]
["07:33,480","07:38,240","\"Okay, yeah, do you want it to take 38 hours to get to Philadelphia press left stick? Oh?\""]
["07:38,240","07:40,920","\"Did I do it? I thought I did it\""]
["07:40,920","07:45,000","\"Go in oh, it's really slow. Yeah\""]
["07:45,000","07:49,580","\"Nanding gear landing gear. So this is really Ireland, huh?\""]
["07:49,580","07:55,260","\"This is the real Ireland does this look like it? Do you recognize this place?\""]
["07:55,260","08:00,640","\"It's it's the place of your birth Chris retract flaps you got to press F5 oh\""]
["08:01,840","08:08,460","\"Here oh no, I can do that with left stick. Oh to increase speed during climb pitch the nose down\""]
["08:08,460","08:11,140","\"Wow, dude\""]
["08:11,140","08:18,080","\"That looks like Ireland dude. I really must admit I want to go to waxford. Where's waxford? Is there a world map?\""]
["08:18,080","08:20,640","\"Whoa, yeah, it looks like there's one there\""]
["08:20,640","08:25,800","\"There's no co-pilot to reduce speed and pitch the nose up slightly\""]
["08:26,320","08:30,620","\"It's weird that they don't let you have a co-pilot or do they oh god if you're online\""]
["08:30,620","08:36,500","\"Can you like online with a co-pilot that would be so cool? He gets a little fucking thing presses all the buttons with you\""]
["08:36,500","08:38,500","\"Oh, I can look at that map\""]
["08:38,500","08:44,500","\"Yeah, but are not crashed though. Oh shit. I I guarantee you if they did that like you you would have\""]
["08:44,500","08:48,680","\"I'm sure they're already our trade streamers who like just sit there and do like\""]
["08:48,680","08:53,200","\"32-hour flights and stuff definitely they are now anyway\""]
["08:53,880","08:59,000","\"This definitely looks like it would accurately take the fucking time to get from one place to the other\""]
["08:59,000","09:06,100","\"This is actually used to train pilots before they get in like a big expensive machine that kills people if you crash it\""]
["09:06,100","09:12,440","\"I think so I don't think exclusively, but I think some people do get the the gist of how to use a plane\""]
["09:12,440","09:15,920","\"Through this game. Oh dude. I think I'm doing it. Oh fuck wait\""]
["09:15,920","09:20,280","\"Where's the ground at those really tugging and out like that like those wacky little?\""]
["09:21,640","09:25,080","\"You can focus on a point of interest by pressing X X\""]
["09:25,080","09:27,600","\"Yeah\""]
["09:27,600","09:30,840","\"To reduce speed, okay. I'm I'm heading south right now. That's what I want to do\""]
["09:30,840","09:33,920","\"I'm just gonna hug did this coastline until I recognize it\""]
["09:33,920","09:38,400","\"Do you think you will recognize it? Yeah, I think so are we at full throttle?\""]
["09:38,400","09:41,280","\"Charlie's Angels\""]
["09:41,280","09:47,320","\"No, old throttle. I just met is the engine going as fast as it can. I don't know\""]
["09:47,320","09:50,200","\"Oh, you're running out of fuel really fast. Really? Where's that?\""]
["09:50,800","09:52,800","\"It says you're at 48 percent.\""]
["09:52,800","09:53,300","\"What?\""]
["09:53,300","09:55,100","\"How did that happen?\""]
["09:55,100","09:58,100","\"Maybe they only give you enough to, uh, get there though.\""]
["09:58,100","10:00,100","\"'Cause I know that that's a thing with planes.\""]
["10:00,100","10:02,100","\"One time I had a flight that was super late,\""]
["10:02,100","10:05,700","\"and they were like, \"\"The plane has too much fuel,\""]
["10:05,700","10:09,200","\"so we're flying around in circles above the airport\""]
["10:09,200","10:13,200","\"to burn fuel because we can't land with this much fuel.\"\"\""]
["10:13,200","10:14,200","\"Are you serious?\""]
["10:14,200","10:16,300","\"I mean, I think the person was lying,\""]
["10:16,300","10:18,300","\"and it sounds really not believable,\""]
["10:18,300","10:19,700","\"so I might not be,\""]
["10:19,700","10:21,700","\"But I know that that was what I was told.\""]
["10:21,700","10:23,220","\"- Wow. - Oh.\""]
["10:23,220","10:25,020","\"- Tomar, look, that's Dublin.\""]
["10:25,020","10:25,860","\"- That's Dublin.\""]
["10:25,860","10:26,900","\"- That's fly closer.\""]
["10:26,900","10:28,600","\"It sucks up being this high.\""]
["10:28,600","10:30,740","\"Oh shit.\""]
["10:30,740","10:33,500","\"- You're gonna cause an Irish 9/11 Chris.\""]
["10:33,500","10:36,140","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:36,140","10:37,380","\"I don't wanna do that.\""]
["10:37,380","10:41,500","\"- The Irish. - Oh shit.\""]
["10:41,500","10:42,540","\"Oh, over-speeding.\""]
["10:42,540","10:44,500","\"Okay, I'm stopping, I'm stopping, I'm sorry.\""]
["10:44,500","10:46,060","\"- Are you gonna get arrested?\""]
["10:46,060","10:47,300","\"Oh!\""]
["10:47,300","10:48,500","\"Oh, fuck off.\""]
["10:48,500","10:51,140","\"You ripped that plane to shreds.\""]
["10:51,140","10:52,580","\"That shit scares me.\""]
["10:52,580","10:57,380","\"That might be an actual thing because there's more like wind resistance and shit lower down.\""]
["10:57,380","11:00,380","\"So you can literally smash the plane just by doing that.\""]
["11:00,380","11:02,580","\"You're just smashing it into air.\""]
["11:02,580","11:04,740","\"Dude, real flying is so boring.\""]
["11:04,740","11:07,740","\"Yeah, if we're taking anything away from this, it's number one.\""]
["11:07,740","11:08,940","\"Real flying is boring.\""]
["11:08,940","11:15,220","\"And number two, those guys are really just like 20 miles an hour away from just killing you.\""]
["11:15,220","11:17,900","\"Dude, there has to be fun things we can do with this.\""]
["11:17,900","11:24,900","\"Assistance I don't think the goal of this game is fun. I think the goal of this game is to teach you that Bill Gates is a huge piece of shit\""]
