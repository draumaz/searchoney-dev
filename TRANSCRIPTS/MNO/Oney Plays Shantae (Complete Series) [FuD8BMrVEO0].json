["03:27,340","03:29,460","\"- I'm out of the loop with my Chante lore, I need some help.\""]
["03:29,460","03:31,980","\"- Okay, there's another guy who's trying to take over the town.\""]
["03:31,980","03:35,540","\"He's like the Baron, he's like the rich guy who owns all the robots.\""]
["03:35,540","03:38,500","\"He wants to turn the town into like an army ship.\""]

["04:57,540","05:09,360","\"You think do you think the genie was predicting the future or do you think it was modern times he was in\""]
["05:09,360","05:13,380","\"Um, do you think it's the future the genie new Elvis?\""]
["05:13,380","05:19,040","\"So I think you know honestly this 107 facts about Aladdin could definitely be on federator\""]

["05:22,240","05:26,860","\"If the genie knew about Elvis then what else did he know about hmm?\""]

["05:56,660","06:01,560","\"Yeah, that indicates when there's gonna be a death pit, which I think is actually a good idea in a game like this.\""]
["06:01,560","06:05,340","\"Because you never really know. It's cute. It suits the pirates.\""]
["06:05,340","06:11,780","\"Alright, I'm gonna fight the boss soon. Is that the boss? No, this is a safe spot.\""]

["32:28,200","32:29,400","\"I think you're right.\""]
["32:29,400","32:34,200","\"There, see, I have like double click-it, so stupid.\""]
["32:34,200","32:35,900","\"Much for that.\""]
["32:35,900","32:36,900","\"That frog's cool.\""]
["32:36,900","32:40,200","\"I think it's fucking cool for long.\""]
["32:40,200","32:41,100","\"For you.\""]
["32:41,100","32:41,600","\"Oh!\""]
["32:41,600","32:43,200","\"So why was it jumping that way?\""]
["32:43,200","32:44,200","\"How did that happen?\""]
["32:44,200","32:46,100","\"Why did he die like Mario?\""]
["32:46,100","32:54,100","\"This game has so many opportunities where you can see girls in half naked and like pecanis and shit.\""]
["32:54,100","32:55,100","\"Nice!\""]
["32:55,100","32:57,100","\"Do you think the creator likes hot girls?\""]
["32:57,100","32:59,100","\"He's got the right idea.\""]
["32:59,100","33:04,100","\"Don't you can slide into the water hole when there is no water hole.\""]

["33:17,300","33:19,100","\"Put fucking titties in your game.\""]
["33:19,100","33:22,600","\"Actually, Sega did do that with Rouge.\""]

["33:30,700","33:34,300","\"Remember the Xbox, uh, the original Xbox?\""]
["33:34,300","33:35,500","\"You could put emulators on it.\""]
["33:35,500","33:36,400","\"Did you ever do that?\""]

["34:09,600","34:13,440","\"I thought ahead I think that's why he's staying by her side he's waiting for\""]

["34:19,800","34:25,440","\"she's got a sweet outfit risky boots she looks like a little blue monkey though\""]

["34:30,800","34:34,280","\"wider in her head I like that though I think it's cute because she is huge look\""]
["34:34,280","34:40,040","\"at she is huge fucking like monkey elf ears huge monkey fit don't get cute so\""]
["34:40,040","34:43,320","\"basically her weapons got stolen she's like you have my weapons she's like\""]
["34:43,320","34:45,080","\"I don't know what you're talking about,\""]
["34:45,080","34:47,160","\"because what actually happened was,\""]
["34:47,160","34:48,920","\"they released the pirate's curse.\""]
["34:48,920","34:52,540","\"The pirate curse took all the weapons,\""]
["34:52,540","34:54,280","\"and she's like, my men are missing,\""]
["34:54,280","34:57,600","\"and the men are infected with this thing,\""]
["34:57,600","34:59,040","\"which is like the darkness or something,\""]
["34:59,040","35:00,920","\"and you have to fight them and take them out of it.\""]
["35:00,920","35:04,280","\"So you have to collect about eight of them in each level.\""]
["35:04,280","35:06,120","\"I know where most of them are,\""]
["35:06,120","35:08,720","\"but you don't need most of them, you only need a few.\""]
["35:08,720","35:10,840","\"- We're glad for about how they did the backgrounds.\""]
["35:10,840","35:11,680","\"- Yeah.\""]
["35:11,680","35:14,400","\"Looks like they drew them high res and then shrunk them down.\""]
["35:14,400","35:15,680","\"I think that's what they did do.\""]
["35:15,680","35:17,200","\"It looks like it. Looks good though.\""]
["35:17,200","35:19,920","\"Like look at this transformation.\""]
["35:19,920","35:23,120","\"I'm gonna scream.\""]
["35:23,120","35:24,800","\"It's a cackle bat.\""]
["35:24,800","35:26,560","\"Yeah. See it's like a darkness creature.\""]
["35:26,560","35:29,440","\"She knows about it because she remembers her pirate master.\""]
["35:29,440","35:32,400","\"She basically has a master and that's a lot of this story.\""]
["35:32,400","35:36,160","\"You gonna fight this guy now?\""]
["35:36,160","35:37,360","\"Yeah, he's really easy though.\""]
["35:37,360","35:39,840","\"He just like does one the same move.\""]
["35:40,640","35:42,640","\"What in that purple bitch is making you do it? Why?\""]
["35:42,640","35:51,880","\"Because she wants Mike she wants her tinker bat back or whatever\""]
["35:51,880","35:59,760","\"You know what they're called but her little fucking those explosions were fine looking and her doing that shit again\""]
["35:59,760","36:03,800","\"What are doing that? Look at that? This is pixelation on that lamp\""]
["36:03,800","36:10,240","\"It's ridiculous. I don't get why they're do certain effects like why don't they just use pixels\""]
["36:10,240","36:15,620","\"I don't know but that effect looks like something straight out of like the n64 game of fucking like Mario Party\""]
["36:15,620","36:17,620","\"Yeah, it's like so unfitting\""]
["36:17,620","36:19,540","\"um\""]
["36:19,540","36:20,180","\"Oh\""]
["36:20,180","36:22,260","\"Yeah, the lamp. How do we use it?\""]
["36:22,260","36:28,180","\"There we go. Okay, so you got to collect the dust. I don't understand because the pixel art's so good\""]
["36:28,180","36:30,740","\"It's weird. I don't know either\""]
["36:30,740","36:35,380","\"So you have to collect all so essentially the game is you have to collect the dark magic\""]
["36:35,380","36:38,540","\"you don't need all of it you need some of it to get to the prince and\""]
["36:39,660","36:43,040","\"It's kind of like Metroidvania where it's like roguelike and stuff.\""]
["36:43,040","36:43,540","\"Hmm.\""]
["36:43,540","36:45,040","\"I like that stuff.\""]
["36:45,040","36:46,780","\"Sorry I'm skipping all the dialogue.\""]
["36:46,780","36:49,900","\"Metroidvania really cared too much because I kind of know it.\""]
["36:49,900","36:53,060","\"If you're off on the hook so get lost.\""]
["36:53,060","36:55,380","\"Pirates Master Guy sounds pretty dangerous.\""]
["36:55,380","36:56,380","\"Dangerous.\""]
["36:56,380","36:58,980","\"He was the greatest threat Sequin Land has ever known.\""]
["36:58,980","37:03,340","\"So she's talking about the pirate guy that I just ad-libbed real quickly.\""]
["37:03,340","37:05,860","\"It's not really that interesting.\""]
["37:05,860","37:06,860","\"Sorry.\""]
["37:06,860","37:08,660","\"I can't get engrossed in text boxes.\""]
["37:08,660","37:16,620","\"Feel like I'm playing a fucking RPG maker game. I feel you it's like I don't really give a shit. Okay, sorry. I know okay, so\""]
["37:16,620","37:20,220","\"Now look there he is his clamps\""]
["37:20,220","37:25,220","\"It's cool clamps. I forget what's in here. Oh, yeah, it's a chick\""]
["37:25,220","37:32,620","\"Well, I can come in here later, and there's gonna be an egg here. Yeah, and then that's what I need or I can I think I can talk to her\""]
["37:33,140","37:37,420","\"Yeah, talk to her right now. No, I don't even talk right now because it's what's kind of cool about this is it has like\""]
["37:37,420","37:40,180","\"Sequential stories. Mm-hmm. You can catch like\""]
["37:40,180","37:44,460","\"Glimps of different stories gimps. Yeah, I don't know I can't talk\""]
["37:44,460","37:48,540","\"This is a healthful you can come in here and refresh yourself anytime you get full health. Oh cool\""]
["37:48,540","37:54,260","\"You also go to the store and the stores are very important here is another really important thing\""]
["37:54,260","37:58,980","\"There's these things called heart squids. You can turn them into her and\""]
["37:59,700","38:04,120","\"She turns them into health she puts all four of them together and smash them together and makes them a heart for you\""]
["38:04,120","38:06,460","\"And you find them in dungeons and all over the place\""]
["38:06,460","38:09,920","\"That's cool all these characters have like little hot pixel bodies\""]
["38:09,920","38:15,380","\"It's I'm gonna need to take a break and go to the bathroom soon. What you gonna wash your hands\""]
["38:15,380","38:18,300","\"Wash more than that. So\""]
["38:18,300","38:22,340","\"Wait, so\""]
["38:22,340","38:27,660","\"You want this stuff. Oh my god. It's so ugly because it upgrades your your hat attack\""]
["38:27,700","38:32,580","\"It's very important to get that they have like five people in charge of the fucking graphics\""]
["38:32,580","38:36,860","\"You do look how fast I attack now. Oh cool\""]
["38:36,860","38:39,500","\"So I even have like little like\""]
["38:39,500","38:44,160","\"Little bit of a delay and stuff seems like some of the more important environments\""]
["38:44,160","38:47,980","\"They actually did pixel art. Okay. Yeah, like see the bricks in the wall there\""]
["38:47,980","38:53,340","\"Yeah, it seems like they didn't put a filter on that they actually did it like pixel by pixel and then in here\""]
["38:53,340","38:57,060","\"They draw actual backgrounds. They shrink it down save time. Yeah\""]
["38:57,060","39:02,660","\"That's cool. I need to go to the library to get a library card. What I actually need is\""]
["39:02,660","39:10,020","\"the talk to the old man or something like that. Maybe I could just talk to the... I think I gotta\""]
["39:10,020","39:13,300","\"talk to the owl lady. If not, then I have to go all the way back to my place and I think my\""]
["39:13,300","39:18,660","\"uncle will be there and I have to talk to him. What the fuck did I just step on? Uh, she ate.\""]
["39:18,660","39:23,380","\"That was weird. I like went through it. I'll just talk to her and see if anything comes up.\""]
["39:23,380","39:25,380","\"Yeah, I think she gives me a library card.\""]
["39:25,380","39:27,380","\"Hmm. Yeah. We're good.\""]
["39:27,380","39:29,380","\"What does her pirate do?\""]
["39:29,380","39:31,380","\"It's like...\""]
["39:31,380","39:35,380","\"I forget. I don't even know if it's... I think it's just like there? I don't know.\""]
["39:35,380","39:37,380","\"Do he squawk?\""]
["39:37,380","39:39,380","\"I don't remember it actually doing anything.\""]
["39:39,380","39:40,380","\"Okay.\""]
["39:40,380","39:42,380","\"Well, this game's gay, turn it off.\""]
["39:42,380","39:43,380","\"Alright.\""]
["39:43,380","39:45,380","\"The part don't do nothing.\""]
["39:45,380","39:49,380","\"I got the library card to Chris. I'm getting somewhere. Are you sure you don't return it off?\""]
["39:49,380","39:50,380","\"It's gay, I mean...\""]
["39:50,380","39:55,980","\"The only thing I don't like is I don't like how you have to do this every single fucking time you come back here.\""]
["39:55,980","40:02,980","\"I mean you get a run later on which lets you charge through everything but it's still like you have to come through here and do all this shit.\""]
["40:02,980","40:05,980","\"It's like you wish you could just teleport there quickly.\""]
["40:05,980","40:09,100","\"But this is like a part of the level so this is like...\""]
["40:09,100","40:11,580","\"This is like enemies and shit.\""]
["40:11,580","40:17,020","\"Inside of like a world map. It's like you know when you go to a hub world you feel like you want to be safe there.\""]
["40:17,180","40:21,180","\"You don't go out of the hub world and suddenly enemies are throwing shit at you when you leave the town.\""]
["40:21,180","40:25,180","\"I'm still basically in the hub world. This is still the hub world.\""]
["40:25,180","40:29,180","\"So I don't know why they do this. This is like, I guess it's to teach you how to attack and stuff.\""]
["40:29,180","40:33,180","\"But it's like you have to do this every single fucking time.\""]
["40:33,180","40:38,180","\"When you get stronger and you come back, you feel like more badass that you got stronger and you can blast through it quicker.\""]
["40:38,180","40:42,180","\"Yeah, essentially. But it's still like really annoying to begin with.\""]
["40:42,180","40:44,020","\"Like okay, I'm gonna come through here, right?\""]
["40:44,020","40:46,820","\"And then I have to come through here again after I come through here already\""]
["40:46,820","40:50,480","\"I mean if they mix it up with the enemies it wouldn't be so bad. Yeah, there's a lot of this\""]
["40:50,480","40:51,980","\"Just really go\""]
["40:51,980","40:55,580","\"I don't think anything yet. I\""]
["40:55,580","40:58,380","\"Can't get that because I need the hat\""]
["40:58,380","41:01,140","\"What kind of hat we talk there's a safe guy\""]
["41:01,140","41:06,100","\"Where did you go? There you go. So that's what I mean where it's like I'm still basically in town\""]
["41:06,100","41:09,460","\"But now I'm going to like fucking library or something. Hmm. Okay\""]
["41:10,300","41:13,980","\"Anglophores, so yeah, I feel the forest too. I got about that\""]
["41:13,980","41:20,680","\"Jesus I love how they fucking explode\""]
["41:20,680","41:27,160","\"The bento box are like full health. They're so fucking important. Why did that guy explode like that? No one else did\""]
["41:27,160","41:35,300","\"I don't know. It's a good question. You part of some kind of the music in this game is also really good. Yeah, really cool so far\""]
["41:35,300","41:39,700","\"What about the boxes do it's like full health\""]
["41:39,700","41:43,740","\"You get more hearts because I'm gonna kill the squids. Oh, okay\""]
["41:43,740","41:46,800","\"But they want you to beat the game without killing any\""]
["41:46,800","41:51,640","\"Squid thing and that's essentially I think four hearts total\""]
["41:51,640","41:55,540","\"Is all you get for the entire game, and it's really fucking hard\""]
["41:55,540","42:02,340","\"Oh really squid up there. So do you get like half hearts or what you get like a full heart if you turn a certain amount\""]
["42:02,340","42:08,820","\"I think you turn in four squids you get one heart. Oh and then I think just like yeah, it's like 24\""]
["42:08,820","42:10,820","\"Oh, it's a Swiss total.\""]
["42:10,820","42:12,820","\"So you get an extra four. You get like six?\""]

["42:14,820","42:16,820","\"Cool.\""]

["43:34,060","43:35,660","\"It was where you turn into animals.\""]
["43:35,660","43:36,860","\"It was for Game Boy?\""]
["43:36,860","43:37,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["43:37,860","43:38,860","\"That was it.\""]
["43:38,860","43:42,260","\"So I got to get flesh pops.\""]
["43:42,260","43:44,260","\"Oh, that's how I knew.\""]
["43:44,260","43:46,260","\"Some call me Johnny was talking about it.\""]
["43:46,260","43:47,860","\"Yeah, he said this was his favorite one.\""]
["43:47,860","43:48,860","\"Oh, really?\""]
["43:48,860","43:49,860","\"I can agree.\""]
["43:49,860","43:50,860","\"This is probably one of the best chanteas easily.\""]
["43:50,860","43:52,780","\"The other ones take too long.\""]
["43:52,780","43:56,260","\"Like you're doing your little dance and you take like 40 years to turn into a monkey.\""]
["43:56,260","43:57,260","\"It's really annoying.\""]
["43:57,260","43:59,660","\"I love his videos for background noise.\""]
["43:59,660","44:04,860","\"Yeah, he's really pretty much what I use YouTube videos specifically for background noise.\""]
["44:04,860","44:09,660","\"Me too. I think I have enough fleshy pops.\""]
["44:09,660","44:14,220","\"Very good guys. Whoa you got another one. Yeah.\""]
["44:14,220","44:19,660","\"I want to have a health thing soon. I think I have three.\""]
["44:19,660","44:23,740","\"I gotta kill that little snake.\""]
["44:23,740","44:29,580","\"Shit. Look at him go.\""]
["44:29,580","44:32,700","\"I always study at hands because of the way the graphic thing is.\""]
["44:32,700","44:35,700","\"It was like this little bit of green that makes it look like he has these little hands.\""]
["44:35,700","44:37,700","\"He's a bit of a cutie.\""]
["44:37,700","44:38,960","\"What's that?\""]
["44:38,960","44:40,000","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["44:40,000","44:40,900","\"I need a...\""]
["44:40,900","44:45,800","\"I get her shoot thing and it opens the eye, which lets me get the chest.\""]
["44:45,800","44:46,500","\"That's an eyeball?\""]
["44:46,500","44:47,200","\"Oh, that's a chest.\""]
["44:47,200","44:49,100","\"Yeah, I can't get the chest yet.\""]
["44:49,100","44:51,100","\"Huyo!\""]
["44:51,100","44:53,100","\"It's a secret and a quicker way to get there.\""]
["44:53,100","44:55,400","\"I have to take the old route.\""]
["44:55,400","44:56,900","\"I can't go quicker.\""]
["44:56,900","44:58,500","\"So I have to come up here instead.\""]
["44:58,500","45:00,000","\"But I have fleshy pops.\""]
["45:00,000","45:01,200","\"I think I have enough.\""]
["45:01,200","45:02,000","\"What do they do?\""]
["45:02,000","45:06,000","\"He's gonna give me like some access thing so I can go inside\""]
["45:06,000","45:09,000","\"and that's what pretty much starts the quest.\""]
["45:09,000","45:13,000","\"I got the Royal Key, see that's what I needed so I can go into the library now, I won't be bothered.\""]
["45:13,000","45:15,000","\"I don't know if Astroboo.\""]
["45:15,000","45:19,000","\"Oh yeah, he wants to get me his vacation brochure.\""]
["45:19,000","45:25,000","\"Yeah, Astroboo I came out on the Game Boy Advance and it was like a really good game and it came out on the PS2\""]
["45:25,000","45:29,000","\"and it was like really bad game so nobody played the Game Boy Advance version really.\""]
["45:29,000","45:35,000","\"Do you remember the fucking Astro Boy movie that had Nicholas Cage as his dad?\""]
["45:35,000","45:36,680","\"That was around the time the game came out I think.\""]
["45:36,680","45:40,760","\"Oh my god, he was such a terrible dad voice actor.\""]
["45:40,760","45:45,920","\"Like Nicholas Cage can sometimes act, but when he doesn't try, he can not try.\""]
["45:45,920","45:51,640","\"There's this scene when he's in a room with his son and he's like, or with the boy,\""]
["45:51,640","45:56,440","\"he's like, 'cause like what happens is like there's this freak accident and he has to\""]
["45:56,440","45:58,760","\"turn him into a robot like Mega Man and stuff.\""]
["45:58,760","46:03,280","\"And he's like, you're not, you're not really my son.\""]
["46:03,280","46:04,640","\"He didn't really look distressed at all.\""]
["46:04,640","46:08,720","\"He just sort of looked like he was in an uncomfortable situation.\""]
["46:08,720","46:10,120","\"He's supposed to look distraught.\""]
["46:10,120","46:12,360","\"He was a fucking son died and turned into a robot,\""]
["46:12,360","46:14,000","\"but it didn't look distraught at all.\""]
["46:14,000","46:15,440","\"- I never could.\""]
["46:15,440","46:16,280","\"Goodbye.\""]
