["00:57,280","00:58,280","\"Oh, does she?\""]
["00:58,280","01:02,440","\"When journalists reviewed this game, they said they were pissed off there's no fast travel,\""]
["01:02,440","01:05,840","\"but you need to get this cyclone fast travel to get the item to beat the game.\""]
["01:05,840","01:06,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:06,340","01:07,520","\"So were those homos talking about?\""]
["01:07,520","01:08,120","\"They're wrong.\""]
["01:08,120","01:10,480","\"There was absolutely fast travel in this game.\""]
["01:10,480","01:12,760","\"Anyone who said there wasn't fast travel didn't play the game.\""]
["01:12,760","01:14,160","\"Oh, she's a little one.\""]
["01:14,160","01:18,720","\"Or maybe they're just too stupid to not realize that they could fucking beat the cyclone guy.\""]
["01:18,720","01:20,280","\"She has her own theme song too.\""]
["01:20,280","01:22,480","\"Greetings, child.\""]
["01:22,480","01:24,880","\"I always love the fairy music.\""]
["01:24,880","01:26,040","\"It's very beautiful.\""]
["01:26,040","01:27,380","\"She's the first fairy.\""]
["01:27,380","01:29,520","\"An idiot.\""]
["01:29,520","01:32,220","\"She's not even clenching her hand to hold that thing.\""]
["01:32,220","01:32,940","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:32,940","01:35,180","\"She's a beautiful one, anybody.\""]
["01:35,180","01:38,820","\"You're right, Corey.\""]
["01:38,820","01:41,660","\"That is the they did use that for this Skyward Sword.\""]
["01:41,660","01:43,100","\"It's like sword.\""]
["01:43,100","01:43,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:43,620","01:46,760","\"That I think that's because this game is supposed to be.\""]
["01:46,760","01:51,560","\"Skyward Sword is supposed to take place in the future.\""]
["01:51,560","01:53,500","\"Above everything.\""]
["01:53,500","01:55,800","\"This this definitely takes place after Ocarina of Time.\""]
["01:55,800","02:02,540","\"That's what they endlessly like and hamfistedly hint at constantly. Yeah, absolutely. They give you both at the same time. That's so cool\""]
["02:02,540","02:05,320","\"Oh, you got fire nice. Yeah, nice\""]
["02:05,320","02:08,440","\"Fire nice\""]

["02:12,600","02:17,160","\"That's cool though that does look cool I\""]
["02:17,160","02:23,320","\"Think that's probably a better concept if I'm being honest just get the fucking ice and fire fair at the same time I\""]
["02:24,240","02:25,840","\"I remember in uh...\""]
["02:25,840","02:33,640","\"In fucking Ocarina of Time, you had to like shoot the moon or like the sun and then fire arrows or light arrows, but was it light or fire?\""]
["02:33,640","02:34,440","\"Not sure.\""]
["02:34,440","02:37,440","\"It was one that wasn't really used. I think it was fire, right?\""]
["02:37,440","02:38,740","\"And what?\""]
["02:38,740","02:40,040","\"'Cause it falls from the sun.\""]
["02:40,040","02:41,240","\"Um, when you're a...\""]
["02:41,240","02:47,040","\"When you're an adult, you shoot the sun in Ocarina of Time in like the Zora Keep area.\""]
["02:47,040","02:50,440","\"Yeah, and then you're like your arrow lights on fire and then you get like the thing.\""]
["02:50,440","02:51,740","\"Yeah, you get like the fire arrows.\""]
["02:51,740","02:52,740","\"Do you see that?\""]

["02:54,680","02:57,820","\"And he gets all blushy and horny and the king looks at him.\""]
["02:57,820","03:00,140","\"He's like, \"\"What the fuck?\"\"\""]
["03:00,140","03:02,280","\"\"\"Don't fuck that very-\"\"\""]

["11:00,060","11:04,860","\"You can roll into the fire with your invincibility frames and then skip this whole shit really yeah\""]
["11:04,860","11:08,620","\"That's what speedrunners do they just skip this shit. Yeah, they just roll\""]
["11:08,620","11:12,500","\"They just use the damage boost from the fire to hurt themselves you roll into it\""]
["11:12,600","11:15,320","\"You you get hit and then immediately roll into it. Oh\""]
["11:15,320","11:20,200","\"You have to get hit before you roll into the fire. What's the fire? I'll push you back. So like that\""]

["11:51,400","11:56,860","\"And you have the option to spit on it if you want\""]
["11:56,860","11:59,320","\"Yeah, this is when beating them is okay\""]
