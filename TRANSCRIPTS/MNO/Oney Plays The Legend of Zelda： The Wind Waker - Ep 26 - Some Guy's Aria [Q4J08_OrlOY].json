["17:42,720","17:44,880","\"You're right if you won't have the little guy\""]
["17:44,880","17:49,180","\"Mako can fucking use his brain. We need a little guy though. Really?\""]

["17:52,120","17:55,040","\"In there\""]
["17:55,040","18:04,220","\"Oh, I guess we could just bring this a little forward, huh?\""]
["18:04,220","18:10,300","\"And block off both of them. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, and then you make that one the one you use block the other one off\""]
["18:10,300","18:12,300","\"You're so right Corey\""]
["18:19,540","18:25,620","\"For a puzzle to see what me buddy. We're almost done. This is not a flowing back in the dungeon\""]

["18:28,260","18:31,260","\"Chris I forgot who the boss is in this dungeon. Mm-hmm. Oh\""]
["18:31,260","18:34,660","\"some foreign dude\""]
["18:34,660","18:38,340","\"It's Corey's mom after she gets the code\""]
["18:38,340","18:41,460","\"My mom\""]
["18:41,460","18:45,700","\"My step that would just be an alien who comes down and teleports us to heaven\""]
["18:45,700","18:49,140","\"You'd be like save look how easy it was for me to get here\""]
["18:49,140","18:51,740","\"And all I needed was my code.\""]
["18:51,740","18:55,540","\"You're dead, learn that the transmission after he gets his code.\""]
["18:55,540","18:57,340","\"That's basically what he would get, yeah.\""]
["18:57,340","19:00,140","\"Oh, I would give anything to learn instant transmission.\""]
["19:00,140","19:04,340","\"It costs $1,400 and to go to England and get your code, Dave.\""]
["19:04,340","19:07,640","\"Uh, well, I don't think the code will give me instant transmission.\""]
["19:07,640","19:11,900","\"It takes six months to permeate, so you have to wait six months after spending $1,400,\""]
["19:11,900","19:12,900","\"but it does happen.\""]
["19:12,900","19:14,860","\"It takes six months to dilate after you eat your code.\""]
["19:14,860","19:16,860","\"Is there a downside to instant transmission?\""]
["19:16,860","19:17,860","\"Uh, no.\""]
["19:17,860","19:18,860","\"No.\""]
["19:18,860","19:20,860","\"It's just the distance you can go.\""]
["19:20,860","19:23,380","\"Like you have to be able to think of it and imagine it.\""]
["19:23,380","19:25,420","\"Or you need to be able to like concentrate on it.\""]
["19:25,420","19:28,820","\"So in times when Goku's like, I can't get there,\""]
["19:28,820","19:31,860","\"I need them to use their power level to increase it.\""]
["19:31,860","19:33,540","\"- Basically it's like it has to be somewhere\""]
["19:33,540","19:36,460","\"you've already been or somebody you know has to be there\""]
["19:36,460","19:38,380","\"to where they can put out an energy signal for you.\""]
["19:38,380","19:39,380","\"- Yeah.\""]
["19:39,380","19:42,540","\"And in Super there was a scene which made Gohan\""]
["19:42,540","19:44,660","\"just the biggest fucking loser ever\""]
["19:44,660","19:46,420","\"where he made himself so strong\""]
["19:46,420","19:47,820","\"just to get the energy thing.\""]
["19:47,820","19:55,060","\"So Goku could come this was in Resurrection F and do everything and Gohan could just eat shit and die\""]
["19:55,060","20:01,640","\"And it was really lame and I hated it. That's pretty cool. Resurrection F is fucking terrible. Hey, well\""]
["20:01,640","20:03,640","\"You mean the series or the movie?\""]
["20:03,640","20:08,560","\"Resurrection F is the second. Honestly the movies not that good either, but I like the movie was fine\""]
["20:08,560","20:15,300","\"It's it's not as good as it's it's uh, I would consider them not canon at this point because they're just like dumb\""]
["20:15,300","20:16,300","\"No, they are kidding.\""]
["20:16,300","20:17,300","\"But it was fun.\""]
["20:17,300","20:21,540","\"No, I know they are kind of, but in my mind, I'm like, everything after Thal didn't happen.\""]
["20:21,540","20:26,900","\"I don't like Resurrection F because it just feels kind of stupid how it happens.\""]
["20:26,900","20:29,060","\"And then it almost is forgotten immediately.\""]
["20:29,060","20:31,420","\"Damn, that's a pretty good effect for the GameCube.\""]
["20:31,420","20:33,060","\"Yeah, it's nice.\""]
["20:33,060","20:34,060","\"Wow.\""]
["20:34,060","20:37,420","\"I don't like Resurrection F. Chris, I'm sorry.\""]
["20:37,420","20:38,420","\"That's fine, Corey.\""]
["20:38,420","20:39,420","\"You don't have to like it.\""]
["20:39,420","20:41,740","\"Oh, it's this weird dumb sand fucking shark.\""]
