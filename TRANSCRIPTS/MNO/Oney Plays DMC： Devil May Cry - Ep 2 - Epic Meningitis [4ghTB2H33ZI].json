["06:24,620","06:25,620","\"He is boring.\""]
["06:25,620","06:27,820","\"He has no personality.\""]
["06:27,820","06:31,620","\"You're never gonna guess if he's gonna end up as a good guy or bad guy at the end.\""]
["06:31,620","06:34,120","\"You literally would never guess.\""]
["06:34,120","06:35,920","\"It's Dante's origin.\""]

["06:53,820","07:01,860","\"I always find like I don't know why people think that that's like a sympathetic origin like they kept doing that in RPGs for a while\""]
["07:01,860","07:07,140","\"It's like you were the king and you had everything and then and then you were in the kitchen all the way\""]
["07:07,140","07:12,980","\"I think it's kind of cool. I really I'm always like why did why does anyone deserve to be the fucking king?\""]
["07:12,980","07:17,580","\"Just out of the gate. I mean it's cool. Human suffering is kind of relative though, right?\""]
["07:17,580","07:23,140","\"If the person starts off cocking it arrogant and then they they learn to be like, you know, like a good person then it's fine\""]
["07:23,140","07:29,340","\"But I mean it's a very cliched story. You're right. I'm talking about like like fable or yeah\""]
["07:29,340","07:34,020","\"Dragon age did it the reason fable sucked at doing is because they didn't make you learn anything from it\""]

["07:41,980","07:45,180","\"Probably did it fable three they did it in like\""]
["07:45,180","07:49,820","\"Almost every single dragon age. I'm pretty sure they did it in like a ton of different gate\""]
["07:49,820","07:52,500","\"I don't know it was like the trope for a while like yeah\""]
["07:52,500","07:56,660","\"- You were the king and then I fucking lost your humor.\""]
["07:56,660","07:58,080","\"- Did Fable just didn't feel good either\""]
["07:58,080","07:59,460","\"'cause everyone's like cracking jokes\""]
["07:59,460","08:00,740","\"while horrible shit's going on.\""]
["08:00,740","08:01,900","\"- And then you become the king\""]

["08:03,740","08:04,580","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:04,580","08:07,260","\"- Now Fable 3 I think is probably the stupidest\""]

["08:08,940","08:10,020","\"- And then it's just the game about\""]
["08:10,020","08:11,740","\"who you give your money to.\""]
["08:11,740","08:14,900","\"- I would much play Chupacabra over Fable 3.\""]
["08:14,900","08:16,860","\"Chupacabra is pretty sick.\""]
