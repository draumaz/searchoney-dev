["01:14,680","01:19,480","\"Was so fully wholly absorbed in my dancing. I did not notice I was dancing on a dead body\""]
["01:19,480","01:22,280","\"He's making a humping gesture towards you. It seems thought\""]
["01:22,280","01:26,560","\"That's because oh ready guy one two one two\""]

["01:35,340","01:37,180","\"He's talking about the guy cranking the thing. Don't it?\""]
["01:37,180","01:41,400","\"Is he really yeah, he wants you to do this storm dance\""]
["01:41,400","01:55,600","\"Actually, I really I really do adore this our stuff, but because it is\""]
["01:55,600","02:00,300","\"He's uh, cel shade without the fucking nasty outlines.\""]
["02:00,300","02:01,300","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["02:01,300","02:02,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:02,300","02:03,300","\"They do that back calling thing.\""]
["02:03,300","02:07,840","\"I never really look good to me, but I do like cel shaded when it's still like this.\""]
["02:07,840","02:09,840","\"Like actually cel shaded?\""]
["02:09,840","02:10,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:10,840","02:13,920","\"I feel like cel shaded can be cool with the black outline sometimes.\""]
["02:13,920","02:17,000","\"It can, but no one really ever does it right.\""]
["02:17,000","02:18,000","\"I'm feeling pretty good.\""]
["02:18,000","02:19,000","\"Why?\""]
["02:19,000","02:20,000","\"Because I recently got myself a pet pig.\""]
["02:20,000","02:21,000","\"Three in fact.\""]
["02:21,000","02:22,000","\"He looks like one.\""]

["02:23,000","02:25,520","\"Oh, he's got the pig nose.\""]
["02:25,520","02:32,500","\"Hmm fucking pretty good. He's thinking about fucking his pigs. It's impossible not to sing along with this beautiful song\""]
["02:32,500","02:36,920","\"I listened this last night. I think I pointed out that is the cockrika village thing. Why are you doing?\""]
["02:36,920","02:38,920","\"Go fucking it. Oh\""]
["02:38,920","02:43,380","\"You know the cockrika song is so good. I still love\""]
["02:43,380","02:48,620","\"Fishing to that song in ocarina time. Yeah, get in oh\""]
["02:48,620","02:53,180","\"My god it faded he morphed\""]
["02:55,120","02:57,680","\"Everything's still fine. Where's all the pussy yet?\""]
["02:57,680","03:05,840","\"He sees me he knows what's up. Yeah, he does. And if you drop a pile in a stupid clown head\""]
["03:05,840","03:10,800","\"Wait, what am I doing here? You get on the fan. Am I?\""]
["03:10,800","03:14,000","\"Decapitate yourself. That's his money\""]
["03:14,000","03:22,380","\"Oh no, what are that? How'd you sneak in here you little rat?\""]
["03:23,000","03:28,900","\"Furman, what's his problem? He's an asshole. So that's definitely not the right way to go, right?\""]
["03:28,900","03:31,600","\"There's I mean, there's gotta be something about that, right? You have to save the kids.\""]
["03:31,600","03:38,720","\"What? It's not abducting children. No, you have to go do the kid thing. Oh, I don't you're talking about. Oh the kid thing.\""]
["03:38,720","03:44,280","\"And the day like goes, it has to be nighttime when you see people in the house. Are you sure? Okay, you fuck this guy.\""]
["03:44,280","03:47,080","\"Yeah, cuz there's a boat that shows up. Yeah, my boat is your name.\""]
["03:47,080","03:51,760","\"And there's the big island I gotta go to. No, you have?\""]
["03:52,320","03:56,440","\"There is a weird thing so when I remove the signal he slows down. It's really weird\""]
["03:56,440","04:00,260","\"No, I did not mean to do\""]
["04:00,260","04:06,100","\"What the fuck you stupid speak to him from under the bolt thing here go underneath and speak\""]
["04:06,100","04:08,520","\"That is the coolest shit I've ever seen\""]
["04:08,520","04:13,920","\"He's looking to you through the cracks. He starts pissing down into it and start traveling\""]
["04:13,920","04:27,200","\"I think cruising in this game is the most satisfying thing in the world.\""]
["04:27,200","04:29,840","\"I like when the water sprays when you go on fast.\""]
["04:29,840","04:33,100","\"Okay, I got a quick mic.\""]
["04:33,100","04:35,100","\"My sale of fail is the college.\""]
["04:35,100","04:36,100","\"I don't know what...\""]
["04:36,100","04:38,100","\"I do call it that.\""]
["04:38,100","04:40,380","\"Oh, nice.\""]
["04:40,380","04:43,100","\"And the GameCube one you have a sale that's like two times faster.\""]
["04:43,100","04:49,460","\"I mean the Wii U version yeah the Wii U version kind of defeats the entire point of the game though don't it it is\""]
["04:49,460","04:57,300","\"Only slightly faster, so it's not the worst thing ever. Yeah. I mean I will admit like sailing is boring, but\""]
["04:57,300","05:03,540","\"Making everything like way faster kind of just makes the game feel not like an adventure\""]
["05:03,540","05:08,420","\"That's the the ocean makes so big even though it's kind of empty it like it's atmospheric and it feels good\""]
["05:08,420","05:13,200","\"Yeah, but it did get bored, but I think if I if I were to replay this in my own time\""]
["05:13,200","05:16,660","\"I think I would really like mellow out and chill to just like surfing the seas\""]
["05:16,660","05:22,300","\"I think the best part about this game is this song because once you go out through the ocean you can listen to the song forever\""]
["05:22,300","05:27,540","\"Yeah, I said that the song it would be fucking this. I just be boring. It's just like sickles, huh?\""]
["05:27,540","05:32,140","\"You just have to listen to the boys in your head. Go crazy. Oh, there's the guy in the boat\""]
["05:32,140","05:35,700","\"Thank you\""]
["05:35,700","05:36,900","\"You're a biomarker, can't be.\""]
["05:36,900","05:38,700","\"Oh, fuck you.\""]
["05:38,700","05:41,900","\"Oh, I love the seagulls that follow you.\""]
["05:41,900","05:43,900","\"You can shoot them down, they can shatter the Colossus.\""]
["05:43,900","05:48,380","\"I'm trying to think of a way to make sailing in a game fun, but like, it's just, I mean,\""]
["05:48,380","05:49,540","\"you can't get everything.\""]
["05:49,540","05:50,540","\"You can stop and do.\""]
["05:50,540","05:53,420","\"Essentially, you're just holding up, but uh...\""]
["05:53,420","05:57,460","\"You could make sailing interesting.\""]
["05:57,460","05:59,980","\"In this game, you can change the way in which is cool.\""]
["05:59,980","06:01,460","\"Yeah, that's nice.\""]
["06:01,460","06:03,460","\"Aww, four goals.\""]
["06:03,460","06:07,380","\"I hate the way the fucking clouds at the top just cut in here.\""]
["06:07,380","06:09,620","\"Wait, what do you mean?\""]
["06:09,620","06:10,340","\"You'll see.\""]
["06:10,340","06:11,620","\"Just like a basic graphic.\""]
["06:11,620","06:12,740","\"That's it.\""]
["06:12,740","06:14,820","\"Should've faded in, you know?\""]
["06:14,820","06:21,940","\"Listen, they had the N64 technology and then they got GameCube and they just like\""]
["06:21,940","06:24,260","\"fuck the pop and we'll just have a pop straight in.\""]
["06:24,260","06:25,860","\"I'm the horizon.\""]
["06:25,860","06:28,100","\"Don't mean it any weird N64 fog.\""]
["06:28,100","06:29,380","\"I'm not gonna push A here.\""]
["06:30,260","06:34,840","\"That's okay. You can make it to the island. You have to bump the island after. Oh, no. He slows right down. Fuck!\""]
["06:34,840","06:42,340","\"That is our destination death boil. Dragon roost. Best song in the game? Maybe. Maybe not. It's really good.\""]
["06:42,340","06:47,440","\"I fuck it. Hey, I fucking love\""]
["06:47,440","06:50,980","\"this song and the sailing.\""]
["06:50,980","06:56,660","\"High top this island's peak lives the spirit of the sky is a great dragon by the name of alloo.\""]
["06:56,660","06:59,140","\"He's just dumping ass in the top of the tunnel.\""]
["06:59,140","07:00,140","\"This is toilet.\""]
["07:00,140","07:05,060","\"You must go see the dragon and request from him a jewel called Den's Pearl.\""]
["07:05,060","07:06,060","\"Ballu?\""]
["07:06,060","07:10,460","\"Ask the people of the Rado tribe how to poop like the dragon.\""]
["07:10,460","07:13,060","\"Okay, the dragon.\""]
["07:13,060","07:16,180","\"Oh my god.\""]

["10:41,560","10:45,660","\"Yeah, but these birds don't come down and like tear off the arm for fun and games\""]
["10:45,660","10:51,440","\"You sure they do of course they do never see a hawk fly down and rip the head off a pigeon and eat it in front of you\""]
["10:51,440","10:55,660","\"I'm always afraid that'll happen. I'm actually seeing you told me there's like some\""]
["10:55,660","10:57,820","\"I don't know if it was like a type of bird\""]
["10:57,820","11:01,620","\"But it was a bird that went up to another little bird and just like grabbed by the head and slammed it around\""]
["11:03,460","11:09,040","\"I don't know I feel like I've seen that before. It's Jesus Christ. It wasn't a pigeon, but it was a type of pigeon\""]
