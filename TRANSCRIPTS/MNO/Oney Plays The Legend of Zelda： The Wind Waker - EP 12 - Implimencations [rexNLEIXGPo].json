["03:34,200","03:36,040","\"Would you be afraid?\""]

["04:14,640","04:20,720","\"You haven't seen the same episode of Hey Arnold that I've seen there has never been an episode where Arnold is ripped to shreds\""]
["04:20,720","04:25,160","\"This episode where his dad punches a shark in the head\""]
["04:25,160","04:31,360","\"This is that where all the sharks ging up on him and he's trying to fight them off in the water\""]
["04:31,360","04:35,960","\"It's that old guy. Yeah, and then like he punches it square in the nose. That's not his dad\""]

["05:52,780","05:55,240","\"If you think about it realistically\""]
["05:55,240","06:00,340","\"I was gonna say yeah, cuz what if Chris did to use iron boots and sink to the bottom of the ocean?\""]
["06:00,340","06:02,980","\"What would he see? I guess it's a high-ro thing that's at the bottom right?\""]
["06:03,140","06:09,560","\"You can't use iron boots when you're in the boat because obviously you kill the boat. Yeah, you would sink the boat\""]
["06:09,560","06:12,380","\"Those things kind of scare me not gonna lie\""]

["06:22,700","06:27,980","\"You know these like lookout towers have like items and shit, but they're kind of hard to get to and not really worth it\""]
["06:27,980","06:28,820","\"- That's never worth it.\""]
["06:28,820","06:31,300","\"- They have like just 20 bucks in each of them.\""]
["06:31,300","06:32,140","\"- You should lie.\""]

["06:32,980","06:34,540","\"- They're not really like that important.\""]
["06:34,540","06:35,380","\"But at the same time,\""]
["06:35,380","06:37,020","\"like that was my favorite thing about Wind Waker\""]
["06:37,020","06:39,060","\"was to explore every bit of square\""]
["06:39,060","06:40,980","\"and see what, like this is a part of the square\""]
["06:40,980","06:42,780","\"that you're on right now, this one.\""]
["06:42,780","06:44,460","\"Where it would be like something in there,\""]

["06:51,780","06:53,460","\"you do it like 20 times.\""]
["06:53,460","06:54,940","\"- You can only spank so many tarts\""]
["06:54,940","06:56,620","\"so your butt hang, it's tired.\""]
["06:56,620","07:00,300","\"That's a good way of putting it\""]
["07:00,300","07:04,460","\"They really are they just sort of sit there and lose their weapon and then he's\""]

["08:53,660","08:59,540","\"It makes you waste time that was watching a speedrunner play this game and he accidentally put the sale up in the middle of a boss fight and fucking died\""]
["08:59,540","09:06,300","\"That's sad. He was like I'm so mad. I'm just gonna stop playing for the day and I'm like I understand\""]

["09:58,780","10:04,500","\"Don't know like no no no he the place is flooded and he was turned into a boat\""]
["10:04,500","10:11,300","\"Because into a boat yeah, yeah over years of like fucking people he eventually learned to become a boat\""]
["10:11,300","10:17,300","\"You guys ever seen that clip from the older team with a guy that gets on the ground and transforms into a car?\""]
["10:17,300","10:27,880","\"After years of natural evolution to battle like water he finally learned how to turn into a boat. He's hands and he's in screen\""]
["10:27,880","10:33,780","\"Like whoever turned him into a boat picked the most convenient thing for him to be in this world\""]
["10:33,780","10:40,400","\"Yeah, Ganon's like you're a boat with a sail and you will also have a bond compartment later with a grapple hook and all these other things\""]
["10:40,400","10:41,900","\"that Link will use to defeat me.\""]
["10:41,900","10:43,560","\"- The king of our lives like, and?\""]
["10:43,560","10:45,440","\"(laughs)\""]
["10:45,440","10:47,520","\"- What if you turn him into a brick?\""]
["10:47,520","10:49,240","\"See, that was way worse.\""]
["10:49,240","10:51,520","\"- He's like, get it, get it, he's like,\""]
["10:51,520","10:52,640","\"don't turn me into a boat.\""]
["10:52,640","10:54,520","\"He's like, that'd be a great idea.\""]
["10:54,520","10:56,440","\"He just turns him into a fucking old, sorry.\""]
["10:56,440","10:57,280","\"(laughs)\""]
["10:57,280","10:59,280","\"He turns him into a rock and he's like, fuck.\""]
["10:59,280","11:00,600","\"(laughs)\""]
["11:00,600","11:01,440","\"He's hit through.\""]
["11:01,440","11:03,720","\"- The worst thing to be turned into\""]
["11:03,720","11:05,280","\"is that thing from the little mermaid.\""]
["11:05,280","11:06,680","\"- Tetra got turned into a pirate.\""]
["11:06,680","11:07,640","\"- A pirate with those little worms?\""]
["11:07,640","11:08,880","\"- Yes.\""]
["11:08,880","11:09,880","\"I mean, that would suck.\""]
["11:09,880","11:10,880","\"That would suck.\""]
["11:10,880","11:11,880","\"That would suck.\""]
["11:11,880","11:13,080","\"Why are there no Zoras in this game?\""]
["11:13,080","11:15,280","\"Yeah, you think it'd be the one game.\""]
["11:15,280","11:19,480","\"There's game theories implied that the birds that fly around.\""]
["11:19,480","11:21,880","\"I know right there are the Zoras, but that's just so...\""]
["11:21,880","11:26,120","\"But there... no, there's implementations because you remember...\""]
["11:26,120","11:27,880","\"Okay, do you remember Maldi?\""]
["11:27,880","11:28,880","\"Medley.\""]
["11:28,880","11:34,680","\"Medley, when she finds out she's like a goddess, there's like that Zora who has like the music\""]

["11:35,680","11:36,680","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:36,680","11:37,680","\"And she's like the descendant.\""]
["11:37,680","11:38,680","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:38,680","11:45,580","\"So that's why it's implied that like the bird people were evolutions of Zora's all I'm saying is you don't fucking evolve into a bird\""]
["11:45,580","11:47,580","\"If the world turns in the water\""]
