["00:15,440","00:16,880","\"I think she can get off the switch.\""]
["00:16,880","00:18,000","\"I don't think it'll do anything.\""]
["00:18,000","00:18,520","\"Oh, OK.\""]
["00:18,520","00:21,640","\"She's picking her butt right now, waiting.\""]
["00:21,640","00:24,360","\"She's picking long parasites out of her asshole.\""]
["00:24,360","00:26,840","\"She's yanking the feathers out of her skin, going crazy,\""]
["00:26,840","00:28,600","\"like parrots do.\""]
["00:28,600","00:32,400","\"When birds start going crazy, Dave, did you know this?\""]
["00:32,400","00:36,360","\"When birds start going crazy, they start tearing the feathers out of them, squawking constantly.\""]

["00:56,760","00:57,760","\"I mean, I guess.\""]

["01:19,520","01:26,160","\"No, okay, I see this is relevant so you have to move that I\""]
["01:26,160","01:31,160","\"She's getting irradiated.\""]
["01:31,160","01:36,160","\"But I mean she's already like fucking transport monster anyways.\""]

["01:39,160","01:42,160","\"Yeah, see now you shine it on that thing.\""]
["01:42,160","01:44,160","\"There's lots of places you can shine it.\""]
["01:44,160","01:47,160","\"And then it goes back to the bird village and she just glows in the dark.\""]
["01:47,160","01:49,160","\"Oh, that's just a joy panic, Chris.\""]
["01:49,160","01:50,160","\"Don't be fooled.\""]
["01:50,160","01:54,160","\"It's another medley.\""]

["03:08,680","03:15,240","\"Did you really be like a concert? Oh, is that a morbid curiosity? I was a backfest and I saw there's a Bernal Floss panel\""]
["03:15,240","03:19,800","\"I'm like oh Bernal Floss. I laugh at him and so I went to his thing and\""]
["03:19,800","03:26,400","\"And it was like he was playing the Wii Shop networks on he made and it was really awkward.\""]
["03:26,400","03:30,800","\"I know we're like 10 people there who are like just dancing in place and like skanking.\""]
["03:30,800","03:33,800","\"And at that point I was like I need to get out of here. I feel sick.\""]
["03:33,800","03:39,800","\"And I didn't stick around too long and I left but that was like five or six years ago.\""]
