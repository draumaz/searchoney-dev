["12:34,480","12:38,000","\"And then I started to feel back so I was getting like less work done\""]
["12:38,000","12:41,040","\"So I would hop online and my rule was if Jeff was playing it\""]
["12:41,040","12:46,480","\"I would play it and Jeff was playing this game like 24/7 on fucking stop. I was like God Jeff loves his fucking game\""]

["13:17,900","13:20,740","\"That made me feel like an asshole. I would laugh I laughed for you\""]
["13:22,400","13:27,600","\"You were like, how many achievements you got? You're like dude, I put it in like twice. That was a weird thing. That was a weird thing because I'm...\""]

["13:32,800","13:52,340","\"Which you do after like just a few hours, which Jeff never got it. He was playing... like... You and I were playing over a hundred hours. I was like, what was this autistic moron? I was like, Jeff must have just been like, he's just rubbing his face. He has like the textures and the scenery. He's like not playing the game. I'm like, I'm doing like the Metal Gear Solid like, not Kettle the problem. You don't bring out your nose for the game. But you haven't killed a thousand other guys.

["14:12,780","14:14,140","\"- So, Jeff, how far did you get?\""]
["14:14,140","14:15,620","\"- Did you ever meet? - I just made it one time.\""]
["14:15,620","14:16,860","\"- Okay, okay.\""]
["14:16,860","14:18,700","\"- I like this like, really.\""]
["14:18,700","14:20,580","\"- I started playing it again on, um,\""]
["14:20,580","14:21,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["14:21,580","14:23,580","\"Sparta, whatever, Modo, whatever.\""]
["14:23,580","14:30,460","\"But then I got distracted with Sekiro because Sekiro came out like a week after this.\""]
["14:30,460","14:35,660","\"So I just went to that and then after that, I didn't, I never finished that game because\""]
["14:35,660","14:39,220","\"then I went out to San Diego or Burbank to see you guys.\""]
["14:39,220","14:40,820","\"I lost interest in Sekiro pretty close.\""]

["14:45,020","14:47,900","\"Chris, what is, what is, alright, so Dark Souls is your favorite from Software Game?\""]
["14:47,900","14:49,900","\"Well, what's your, like, your second and third favorite?\""]
["14:49,900","14:53,380","\"Okay, no, I like Dark Souls 1 very then bloodborne\""]
["14:53,380","15:03,240","\"Demon souls then Dark Souls 2 then Dark Souls 3 that's fair the thing about Dark Souls 3 that like it's like a common argue point is\""]
["15:03,240","15:07,820","\"Play demon souls. I didn't beat it. I got halfway through it\""]
["15:07,820","15:11,180","\"Demon souls is flawed and not that great, but it's still like got so much heart and soul\""]
["15:11,180","15:16,420","\"It is fun, but I will say that there are some areas that are fucking dastard. Yeah, no no no\""]
["15:16,420","15:19,660","\"Yeah, it's it's completely like flawed, but it is fun though\""]
["15:19,660","15:27,460","\"But it feels way more like an actual world than fucking Dark Souls two or three Dark Souls three pretty much just like retreads the book on\""]
["15:27,460","15:32,780","\"Demon's three is nothing to me. It's fucking boring. It pretty much after playing Demon's Souls\""]
["15:32,780","15:37,460","\"I understand now why there were so many like people who are upset with Dark Souls three\""]
["15:37,460","15:39,940","\"Yeah, because it was too much of like install debating\""]
["15:39,940","15:45,100","\"Yeah, it wasn't enough like and I get it now because I play Demon's Souls. Yeah, I understand\""]
["15:45,940","15:50,100","\"The games like that was the one game I had him play it I played Dark Souls one two three\""]
["15:50,100","15:53,720","\"Bloodborne and this one and now I understand why people have such a problem\""]
["15:53,720","15:59,120","\"It's so frustrating that in Dark Souls two and three like you think they would have fixed it again for three that you have to\""]
["15:59,120","16:03,420","\"Go back to this fucking place to level up. Why can't they just let you sit at the fire and do it?\""]
["16:03,420","16:07,580","\"I prefer that. I don't really like having a girl dude. He looks like fucking Finn Wolford\""]
["16:11,980","16:17,540","\"When you were saying like placing stuff that stuff reminds me of like dragons dogma because you can place like teleporter points\""]
["16:17,540","16:20,000","\"Wait, wait, no, I want you to say dragons doge from now on okay\""]
["16:20,000","16:28,860","\"Have you replaced dragons dogma I want to watch Jeff play it's a very good game\""]

["16:38,860","16:45,360","\"Yeah, my devil but I might cry three four and five you get these things in the game called their pawns, right?\""]
["16:45,360","16:46,360","\"Is that what?\""]
["16:46,360","16:48,360","\"Yeah, fodder\""]
["16:48,360","16:56,100","\"But like you go you go into like a corridor\""]
["17:03,540","17:05,540","\"- That's awesome. - That's awesome.\""]
["17:05,540","17:07,740","\"- Dragon's talking to us like a weird circular story.\""]

["17:08,580","17:09,420","\"- It's hard to explain.\""]
["17:09,420","17:10,500","\"- No!\""]
["17:10,500","17:13,300","\"It's really good when the pawn system is really interesting\""]
["17:13,300","17:16,460","\"because it's like you basically have these brain dead pawns\""]
["17:16,460","17:19,500","\"who don't even know their ass from their like fucking elbow.\""]
["17:19,500","17:22,700","\"And you have to teach them how to be human beings.\""]
["17:22,700","17:25,260","\"- Tell me how you describe them dying and coming back to me.\""]
["17:25,260","17:26,260","\"- They're so stupid.\""]
["17:26,260","17:28,380","\"You go into a place that they're learning\""]
["17:28,380","17:32,020","\"and they're like, they're like, he's like,\""]
["17:32,020","17:33,200","\"- Does he say a Risen?\""]
["17:33,200","17:34,840","\"- You said they come into the room\""]

["17:36,440","17:37,300","\"I will go forth.\"\"\""]
["17:37,300","17:39,740","\"And they go out and immediately get hit by someone\""]
["17:39,740","17:42,200","\"with a fucking hammer and knocked off a cliff and die.\""]
["17:42,200","17:43,900","\"And then they teleport back in, they're like,\""]
["17:43,900","17:46,780","\"\"\"Oh, that was a trifling challenge.\"\"\""]
["17:46,780","17:48,360","\"And they go out and be like, \"\"Don't worry.\""]
["17:48,360","17:49,420","\"I will check out again.\"\"\""]
["17:49,420","17:52,300","\"And they immediately walk outside and get hit again.\""]
["17:52,300","17:53,600","\"And they repeat the process.\""]
["17:53,600","17:56,700","\"It's like, the thing is, once they get hit\""]
["17:56,700","17:59,460","\"like three or four times and they get knocked enough around,\""]
["17:59,460","18:01,540","\"they're like, \"\"Oh, there's an enemy right there.\"\"\""]
["18:01,540","18:03,460","\"So when you come in with a person who doesn't\""]
["18:03,460","18:06,940","\"play the place, they'll be like, oh, Arisen,\""]
["18:06,940","18:08,420","\"there's an enemy with a hammer out there.\""]
["18:08,420","18:09,580","\"Be careful.\""]
["18:09,580","18:11,100","\"And they warn you ahead of time.\""]
["18:11,100","18:12,220","\"So you kind of like--\""]
["18:12,220","18:14,580","\"they get their ass kicked enough to learn not to go to--\""]
["18:14,580","18:15,860","\"They do learn things.\""]
["18:15,860","18:17,340","\"They learn things.\""]
["18:17,340","18:21,820","\"And so basically, you make one pawn for yourself,\""]
["18:21,820","18:24,860","\"and you can hire two more of two other people's pawns.\""]
["18:24,860","18:26,860","\"So if you have a friend on your friend list,\""]
["18:26,860","18:28,140","\"you can hire their pawn.\""]
["18:28,140","18:28,980","\"That's cool.\""]
["18:28,980","18:29,820","\"And it's really cool.\""]
["18:29,820","18:31,740","\"and make and learn stuff from your game\""]
["18:31,740","18:33,420","\"and then go back to their game\""]
["18:33,420","18:35,460","\"with like new information on how to eat something.\""]
["18:35,460","18:36,660","\"- So when you walk into a room there,\""]
["18:36,660","18:38,900","\"but like, \"\"Arisen, this person's weak to light.\"\"\""]
["18:38,900","18:40,560","\"And it's like, \"\"Okay, so you come in\""]
["18:40,560","18:42,100","\"\"\"and you know that you get to use a light spell,\""]
["18:42,100","18:44,860","\"\"\"or you come in there like, fire is what you should use\""]
["18:44,860","18:46,060","\"\"\"here, Arisen.\"\" - Yes, yes, no.\""]
["18:46,060","18:48,260","\"- And it's just like, you basically,\""]

["18:52,940","18:54,740","\"- There's all this like hidden like stuff.\""]
["18:54,740","18:56,940","\"And that's because as the previous player\""]
["18:56,940","18:59,180","\"found the secret, they gained that knowledge\""]
["18:59,180","19:01,820","\"Because once you go back, you basically like quiz them.\""]
["19:01,820","19:02,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["19:02,660","19:03,940","\"- Like at the end of the day, you're like,\""]
["19:03,940","19:05,740","\"all right, idiot, would you learn today?\""]

["19:09,340","19:10,540","\"They're like, all right, cool.\""]
["19:10,540","19:12,060","\"You leveled up the point.\""]
["19:12,060","19:13,900","\"And then you go online to see like people\""]

["19:27,540","19:29,100","\"You get one and a half stars.\""]
