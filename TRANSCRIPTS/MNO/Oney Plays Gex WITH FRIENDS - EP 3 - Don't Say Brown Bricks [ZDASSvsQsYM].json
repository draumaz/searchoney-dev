["04:26,820","04:30,820","\"You're right, I don't like people who call themselves critics either.\""]
["04:30,820","04:32,740","\"What were they thinking when they made this?\""]
["04:32,740","04:33,740","\"They were all high.\""]
["04:33,740","04:35,580","\"They must have been on drug.\""]
["04:35,580","04:39,900","\"So uh, we just did that with Resident Evil 7.\""]
["04:39,900","04:41,060","\"What's your, what's your rebuttal?\""]
["04:41,060","04:42,900","\"We're making fun of their names.\""]
["04:42,900","04:43,900","\"That's different.\""]
["04:43,900","04:46,540","\"You have a goofy name.\""]
["04:46,540","04:49,020","\"What do you mean that the fact that we didn't like the game?\""]
["04:49,020","04:50,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:50,020","04:51,020","\"That we paid $60 for?\""]
["04:51,020","04:52,020","\"You didn't bet.\""]
["04:52,020","04:53,020","\"You didn't bet.\""]
["04:53,020","04:54,020","\"You didn't bet.\""]
["04:54,020","04:55,020","\"That was yours.\""]
["04:55,020","04:57,220","\"I would have paid for it.\""]
["04:57,220","04:58,220","\"I would have paid for it.\""]
["04:58,220","04:59,220","\"I would have paid for it.\""]
["04:59,220","05:00,220","\"My heart was good.\""]
["05:00,220","05:03,540","\"That makes sense because you have to buy it to even know if it's...\""]
["05:03,540","05:04,540","\"I hate that by the way.\""]
["05:04,540","05:05,540","\"I'd die.\""]
["05:05,540","05:09,860","\"Something to me and that's gone now because of this it's why games like this\""]
["05:09,860","05:13,140","\"I actually get to sell because triple a titles wouldn't be selling if you could rent them\""]
["05:13,140","05:17,140","\"You would rent it once you would play through it you take it back. There's no replay value\""]
["05:17,140","05:21,200","\"Games wouldn't be able to catch on like I agree with that\""]
["05:21,200","05:22,840","\"I always\""]
["05:22,840","05:29,140","\"Test things out for free before I actually buy them and I do buy them like I spend money when I decide that I like a thing\""]
["05:29,140","05:34,120","\"You know what? I just I realized what I was talking about what I say\""]
["05:34,120","05:39,360","\"I don't like critics who run sleep rip on shit. I don't like it when they do it when they don't do anything themselves\""]
["05:39,360","05:43,560","\"As in like like no cuz he did things\""]
["05:43,560","05:49,000","\"Like they were bad. That's even worse when you do things that are shitty and then you still go and rip on everything\""]
["05:49,000","05:49,920","\"I\""]
["05:49,920","05:56,120","\"Think that's bizarre is people who act like they they understand all this could easily be in a position like well\""]
["05:56,120","05:58,580","\"That's almost all what critic has ever like\""]
["05:59,800","06:02,800","\"- The Eberts movie got this place of medium.\""]
["06:02,800","06:05,000","\"- That's the thing is I don't think there's ever been\""]
["06:05,000","06:06,920","\"a thing where people generally agreed\""]
["06:06,920","06:08,280","\"that their thing was good.\""]
["06:08,280","06:09,600","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:09,600","06:11,200","\"- I've never seen it so I can't speak.\""]
["06:11,200","06:14,280","\"- I can't think of too many times that it's happened though.\""]
["06:14,280","06:15,200","\"- I can't think of any.\""]
["06:15,200","06:18,640","\"- Yatsi made games that weren't very good.\""]
["06:18,640","06:21,120","\"- People who make things don't have time to be critics.\""]
["06:21,120","06:22,200","\"- That's true too.\""]
["06:22,200","06:23,040","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:23,040","06:26,080","\"- But they do have time to be that's why.\""]
["06:26,080","06:28,320","\"- I guess construction is starting now.\""]
["06:28,320","06:30,320","\"It's just going for the fuck.\""]
["06:30,320","06:32,800","\"Let's play is fucking easy.\""]
["06:32,800","06:34,120","\"It's true.\""]
["06:34,120","06:37,440","\"Do you know anyone can do it?\""]
["06:37,440","06:41,120","\"Meep.\""]
["06:41,120","06:43,680","\"Ding Dong is making us play this at five in the morning.\""]
["06:43,680","06:45,720","\"Not five in the morning.\""]
["06:45,720","06:46,720","\"Oh, let me see.\""]
["06:46,720","06:47,520","\"It's four twenty.\""]
["06:47,520","06:48,920","\"He's making us play it.\""]
["06:48,920","06:49,600","\"Four twenty.\""]
["06:49,600","06:53,160","\"He had to play Resident Evil and put up with that shit.\""]
["06:53,160","06:54,440","\"Or don't.\""]
["06:54,440","06:55,000","\"I don't know.\""]
["06:55,000","06:56,000","\"That rape.\""]
["06:56,000","06:57,600","\"He definitely said rape, for sure.\""]
["06:57,600","07:04,040","\"Don't say brown bricks. I did not I said bra. He said bra\""]
["07:04,040","07:09,200","\"Jimmy\""]
["07:09,200","07:17,320","\"I like these I like that there's TV static just kind of picking through walls. Yeah me too. That's a fun idea\""]
["07:17,320","07:23,840","\"There's cool idea. I think yeah, this is I'm not I I don't think this is a bad game. Oh\""]
["07:23,840","07:25,640","\"so far I\""]
["07:25,640","07:32,540","\"This is uh, this seems perfectly serviceable. It's kind of the con I mean, it's I don't know again\""]
["07:32,540","07:38,380","\"I don't know why he's a gecko. There's no reason for him to be a gecko, but yeah, but that has no association with television\""]
["07:38,380","07:45,820","\"No, it's not his design. It's just that he's a gecko has nothing to do with television. That's the only issue I have\""]
["07:45,820","07:49,540","\"Well Mario's a plumber and plumbing has nothing to do with the game\""]
["07:49,540","07:53,920","\"He goes through pipes. He throws fire at people. Why is he fucking plumber?\""]
["07:54,800","07:56,800","\"She's not electrician. I\""]
["07:56,800","08:04,260","\"Heard that static is remnants of the big bang static shock. I heard static on the television is\""]
["08:04,260","08:09,980","\"He said he said I lost my friend cuz you're stupid racism. I hate you\""]
["08:09,980","08:12,800","\"What static appears I tell my mother\""]
["08:12,800","08:20,600","\"The aesthetic shot what's that a shot is the black superhero? We were having he's not the black superhero\""]
["08:21,840","08:26,020","\"- He probably would have at the time.\""]
["08:26,020","08:29,480","\"We were watching Static Shock\""]
["08:29,480","08:31,600","\"and we were having a discussion about how\""]
["08:31,600","08:32,440","\"- People say it's a very--\""]
["08:32,440","08:35,040","\"- Apparently, yeah, apparently people consider it\""]
["08:35,040","08:39,440","\"very progressive and important to watch and everything.\""]
["08:39,440","08:43,780","\"And what I say to that is that, okay,\""]
["08:43,780","08:46,360","\"if it's supposed to be socially progressive\""]
["08:46,360","08:50,160","\"and you're supposed to take a lot of value from it,\""]
["08:50,160","08:56,000","\"Why is it that he never rectifies the fact that all the villains he fights live in poverty?\""]
["08:56,000","08:59,400","\"And that's the reason that they steal and do bad things.\""]
["08:59,400","09:05,520","\"Like he should probably be addressing that issue in the city as opposed to beating them up.\""]
["09:05,520","09:10,000","\"-That's a very hard to take seriously in some of the episodes. -Well, yeah, because it's also very...\""]
["09:10,000","09:15,480","\"-Your school shooting one is very, very good. -It's really heavy-handed, and they don't know how to handle all these...\""]
["09:15,480","09:18,520","\"-All these issues at the very end. -Make a fight in Armadillo, man.\""]
["09:18,520","09:20,520","\"And then the kid shoots the school up.\""]
["09:20,520","09:22,520","\"(crowd laughs)\""]
["09:22,520","09:23,520","\"- What did he say?\""]
["09:23,520","09:24,800","\"- He said if there was a plane crash\""]
["09:24,800","09:25,960","\"I could eat the passengers.\""]
["09:25,960","09:26,800","\"Why is he saying that?\""]
["09:26,800","09:27,800","\"- Yeah, what does that mean?\""]
["09:27,800","09:30,240","\"- What the fuck is wrong with him?\""]
["09:30,240","09:33,240","\"- I think there's a reason this came to catch on.\""]
["09:33,240","09:35,040","\"- I guess it's impressive that they could store\""]
["09:35,040","09:37,160","\"all those sound bites, right?\""]
["09:37,160","09:38,760","\"- There aren't that many though.\""]
["09:38,760","09:41,480","\"He's been saying the same like four things.\""]
["09:41,480","09:43,480","\"- Are they not, are they not context sensitive?\""]
["09:43,480","09:44,840","\"Like for the level?\""]
["09:44,840","09:47,000","\"- They are sometimes, but usually not.\""]
["09:47,000","09:48,240","\"And no, not to the level.\""]
["09:48,240","09:50,440","\"It's like, depending on what level.\""]
["09:50,440","09:53,440","\"- I assume that like he would say something different\""]
["09:53,440","09:55,120","\"in the spooky level from like the--\""]
["09:55,120","09:57,500","\"- Well he does, but I thought you meant like,\""]
["09:57,500","09:59,660","\"oh this moment in the level has a lot of water,\""]
["09:59,660","10:00,920","\"so maybe I'll just say something like that.\""]
["10:00,920","10:02,640","\"- No, no, I just mean like per level.\""]
["10:02,640","10:05,240","\"- And they did that, that would be way more impressive.\""]
["10:05,240","10:08,240","\"Is actually structuring it around the level design or something.\""]
["10:08,240","10:10,560","\"How touched were you by the static shock episode\""]
["10:10,560","10:12,280","\"where boys shoot school?\""]
["10:12,280","10:13,120","\"- No.\""]
["10:13,120","10:14,720","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:14,720","10:15,560","\"- There was--\""]
