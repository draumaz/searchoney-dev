["00:40,800","00:43,200","\"Well, now you're gonna remember forever.\""]
["00:43,200","00:46,800","\"You just follow the line of things trying to kill you and eventually you'll find the way.\""]
["00:46,800","00:49,600","\"As in life so to his video games.\""]
["00:49,600","00:52,000","\"Definitely good advice.\""]
["00:52,000","00:57,600","\"If there's nothing trying to kill you in a given spot, you're obviously not doing it right.\""]
["00:57,600","01:03,120","\"That's why going to war is the most right thing you could ever do yeah, it's like a guaranteed like\""]
["01:03,120","01:06,640","\"It's guaranteed you're doing the right thing\""]
["01:06,640","01:12,460","\"If anybody's oh, okay. Well tired of that I\""]

["01:30,800","01:35,840","\"It's not really a spoiler cuz like it I don't think they effectively did anything with it\""]
["01:35,840","01:38,520","\"It was nothing, but did they make a big deal out of it?\""]
["01:38,520","01:40,240","\"Not really like a little bit\""]
["01:40,240","01:45,520","\"He's just like I've to I've invented this thing to kill dragons and then they hit a dragon once and it's fine\""]
["01:45,520","01:52,000","\"He just like storm back with the receipt like\""]
["01:54,040","01:56,040","\"No, he's just was the only drum\""]
["01:56,040","02:00,200","\"Yeah, I bought this from you didn't work\""]
["02:00,200","02:08,400","\"It's clearly used I don't have a policy against that. I don't take these things back\""]

["02:12,080","02:16,760","\"Well, I know it could be the thing could be fucking dead and you you're just fucking with me\""]
["02:16,760","02:21,480","\"Do you plan a little dragon you got what you wanted and now you're trying to get a refund\""]
["02:21,480","02:23,480","\"Do you plan to watch a game of Thrones though?\""]
["02:23,480","02:31,960","\"Yeah, I'm actually like a season it's pretty good. I like it. I was not prepared for I was expecting it to be a lot more like kind of\""]
["02:31,960","02:39,520","\"Monotone than it was. Yeah, and there's like all these like wacky cartoon characters doing silly things and I'm kind of happy with that\""]
["02:39,520","02:41,660","\"Yeah, it's just fun. I like it\""]
["02:41,660","02:45,440","\"You it's a human thing to try to find humor in like the darkest shit\""]
["02:45,440","02:50,680","\"That's and it's also like contrast like if you don't have characters that are occasionally happy\""]
["02:50,680","02:55,960","\"You don't fucking care when they're miserable. Yeah, that's true. You know do you feel me? I feel you\""]
["02:55,960","02:59,980","\"But what else do you feel Chris my dick?\""]
["02:59,980","03:04,120","\"Is it is it slimy? Is there a particular way you need?\""]
["03:04,120","03:09,360","\"I think I need to fucking blow that door to hell. Oh, I see so now you turn it back\""]
["03:09,360","03:14,000","\"Yeah, I want to see what's at the top of that ladder first though. Maybe it's my dreams\""]
["03:14,000","03:17,400","\"Becoming a country music artist\""]
["03:17,920","03:22,800","\"Or maybe it's a fucking box with red shit in it. There we go. Yummy red shit\""]
["03:22,800","03:26,160","\"The good thing about old game design is they don't respect you as much\""]
["03:26,160","03:29,520","\"They they go you don't have shit to do\""]
["03:29,520","03:41,080","\"Was imagine being late for something and I guess you just fucking pause the game and go do it\""]
["03:41,080","03:43,440","\"Yeah, I mean you could pause games back then\""]
["03:44,200","03:47,680","\"What if we get to a point where like it's a legitimate excuse?\""]
["03:47,680","03:55,720","\"Like your boss is super furious with you you're late for work and you're like wait you don't understand. I was solving a God of War puzzle\""]
["03:55,720","04:02,680","\"And then suddenly he's like well, oh, okay. I can relate to that. We have kind of interesting things like that like smoke breaks\""]
["04:02,680","04:05,560","\"Like that's like a socially acceptable\""]
["04:05,560","04:11,040","\"I was gonna say it's and it's it's one of those things that were it feels like it's a stay over from like World War two\""]
["04:11,040","04:15,420","\"Or will war one even like where it's like that you have to respect the smoke break\""]
["04:15,420","04:22,360","\"You know even though only like 20% of Americans smoke now like they used to think it was healthy for you\""]
["04:22,360","04:29,180","\"Yeah, well, I mean I think the whole thing was that like whatever tobacco company like convinced\""]
["04:29,180","04:32,780","\"Like these guys know this needs to be part of like standard\""]
["04:32,780","04:39,240","\"This is this needs to be part of the standard like kit and they got an entire generation of GIs hooked on cigarettes\""]
["04:39,320","04:43,720","\"Maybe bosses just feel they get better work out of employees when they have their smoke breaks\""]
["04:43,720","04:49,620","\"Otherwise the employees are just not fun. I don't know what I noticed about guys that take smoke breaks is they take them very frequently\""]
["04:49,620","04:57,100","\"I mean the thing about it is like it's beneficial to someone to have an entire society with an oral fixation\""]
["04:57,100","05:03,000","\"So you do what you can to encourage it by making hourly employees have an excuse\""]
["05:03,000","05:09,100","\"To just not work all those hours, and then you got it you got a society that's willing to suck\""]
["05:09,100","05:17,300","\"And uh that I'm still trying to figure out who but somebody gets a profound amount of mileage out of that\""]
["05:17,300","05:19,300","\"Everything in America is full of sugar\""]
["05:19,300","05:21,700","\"Just too much\""]
["05:21,700","05:27,500","\"There's so much dang sugar something I noticed when I was in Hong Kong is that they added sugar to like a lot of things\""]
["05:27,500","05:30,620","\"Serious. Yeah, sugar's like the fucking worst\""]
["05:30,620","05:36,340","\"But but but everyone in Hong Kong is in way better shape than everyone in America\""]
["05:36,340","05:40,740","\"It's because they because they have way smaller servings like every other country\""]
["05:40,740","05:46,660","\"They also run faster so they need more sugar and they sweat a lot because Hong Kong's friggin humid as hell\""]
["05:46,660","05:49,820","\"And they're always running what wouldn't that mean sodium though?\""]
["05:49,820","05:52,820","\"Is that what you do for sweating you need you need salt?\""]
["05:52,820","05:54,340","\"I get you need electrolytes\""]
["05:54,340","05:58,140","\"I mean an insult is an easy way to get them remember kids eat your salt\""]
["05:58,140","06:03,380","\"Our meals could technically be a lot cheaper if we all just sort of agreed that they need didn't need to be as big\""]
["06:03,980","06:09,380","\"But I don't know it's kind of hard to un-pull that trigger, but Tomar\""]
["06:09,380","06:14,580","\"We're big look at this fucking guy. He's just a guy who wants to be a dick\""]
["06:14,580","06:23,740","\"He's just been standing there for the last like four hours holding that\""]
["06:23,740","06:28,500","\"Doesn't like you it's actually super satisfying. I know right\""]
["06:33,300","06:35,760","\"Yo, man, if you break that last part, oh man\""]
["06:35,760","06:42,020","\"Don't do it, man. What was you gonna say don't break those pots man? They're Greek pots\""]
["06:42,020","06:49,100","\"Now they broken ass their greasion urge ain't holding shit. No more ain't earning me nothing\""]
["06:49,100","06:53,380","\"Oh man that was some witty wordplay\""]
["06:53,380","07:00,500","\"witty witty word play why are you leaving pot smile? Oh my god you first you don't want me to yeah\""]
["07:00,500","07:04,620","\"Well now you fucking already started breaking them if you don't break them all when I get up to see you\""]
["07:04,620","07:10,120","\"It's all they're triggered Chris's oh, so hey, I just do what's like time-efficient\""]
["07:10,120","07:15,140","\"So when it starts getting to the point where breaking them is tedious. I leave okay fine\""]
["07:15,140","07:19,500","\"Just break the ones that I can just get that water looks too real man\""]
["07:19,500","07:25,940","\"Man with this chicken man those blades look too real man. I'm a fucking video game\""]
["07:25,940","07:27,940","\"Then you come up here with this shit\""]
["07:27,940","07:31,540","\"Remind me of the harsh reality of my existence fuck\""]
["07:31,540","07:36,860","\"Damn, man. Yeah, break down man back who the fuck?\""]
["07:36,860","07:40,020","\"What's that I don't even know\""]
