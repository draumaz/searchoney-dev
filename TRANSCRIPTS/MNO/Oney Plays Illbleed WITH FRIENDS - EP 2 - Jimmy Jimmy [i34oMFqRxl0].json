["11:59,400","12:03,240","\"That's the PS3 actually. No, but the PS2 just looks slim and black and cool.\""]
["12:03,240","12:05,800","\"And kids were just like, whoa, it's futuristic.\""]
["12:05,800","12:09,440","\"Dreamcast looks like a fat mean as shit.\""]

["13:17,620","13:20,420","\"Don't go speeding on the creepy highway\""]
["13:20,420","13:23,660","\"So what happens here is that he tries to corner you in this hallway\""]
["13:23,660","13:28,760","\"And you can hear him kind of in the distance trying to sneak up behind you or get in front of you\""]
["13:28,760","13:30,260","\"but\""]
["13:30,260","13:35,460","\"If you want an easy way getting past him because what's supposed to happen is they just runs into you and you have to keep running away\""]
["13:35,460","13:37,220","\"From him and fights\""]
["13:37,220","13:41,100","\"You just keep pulling the map up. It stops him dead in his tracks wherever he is\""]
["13:41,660","13:49,300","\"So if I see him and I pop the map it'll stop him. I can just walk around him serious. So it's probably coming up\""]
