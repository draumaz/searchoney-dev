["06:24,500","06:27,660","\"Hyruleia thing no is it good?\""]
["06:27,660","06:33,700","\"It's interesting because they it's like they're acting like all the Zelda games were planned out from the start\""]
["06:33,700","06:39,380","\"Which I really don't think that's for sure. It tries to like tie them all into a timeline where it's like\""]
["06:39,780","06:43,980","\"But but like on top of that there's like a branching timeline. Yeah from\""]
["06:43,980","06:49,220","\"Where ocarina of time starts they use that as an excuse of like whoa\""]
["06:49,220","06:57,540","\"I remember someone saying that the official timeline was provenly wrong like they fuck it up like that\""]

["07:01,860","07:06,900","\"Apparently they somehow got that wrong like and it makes no sense or something\""]
["07:06,900","07:11,620","\"But I haven't looked into it. I feel like yeah, if you could probably disprove it with all sorts of stuff if you\""]
["07:11,620","07:14,420","\"rooted deep into the games\""]
["07:14,420","07:22,280","\"But the idea is like whether or not Gannon gets to oh whether or not Link gets defeated in like ocarina of time\""]
["07:22,280","07:28,700","\"Has a lot to do with like which timeline main timeline you go down look at this new place so far\""]
["07:28,700","07:34,860","\"There's more to Mars wherever you go. This is my harbor town. Follow me. Do you not chase me? I am my name?\""]
