["06:11,880","06:18,300","\"I'd be very upset what if you could see through the banana like you watch it you can switch personalities with the\""]
["06:18,300","06:23,880","\"Don't know what I do and probably\""]
["06:23,880","06:30,900","\"Probably what would you hide the banana somewhere so you could swap with no I would I would have a mental breakdown\""]
["06:31,800","06:36,240","\"I'd have a panic attack probably that every day the bananas like I'd have a banana attack\""]
["06:36,240","06:38,240","\"I could feel myself rotting\""]
["06:38,240","06:43,200","\"Pain is so bad, but it's like me any any pain the banana feels you feel\""]
["06:43,200","06:48,800","\"Oh, no, I do that I'd have to I think it's I don't I think it's more disturbing to just observe it\""]
["06:48,800","06:51,840","\"Mattie's because if we if he's in the whole time\""]
["06:51,840","06:56,740","\"He's gonna he's not gonna he's not gonna be able to like fully grasp the existential weight of it\""]
["06:56,740","06:58,200","\"This sounds like a terrifying nightmare\""]
["06:58,200","07:00,380","\"I put him in the freezer and I pull him out and he's all frozen\""]
["07:00,380","07:06,260","\"He's got like a terrified face on and yeah, and he can't really wake up and I've ruined it and Matt every week a new member of your\""]
["07:06,260","07:08,640","\"Families your family gets added to yeah\""]
["07:08,640","07:15,560","\"Faces start appearing yeah up and down the link. I probably take the peel off microwave and masturbate with it. There's\""]
["07:15,560","07:20,360","\"The first day that you held it had your face on it as you felt the banana\""]
["07:20,360","07:24,860","\"You could feel something kicking inside of it and it all could do is scream\""]
["07:25,000","07:30,220","\"At each day a new face of a family member would appear on the banana screaming in pain. It starts pretty\""]
["07:30,220","07:35,260","\"And they're trying to get you to open the banana, but you're afraid to don't know what's actually inside of the banana\""]
["07:35,260","07:40,700","\"Oh wait no, I thought that the banana was fully peeled and had my face on it. No. No, it's just a tip\""]
["07:40,700","07:44,560","\"No, but Chris said no you peel the last thing off. It shows my face. Yeah\""]
["07:44,560","07:50,000","\"My eyes are exposed to the natural light. I'm not used to this or hurts\""]
["07:50,000","07:53,040","\"Please put the peel back up, but you can't what I staple it back shut\""]
["07:53,040","07:59,640","\"No, you just kind of flop it back down and leave him rested. Oh, no, well, there's Matt Watify predicted natural disasters\""]
["07:59,640","08:04,400","\"This becoming a little bloated\""]
["08:04,400","08:11,940","\"Less of a reason to kill it. I don't know I would have what was the reason to kill it to begin with because it's terrifying\""]
["08:11,940","08:14,560","\"But then I would have this strange guilt on my conscience for the rest of my life\""]
["08:14,560","08:19,940","\"Exactly like maybe like what if this was the biggest break in scientific history and I can I killed it before they\""]
["08:19,940","08:21,940","\"That's why it's a\""]
["08:21,940","08:28,340","\"Hypothetical is a good one you have a big choice to make no, but they don't when they make no sense like the fucking tiny Hitler thing\""]
["08:28,340","08:30,340","\"That made sense to me it made no sense\""]
["08:30,340","08:33,060","\"Okay, Matt your brain is exposed\""]
["08:33,060","08:42,100","\"I'd be dead I know what is some sort of I go into some sort of coma or okay, Matt your brain is exposed and\""]
["08:42,100","08:46,780","\"And boys it embarrassing. It's real embarrassed. No\""]
["08:48,060","08:50,060","\"Can't believe I came to the ball like this\""]
["08:50,060","08:54,440","\"Okay, Matt would you rather have your brain be exposed or?\""]
["08:54,440","09:01,340","\"Your heart be exposed I die regardless. No you wouldn't not necessarily\""]
["09:01,340","09:08,220","\"I think if your heart's exposed you'd be fine. You wouldn't die regardless the the yeah cuz in surgery that your heart's exposed\""]
["09:08,220","09:11,860","\"I guess your brain is exposed in surgery and by expose. I don't mean it's bloody and out\""]
["09:11,860","09:16,380","\"But the brain is more sensitive than your heart is right inside of your rib cage beating away, you know\""]
["09:16,380","09:22,540","\"If I barely if if say I had my branding exposed if like let's say a bug comes and lands on my brain\""]
["09:22,540","09:25,820","\"Fucking kill forget the letter B. Yeah\""]
["09:25,820","09:33,100","\"But like my heart it's like I think that's more okay, and it's easier to control like the area around my my brain\""]
["09:33,100","09:36,100","\"I can't really see what's going on but my heart that's right in front of me. Okay, Matt\""]
["09:36,100","09:43,200","\"What would you rather your brain be exposed with no skull or your heart be on top of your skull beating away wait no\""]
["09:43,740","09:48,280","\"So it's just a brain in this head now. He doesn't have a skull. Yeah, so he has like a gelatinous blob\""]
["09:48,280","09:53,260","\"That's what I was that's what I meant. I don't like these images. They're disturbing. I love them. That's why I'm saying them\""]
["09:53,260","10:01,020","\"Stop I just want to smash a little better around Matt your brain is pulsing without a skull on top of your head like the fucking Mars attacks aliens\""]
["10:01,020","10:07,460","\"Or you have a skull the veins on your body were ten times larger. Oh my god. That's gross\""]
["10:07,460","10:12,780","\"That's gross, but my brain without a skull and just a pulsing you know\""]
["10:12,780","10:18,280","\"I said would you rather have the the exposed brain on your skull rather none of this fucking answer\""]
["10:18,280","10:21,540","\"Would you rather have the brain exposed? I know they're my heart on top of my head\""]
["10:21,540","10:23,700","\"That would look more normal than having just a fucking brain\""]
["10:23,700","10:28,700","\"But if fucking someone came over and slapped you in your head your heart would explode if someone slapped my brain\""]
["10:28,700","10:30,700","\"I would die not necessarily\""]
["10:30,700","10:36,340","\"Or you get really smart\""]
["10:36,340","10:42,340","\"Slappy on the brain you go. Oh, I know you think about balls. Oh, isn't isn't that a sponge, Bob?\""]
