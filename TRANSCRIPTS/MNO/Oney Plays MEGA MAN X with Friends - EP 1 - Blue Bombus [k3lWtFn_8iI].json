["01:33,700","01:35,800","\"it just gets you in the mood to buy some Google Glass.\""]
["01:35,800","01:37,760","\"And then they turn on 180.\""]
["01:37,760","01:39,520","\"- You forget he's like beating the shit out of her,\""]

["07:14,740","07:16,180","\"I'm not sad at all.\""]
["07:16,180","07:18,340","\"Because they were clearly all very sad that he had died,\""]
