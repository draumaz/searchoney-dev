["10:19,980","10:23,760","\"Wait a second. Why doesn't his shadow have a shadow?\""]
["10:23,760","10:27,680","\"Because it's a shadow. It's not even a shadow. No, it's a water thing\""]
["10:27,680","10:34,060","\"Where do you think it is? I don't know for a game about light and dark that sure don't look like a shadow\""]
["10:35,800","10:37,080","\"Huh?\""]
["10:37,080","10:44,600","\"This is fun. Oh, no, he's casting spells. This is so fucking annoying to watch. You have to cast counter spells\""]

["10:48,160","10:55,840","\"What's awkward fucking game? Yeah, stop him. Well, what do you think that even means that he's casting spells? I don't Christ\""]

["10:59,200","11:03,480","\"He'd be made out of water and it'd be really weird if you hadn't stopped it\""]
["11:03,480","11:08,160","\"He would have made all of the land green with beautiful trees and rivers\""]
["11:08,160","11:11,600","\"Stop him\""]
["11:11,600","11:13,080","\"Get that\""]

["11:16,880","11:21,300","\"My gosh, I fight to the death\""]
["11:21,300","11:25,080","\"They're always so beautiful. He's these little helicopter birds\""]
["11:25,080","11:31,720","\"They're small and there's in small numbers. Why do they all like them so much? They keep making them\""]
["11:32,640","11:38,340","\"Also, they I thought they were the the Shang-Kang Kang Kang man. No, they're just everywhere\""]
["11:38,340","11:41,780","\"They had dogs on the pirate ship\""]
["11:41,780","11:44,640","\"Who cares? I\""]
["11:44,640","11:46,820","\"Want to be a heartless?\""]
["11:46,820","11:51,840","\"You think there's a reason why they don't like theme the heartless is as much in this one\""]
["11:51,840","11:55,100","\"Easier, yeah, probably\""]
["11:55,100","11:57,960","\"Like I said, I'm sure they were having issues\""]
["11:57,960","12:01,240","\"I mean you still have to come up with like a similar amount of designs\""]
["12:01,240","12:07,640","\"Yeah, but I feel like with storage space and everything they couldn't just have every world have a ton of fuck enemies this time\""]
["12:07,640","12:10,920","\"Around or something. I don't know did they was this a rush game?\""]
["12:10,920","12:15,440","\"It's not rushed. I just feel like with the scope of it for a ps2 game\""]
["12:15,440","12:22,120","\"There's probably only so much they could do a single disc. I guess that's true. Isn't it when I was like 12 through?\""]
["12:22,120","12:26,560","\"20 I love the open world games, but now I can't stand most of them\""]
["12:26,560","12:32,720","\"Love linear games now. I don't have any issue with open world. It's just I hope your world has stuff to do they never do\""]
["12:32,720","12:37,680","\"I'm trying to think of I was playing Saints Road to recently as everyone a fun with that\""]
["12:37,680","12:44,000","\"I wonder if people have gone back to that recently because it's a lot of fun if people just wanted like silly grandpa\""]
["12:44,000","12:50,560","\"Bato as opposed the direction that kind of went into I just think open world games should be more like toyish\""]
["12:50,560","12:53,280","\"Like there should be just silly things you can do everywhere\""]
["12:54,000","12:58,000","\"A bunch of different systems you can just have lots of things to do.\""]
["12:58,000","13:02,720","\"Open World games went from the idea of feeling like there was a lot to do to a lot of them\""]
["13:02,720","13:05,600","\"just kind of being wide open because people seem to...\""]
["13:05,600","13:09,160","\"I think it's also because people didn't know what they wanted out of an open world either.\""]
["13:09,160","13:12,360","\"People usually just say they want an open world, they won't go into why they want one,\""]
["13:12,360","13:15,880","\"they won't say like, \"\"Oh I want an open one with a lot of fun stuff to do.\"\"\""]
["13:15,880","13:17,680","\"It's usually just \"\"I want an open world.\"\"\""]
["13:17,680","13:21,640","\"It's just a big illusion, it gives you the idea that it's a big free place to do stuff,\""]
["13:21,640","13:22,640","\"but there's nothing to do.\""]
["13:22,640","13:26,680","\"I mean, that's what's been happening sometimes you get an open world, but then there's not much in there\""]
["13:26,680","13:31,160","\"We played fear recently like it was it was really linear, but there was so much fun shit\""]
["13:31,160","13:34,360","\"You could fuck with did you ever played the first pray?\""]
["13:34,360","13:38,840","\"No, what you mean the one on the Xbox you're sick. No, everyone said it was shit\""]
["13:38,840","13:44,560","\"Really the first one? Yeah, I'm working in GameStop and everyone said it sucked ass really I liked it a lot\""]
["13:44,560","13:49,560","\"I thought it was fun really it's a fun game. Oh, it's got a it's got a cool idea around it\""]
["13:49,560","13:52,600","\"You get abducted by aliens and you're trying to escape like their ship and everything.\""]
["13:52,600","13:53,600","\"That's cool.\""]
["13:53,600","13:54,600","\"It's a neat game.\""]
["13:54,600","13:56,400","\"I thought it was a lot of fun.\""]
["13:56,400","13:59,400","\"The very opening, you're in a bar and you can play all their arcade machines in the\""]

["14:45,040","14:50,000","\"In San Andres, you can drive a train so fast that it would derail and come off the tracks,\""]

["15:09,240","15:11,720","\"I did, the bike would just always explode.\""]
["15:11,720","15:16,200","\"I'm pretty sure they patched that out like after a few months, but when I first got it,\""]
["15:16,200","15:18,000","\"that pissed me the fuck off.\""]
["15:18,000","15:21,880","\"No matter what I did, some little tiny drop would blow you up and it would just...\""]

["15:47,620","15:54,020","\"So just no fucking point San Andreas have the jet pack which was cool. San Andreas is so much fun\""]
["15:54,020","15:57,120","\"Yeah, there's so much shit to do you know what there was one way sorry\""]
["15:57,120","16:00,840","\"I keep saying it there's one more thing I really wanted to do in GTA 5 that disappointed me was\""]
["16:00,840","16:05,520","\"You know that there's cable cars to go up the mountain. Yeah, I figured since they put those in there would be a way to\""]

["16:07,520","16:09,520","\"Yeah, it's on a wire.\""]

["16:15,520","16:18,520","\"For us, Free Mode Online was some of the funnest shit ever.\""]

["16:34,960","16:35,800","\"- Yeah.\""]
["16:35,800","16:37,120","\"- Sometimes if you got bumped by a car,\""]

["16:46,560","16:48,520","\"They tired out this poor 2D plane.\""]
["16:48,520","16:51,480","\"- There was a cool mod that let you just grab things.\""]

["16:55,720","16:56,800","\"That's just a fun thing.\""]
["16:56,800","16:58,800","\"- Your hands would be attached to the vehicle\""]

["17:41,940","17:47,780","\"Yeah, I think it's because they were nervous about their multiplayer service, but who cares?\""]
["17:47,780","17:53,800","\"It's multiplayer well ever since then they've ever since people modded in San Andres for the hot coffee thing\""]
["17:53,800","17:58,980","\"They freak out over it well with that one it seems like they freaked out more because the multiplayer service\""]
