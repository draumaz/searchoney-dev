["06:58,780","07:01,620","\"That big buff guy has the best voice out of all these guys.\""]
["07:06,140","07:08,060","\"For fans of Final Fantasy of old.\""]
["07:08,060","07:09,420","\"What a way to start your game.\""]
["07:09,420","07:11,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:11,940","07:16,420","\"This is emotional.\""]

["07:21,300","07:24,620","\"I'm just going to I'm just going to accept this.\""]
["07:24,620","07:27,020","\"I don't even know as an artistic decision.\""]
["07:27,020","07:30,940","\"It's weird how quick it's stopped right in to this.\""]
["07:30,940","07:32,300","\"And not even to real.\""]
["07:32,300","07:34,620","\"Yeah, it's hot in a way that doesn't really make sense.\""]
["07:34,620","07:39,020","\"Pushing a car that's really you started on a fight you didn't get all except it for the fight\""]
["07:39,020","07:43,520","\"And now you're pushing a car. I'll accept it as a bold stylistic decision\""]
["07:43,520","07:49,820","\"But I don't mind it starting you off like but if this is supposed to be like\""]
["07:49,820","07:52,860","\"If this is supposed to be appealing to a mainstream audience\""]
["07:52,860","07:56,460","\"I think this is a bad way to start you get are we still pushing the car? Yes\""]
["07:56,460","07:59,340","\"Remember Final Fantasy 7\""]
["07:59,340","08:03,340","\"That was the music play when he pushed the car.\""]
["08:03,340","08:05,340","\"We're supposed to be listening to the conversation.\""]
["08:05,340","08:07,340","\"The trains broke down and he had to push the train.\""]
["08:07,340","08:16,340","\"Is it actually playing stand by me?\""]

["09:05,980","09:06,980","\"He's like shaking.\""]
["09:06,980","09:09,820","\"It's because of the motion capture is broken.\""]
["09:09,820","09:13,620","\"It's weird seeing character designs like this and they're trying to make them look\""]
