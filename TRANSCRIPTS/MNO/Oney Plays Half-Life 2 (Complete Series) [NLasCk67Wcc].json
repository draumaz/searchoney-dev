["03:27,420","03:34,380","\"dude stupid guys getting fucked up fucking war on he's so dumb we're back we're\""]
["03:34,380","03:41,320","\"right I'm stupid I'm bigger than you I am the so I played to before I knew\""]
["03:41,320","03:48,280","\"anything about one so I didn't know these guys were aliens well this one's not\""]
["03:48,280","03:52,600","\"obviously he's not no I didn't know either I just assumed they were people\""]
["03:52,600","03:57,400","\"yeah I thought they were just like a stand-in for Nazis as per usual has\""]
["03:57,400","04:01,560","\"we ever been a part where you see them without the suits I don't think so yeah\""]
["04:01,560","04:05,800","\"I don't think so either that would be kind of cool maybe they're just robots\""]
["04:05,800","04:10,280","\"That the aliens control no, they're silly. They're silly little guys\""]
["04:10,280","04:18,940","\"Tomer that's gonna be you someday a little splatter of blood on the ground. It's interesting all these aliens just happen to speak English\""]
["04:18,940","04:25,600","\"It's a good video game\""]
["04:25,600","04:34,060","\"So this is one of the things that really bothers me about this game\""]
["04:34,060","04:38,860","\"And I'm gonna try to keep the negativity to a minimum because I actually fucking hate this game\""]
["04:38,860","04:41,460","\"Maybe I'll re-experience it. Maybe I'll change my mind on it\""]
["04:41,460","04:42,900","\"I'm trying to keep an open mind\""]
["04:42,900","04:49,860","\"The fact that Barney talks to Gordon Freeman like they were like old college drinking buddies and Gordon Freeman used to be the fucking life of the party\""]
["04:49,860","04:57,620","\"insinuates that Gordon Freeman has a personality and either he's like talking and you don't hear him or like it's just weird\""]
["04:57,620","05:03,260","\"It's just weird because all he does is just stare at people silently and murder guys with crowbars\""]
["05:03,260","05:07,520","\"But everyone's like Gordon my best friend. I have such a close personal attachment to you\""]
["05:07,520","05:13,840","\"It's like but why I'm like a non vocal socio-pass because we're Hollywood elite pita files\""]
["05:13,840","05:17,040","\"Don't you see so just the fact that you keep silent about the Peter\""]
["05:17,040","05:23,040","\"Like\""]
["05:23,040","05:30,140","\"Okay\""]
["05:30,140","05:35,780","\"So Tomar this is this is why this game is good get a box put it there go up the leg\""]
["05:35,780","05:40,420","\"Oh, yeah, this is what it's for sorry\""]
["05:40,420","05:45,280","\"No, so well, I agree. I don't think this game is perfect, but I do think it is mostly good\""]
["05:45,280","05:49,740","\"I do like to fit like I like G-mod a lot. I like fucking around with the engine\""]
["05:49,740","05:54,780","\"Yeah, I just don't think the game is like anything all that special. Have you ever seen a game do that before?\""]
["05:54,780","05:59,380","\"Break Prusples pretty late. See sure and this came out in\""]
["05:59,980","06:04,940","\"1994 so that's pretty cool did not yeah, maybe that's maybe that's a little bit of the problem is I played it like\""]
["06:04,940","06:09,580","\"2004 I played it much later. Oh really played it. Yeah, I played it\""]
["06:09,580","06:14,460","\"Maybe whatever the orange box came out on the Xbox. Oh, okay. That was the first time I played it\""]
["06:14,460","06:16,460","\"This came out around a time when people\""]
["06:16,460","06:20,220","\"Like you know they're intertwining these little cutscenes with the gameplay\""]
["06:20,220","06:24,780","\"So it's like immersing you with the world a little more so at the time people were like this is a new cool thing\""]
["06:24,780","06:29,960","\"Yeah, I had played like a zillion billion games that have done that by the time this came out\""]
["06:29,960","06:33,660","\"Like I'd already played BioShock before I played a Half-Life 2.\""]
["06:33,660","06:34,960","\"- Oh. - So that--\""]
["06:34,960","06:36,760","\"- BioShock came later though. - Yeah, yeah.\""]
["06:36,760","06:40,960","\"And BioShock obviously takes a lot of ideas from Half-Life.\""]
["06:40,960","06:41,960","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:41,960","06:45,960","\"- Oh!\""]
["06:45,960","06:47,960","\"- I'm sorry, he's pissed! - I'm sorry!\""]
["06:47,960","06:48,960","\"- I'm sorry!\""]
["06:48,960","06:51,460","\"- I'm fucking middle.\""]
["06:51,460","06:52,960","\"- That's the rule though.\""]
["06:52,960","06:56,960","\"You're allowed to take two swings at a lawbreaker\""]
["06:56,960","06:58,460","\"and then you have to stand down.\""]
["06:58,460","07:00,460","\"We were already gonna go on a doe.\""]
["07:00,460","07:04,940","\"It looks like he's gonna beat that dude. I don't think this is supposed to happen. I'm just like\""]
["07:04,940","07:08,080","\"This is a mistake. Is he stuck behind that guy?\""]
["07:08,080","07:11,180","\"Can I make him hit him?\""]
["07:11,180","07:14,700","\"This is a weird little thing.\""]
["07:14,700","07:22,340","\"Throw some Chinese food out of make him swing. Oh fuck. Oh damn it! Fuck!\""]
["07:22,340","07:24,860","\"I thought I was gonna cheat the system.\""]
["07:24,860","07:27,460","\"Is your earnal? Eat out of that garbage.\""]
["07:27,460","07:32,460","\"Good.\""]
["07:32,460","07:37,860","\"Let's stalk this woman.\""]
["07:37,860","07:41,620","\"You're playing cameraman for a machinima.\""]
["07:41,620","07:43,020","\"Oh yeah, this is a machinima.\""]
["07:43,020","07:47,260","\"It's like a normal day for this woman walking down this road.\""]
["07:47,260","07:49,620","\"What's she holding like a bucket of popcorn?\""]
["07:49,620","07:53,540","\"Dude, circle like 2000, 2010.\""]
["07:53,540","07:55,500","\"There were some real pretentious ones out there.\""]
["07:55,500","07:56,500","\"I would love to see you.\""]
["07:56,500","08:02,340","\"Remember I saw one where it was like it was like a an homage to 2001 a space\""]
["08:02,340","08:07,680","\"Odyssey and it was made in Halo 1 in a year when like it was like after Halo\""]
["08:07,680","08:11,720","\"Reach was out it was like trying to be really intense and atmospheric and it\""]
["08:11,720","08:18,060","\"just sucks but the guy was like super pretentious too. Comedy machinima is low\""]
["08:18,060","08:23,980","\"art. This homage to something that is generally accepted as smart will\""]
["08:23,980","08:29,120","\"therefore be smart yes I love how creepy everyone in this game looks\""]
["08:29,120","08:32,940","\"mmm everyone just looks like a weird Russian dude I worried but they look\""]
["08:32,940","08:40,060","\"pretty good for 2004 they still look pretty okay it's okay it's way better\""]

["08:57,220","08:59,300","\"- Did you ever play with one of those on the playground?\""]
["08:59,300","09:01,740","\"- I've never seen one of these as a tic-tac-toe.\""]
["09:01,740","09:03,020","\"- It's like the most half-assed thing\""]
["09:03,020","09:04,220","\"you can stick in a playground,\""]
["09:04,220","09:06,620","\"just like a machine that automates\""]
["09:06,620","09:09,180","\"the very arduous process of tic-tac-toe.\""]
["09:09,180","09:11,700","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:11,700","09:12,940","\"- Go, go, go, go, go.\""]
["09:12,940","09:15,420","\"- See, this is a fucking great game.\""]
["09:15,420","09:16,260","\"- If only there were children.\""]
["09:16,260","09:18,740","\"- Can you jump on that and launch yourself?\""]
["09:18,740","09:19,780","\"- Oh, whoa.\""]
["09:19,780","09:21,220","\"- I was gonna say Gordon's not allowed\""]
["09:21,220","09:23,260","\"to get this close to a playground, I thought.\""]
["09:23,260","09:24,860","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:24,860","09:26,160","\"- This is all he can do.\""]
["09:26,160","09:29,260","\"This is why.\""]
["09:29,260","09:32,660","\"You know what, that's a good backstory.\""]
["09:32,660","09:34,140","\"They're like, you're not allowed to go\""]
["09:34,140","09:35,420","\"within 50 feet of a playground\""]
["09:35,420","09:36,980","\"'cause this is what he does.\""]
["09:36,980","09:38,940","\"He hurts himself and then he's on the register\""]
["09:38,940","09:40,780","\"because of that, but everyone thinks he's on the--\""]

["09:48,180","09:49,340","\"I've never actually looked up here before.\""]
["09:49,340","09:50,180","\"- There's gotta be something\""]
["09:50,180","09:51,580","\"really important over here.\""]

["09:52,500","09:56,220","\"What is this alien thing?\""]
["09:56,220","09:59,220","\"Is it supposed to be like a retina scanner?\""]
["09:59,220","10:00,660","\"That's a wiener scanner.\""]
["10:00,660","10:04,100","\"Yeah, they put their dicks in it and it's like if we recognize...\""]
["10:04,100","10:10,060","\"It's foreskin biometrics to go to circle back to that.\""]
["10:10,060","10:12,180","\"Every foreskin is like a snowflake.\""]
["10:12,180","10:13,740","\"None of them are the same.\""]
["10:13,740","10:18,020","\"So all the resistance fighters are circumcised so they can't have their foreskin's red.\""]
["10:18,020","10:19,100","\"Exactly.\""]
["10:19,100","10:22,100","\"-Like sanding off your finger.\""]
["10:22,100","10:24,100","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:24,100","10:26,100","\"Apparently that doesn't even fucking work.\""]
["10:26,100","10:28,100","\"-No, you can't lose your fingerprints. -No.\""]
["10:28,100","10:30,100","\"-I thought you can burn them off with acid.\""]
["10:30,100","10:31,100","\"-No, they grow back.\""]
["10:31,100","10:34,100","\"-Well, they do grow back, but they'll stay off for a bit.\""]
["10:34,100","10:35,100","\"-For like a minute.\""]
["10:35,100","10:40,100","\"-I feel like having horribly scarred fingertips,\""]
["10:40,100","10:43,100","\"and then it's like, oh, a crime was committed by somebody\""]
["10:43,100","10:47,100","\"with horribly scarred fingertips would maybe narrow it down\""]
["10:47,100","10:49,100","\"Yeah, possibly more even.\""]
["10:49,100","10:56,000","\"You must see if they didn't have anything in a registry, but someone just happened to see your mangled fingertips.\""]
["10:56,000","10:56,500","\"Oh.\""]
["10:56,500","10:57,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:57,000","10:58,000","\"I thought you were a cop.\""]
["10:58,000","11:01,000","\"They thought you were a cop because you were throwing it all around.\""]
["11:01,000","11:03,000","\"You'd be clear when you're behaving just like one.\""]
["11:03,000","11:04,200","\"He'll be coming for us next.\""]

["11:09,000","11:11,400","\"What am I doing?\""]
["11:11,400","11:13,300","\"You need to clear that out.\""]
["11:13,300","11:14,400","\"I mean, probably not.\""]
["11:14,400","11:15,400","\"Or do I.\""]
["11:15,400","11:20,400","\"- I'm gonna go bro, bro. - You're gonna take it anymore.\""]
