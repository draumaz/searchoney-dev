["00:27,400","00:28,600","\"What is this game about?\""]
["00:28,600","00:35,320","\"I think this game is about a pencil whose character arc involves becoming calm and collected.\""]
["00:35,320","00:38,680","\"He learns the value of monogamy.\""]
["00:38,680","00:41,600","\"He learns the value of erasing people from his life.\""]

["01:55,700","02:21,580","\"It's not motion capture. How did they rig his face? Well, this looks different\""]
["02:21,580","02:26,580","\"theCynicalWeeb is the best game I've ever had in my life.\""]

["03:46,680","03:48,680","\"Oh, it is the same song.\""]
["03:48,680","03:51,680","\"This music would probably sound fine with like a real guitar.\""]

["05:59,580","06:05,020","\"If you showed them in the eraser way, it wouldn't hurt so bad. Yeah, we'd probably feel pretty good wiggle it around like that\""]
["06:05,020","06:07,900","\"Just keep you taking so much damage\""]
["06:07,900","06:17,420","\"Excuse well, can you draw? Oh, yeah, look you have power-ups. That was that power up. I hate it\""]

["06:26,060","06:28,780","\"He's just took like 50 damage off of you.\""]
["06:28,780","06:34,000","\"If you know the extent of the controls of this game, if you're the one playing it, you get to see just how stinky it is.\""]

["06:35,680","06:36,540","\"Oh, you did it.\""]

["07:22,740","07:27,540","\"We can't release this how much money did it make so by the way you're nice to stars\""]
["07:27,540","07:30,620","\"Nobody even knows about this game. I didn't mean any money\""]
["07:30,620","07:31,980","\"So here's real guitars now\""]
["07:31,980","07:37,380","\"I mean you were saying that there's no playthroughs of this on YouTube right now. No one has played through this game as\""]
["07:37,380","07:43,020","\"In nobody has finished it or nobody's recorded anything about what's this level is the furthest?\""]
["07:43,020","07:48,540","\"I've ever seen anyone get really I've beaten the game, but I'm probably the only one this game is awful\""]
["07:48,540","07:51,140","\"I'm the only person history that be while woody\""]
["07:51,140","07:54,140","\"How do you feel about that fact?\""]
["07:54,140","07:55,140","\"Uh...\""]
["07:55,140","07:56,140","\"Is that something you're proud of?\""]
["07:56,140","07:57,140","\"No.\""]
["07:57,140","08:01,140","\"Are you happy that this is what you do with your time?\""]
["08:01,140","08:04,140","\"By the way, these mushrooms only ground hurt you for whatever reason.\""]
["08:04,140","08:05,140","\"Because they're pulsing.\""]
["08:05,140","08:06,140","\"There's no...\""]
["08:06,140","08:07,140","\"Well, these too.\""]
["08:07,140","08:09,140","\"There's no indication those hurt you.\""]
["08:09,140","08:10,140","\"They're poison.\""]
["08:10,140","08:11,140","\"You just find out.\""]
["08:11,140","08:12,140","\"You're the poison mushroom zone.\""]

["08:40,660","08:46,480","\"I wow good the question why I mean that's the only thing they probably came up\""]
["08:46,480","08:49,640","\"with to the plot makes no sense that has nothing to do with it\""]
["08:49,640","08:53,600","\"yeah i know that's why i think i think i think i think we have a game about\""]
["08:53,600","08:57,120","\"pencil why do we have a game about pencil how does that work i don't know\""]
["08:57,120","08:58,520","\"his name is wild woody\""]
["08:58,520","09:03,640","\"i thought i'm pole brought into life even could have been a wild eraser boy\""]
["09:03,640","09:06,480","\"he could have been a racer head was the eraser head video game\""]
["09:06,480","09:09,080","\"i'd be pretty happy if there was an eraser head game what if it's starting\""]
["09:09,080","09:12,080","\"wild woody though even if it was i don't care even if it was like a really\""]
["09:12,080","09:15,680","\"bad alternate universe where it's about wild if it was a really bad game i'd\""]
["09:15,680","09:21,280","\"I'd still be happy if it was David Lynch's eraser head I'd probably be pleased with it.\""]
["09:21,280","09:23,280","\"But it's wild woody taking care of the baby.\""]
["09:23,280","09:25,680","\"It could be completely the wrong thing.\""]
["09:25,680","09:32,080","\"It could be like a JRPG where he's fighting monsters or something with a giant sword,\""]
["09:32,080","09:33,880","\"and I'd still be happy.\""]
["09:33,880","09:35,680","\"Can we have a disclaimer in this episode?\""]
["09:35,680","09:37,280","\"With a disclaimer, Chris.\""]
["09:37,280","09:42,480","\"If we're not in our top form today, it's because we all ate horrible food and made it sick.\""]
["09:42,480","09:45,480","\"It seems like every place that delivers to the office.\""]
["09:45,480","09:47,480","\"Yeah, it makes us sick.\""]
["09:47,480","09:49,480","\"But this is like the worst that ever felt.\""]
["09:49,480","09:53,480","\"How are you supposed to do that?\""]
["09:53,480","09:55,480","\"I don't know when it's not hurting you.\""]
["09:55,480","09:57,480","\"There you go.\""]
["09:57,480","10:01,480","\"It's okay. I got the really bad control down.\""]
["10:01,480","10:03,480","\"Seriously, feel it. Try playing it for a second.\""]
["10:03,480","10:07,480","\"Please, for a second, just feel how this controls.\""]
["10:07,480","10:09,480","\"This level has good music.\""]
["10:09,480","10:11,480","\"Come on.\""]
["10:11,480","10:13,480","\"Isn't that weird though?\""]
["10:13,480","10:18,120","\"Oh my god, sometimes he just doesn't jive I was telling you it's it's true\""]
["10:18,120","10:24,960","\"You need to feel it to understand how bad the controls are what he's so wild. What's he gonna do next? Let me just find a\""]
["10:24,960","10:30,640","\"I mean a\""]
["10:30,640","10:38,000","\"Like the eraser thing it would make sense if it was like oh he goes into like maybe like other sketchbooks or something or like\""]
["10:38,000","10:42,680","\"No into notebooks, but he's going into like printed books and you can't erase\""]
["10:42,680","10:47,960","\"no you can't there is no indication of what you can erase it looks just like\""]
["10:47,960","10:51,480","\"everything else I only know where stuff is because I've been this before\""]
["10:51,480","10:56,680","\"that's it and even then I remember one time when I was playing race I got stuck\""]
["10:56,680","11:00,080","\"in a hole for probably 10 minutes straight because there's something you're\""]
["11:00,080","11:03,480","\"supposed to erase but it doesn't tell you what so it's just me guessing and you\""]
["11:03,480","11:08,080","\"have to be oh by the way wait let me see if I can line up with it if you uh\""]
["11:08,080","11:12,560","\"you can kind of see it if you hit like the side of a lead you clip off of it\""]
["11:12,560","11:17,800","\"weird yeah so you probably grabbing these sucks because I don't even know\""]
["11:17,800","11:22,000","\"how you're supposed to jump off of it Jesus Christ there that was what I was\""]
["11:22,000","11:26,600","\"trying to show if you hit the very ledge of a platform like that happens on\""]
["11:26,600","11:32,060","\"every platform in the game he'll just get stuck in the corner of it and this\""]
["11:32,060","11:36,000","\"was Sega of America they've made these games before they have made platformers\""]
["11:36,000","11:40,400","\"I don't know why this game what else did they do it's like the fucking one of\""]

["11:50,100","11:52,100","\"There is no indication of that.\""]
["11:52,100","11:55,400","\"You just have to guess that that one pixels where you do it.\""]
["11:55,400","11:58,400","\"Also, no, they didn't spend money on the music.\""]
["11:58,400","12:00,800","\"The guy who did the music for this hadn't interviewed and said like,\""]

["12:04,200","12:07,200","\"I guess for a month he did a pretty good job.\""]

["12:57,060","12:59,060","\"Let me show you the best mechanic in this game.\""]
["12:59,060","13:03,060","\"So all those little notepads I picked up, you get power-ups.\""]
["13:03,060","13:04,060","\"Uh-huh.\""]
["13:04,060","13:08,060","\"So, uh, now I have a king to rule.\""]
["13:08,060","13:13,060","\"Except it controls like shit and I'm a disappearist.\""]
["13:13,060","13:17,060","\"But look, every time you do a drawing, you get a little bit shorter.\""]
["13:17,060","13:18,060","\"And you can do it.\""]
["13:18,060","13:19,060","\"Does that mean you can't jump far?\""]
["13:19,060","13:22,060","\"You can draw two things and then you can't draw anymore.\""]
["13:22,060","13:24,060","\"But it means I can get a little bit higher up.\""]
["13:24,060","13:32,060","\"So if I do another one like this, it means I can actually jump from there now.\""]
["13:32,060","13:34,060","\"But uh also\""]
["13:34,060","13:39,460","\"You know how you do that compared to just a little jump you hold up and jump for a reason\""]
["13:39,460","13:44,260","\"They don't explain any of this to you. It's not intuitive in any way. That's intuitive. Oh\""]
["13:44,260","13:49,260","\"Oh god Jesus fuck is it always bouncing? I\""]
["13:49,260","13:55,900","\"Never mind. I was gonna let you feel like he's a little man. He's really pissed off\""]

["14:32,640","14:35,280","\"It dumps you directly on something that's gonna. Of course it does\""]
["14:35,280","14:40,040","\"That's everything in this game. There's no structure to these levels. It's just a mess\""]
["14:40,040","14:44,080","\"And you're supposed to figure out how to walk through it. Are they using the same sound fawns as shinobi?\""]
["14:44,080","14:50,180","\"We're gonna die. Oh, yeah, he's gonna kill me when you rub people out it sounds like a door opening in shinobi\""]

["15:18,880","15:24,440","\"Oh, okay, Woody. I was kidding. I know I like the music in shinobi, but it is dumb. You gotta admit no\""]
["15:24,440","15:29,660","\"It's really stupid, but that's why it's a fun game. Yeah, it doesn't take itself serious. It's really hard. Yes\""]
["15:29,660","15:30,560","\"It is\""]
["15:30,560","15:34,700","\"That's why I was surprised you wanted to play it. You should beat it. Oh, okay, Woody. I\""]
