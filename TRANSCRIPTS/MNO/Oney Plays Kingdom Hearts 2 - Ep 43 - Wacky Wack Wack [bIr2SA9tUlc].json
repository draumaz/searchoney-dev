["03:28,780","03:36,340","\"And hold down X to get a power build up in your first jump. How about so this is like who gets the baby to roll the farthest?\""]
["03:36,340","03:39,880","\"No, whichever babies had is more deformed by the end of the fall\""]
["03:39,880","03:45,880","\"Maybe something like hole in the wall, but it's like a baby falling down a shaft and you have to rotate the baby to fit through the holes\""]
["03:45,880","03:50,520","\"I would like that. That'd be fun. You'd have different shape babies\""]

["04:46,060","04:51,820","\"I think she's the worst part of the whole show. I think we've concluded every discussion now. I'm Rugrats after that\""]
["04:53,820","04:56,540","\"Really don't like Kimmy. I don't like Dell either\""]

["05:57,360","06:01,400","\"That's true. I feel like it would be in character for him to not care\""]
["06:01,400","06:07,520","\"He grew up to be a mess didn't he? Mm-hmm. I mean, I don't know how you don't with that family\""]
["06:07,520","06:10,500","\"It's true\""]
