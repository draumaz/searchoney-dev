["00:04,360","00:05,520","\"With friends.\""]
["00:05,520","00:08,280","\"Welcome to God of War with Lyle and Tomar.\""]
["00:08,280","00:08,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:08,840","00:09,360","\"Hey.\""]
["00:09,360","00:09,800","\"Uh...\""]
["00:09,800","00:10,480","\"Tomar.\""]
["00:10,480","00:11,400","\"Hi, I'm...\""]
["00:11,400","00:13,000","\"No, I'm Tomar.\""]
["00:13,000","00:14,080","\"Oh, this is right.\""]
["00:14,080","00:16,080","\"I mean, I'm Lyle.\""]
["00:16,080","00:18,080","\"I'm Lyle and that's Tomar.\""]
["00:18,080","00:20,960","\"Anyways, uh, we're playing this...\""]
["00:20,960","00:26,200","\"Ding Dong Julian are dealing with a broken laptop, so we're doing this while they fix it.\""]
["00:26,200","00:26,680","\"Uh...\""]
["00:26,680","00:27,160","\"Broken heart.\""]
["00:27,160","00:28,160","\"Gonna play a little God of War?\""]
["00:28,160","00:29,000","\"\"\"Goddle soul.\"\"\""]
["00:29,000","00:30,600","\"Do you wanna play God very hard?\""]
["00:30,600","00:32,940","\"I wasn't just doing normal, let's just make it a shot.\""]
["00:32,940","00:37,880","\"Too normal, this is gonna be a walk in the Spartan Park.\""]
["00:37,880","00:41,900","\"I haven't played this since it first came out and I...\""]
["00:41,900","00:42,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:42,400","00:45,960","\"It's really weird how you remember stuff looking so much better when you first played it.\""]
["00:45,960","00:46,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:46,620","00:48,300","\"I mean this was originally on the PS2.\""]
["00:48,300","00:50,960","\"I guess this is a remaster technically.\""]
["00:50,960","00:51,460","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:51,460","00:57,240","\"But all the original videos were probably like highly compressed and I don't know if they really had like masters of them.\""]
["00:57,240","00:57,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:57,740","01:03,700","\"I also really like I firmly believe that with a lot of these games and you see like the old polygons\""]
["01:03,700","01:05,220","\"but in\""]
["01:05,220","01:11,300","\"Full HD on like a like a big TV. It makes them look kind of weird whereas they might actually look worse than they\""]
["01:11,300","01:16,340","\"Yeah, I feel like the low resolution kind of smears it out, you know, like then those rocks\""]
["01:16,340","01:19,660","\"You can see all the polygons on them. It looks cool though\""]
["01:19,660","01:26,700","\"You can see how his shoulder joints are not in any way connected to his torso. Oh jeez. Yeah, wow\""]
["01:26,700","01:27,540","\"Wow.\""]
["01:27,540","01:30,740","\"- Oh my God, I remember this looking.\""]
["01:30,740","01:32,500","\"- Yeah, that's definitely pre-rendered.\""]
["01:32,500","01:34,660","\"That looked way worse than the game.\""]
["01:34,660","01:35,660","\"- It just snapped out.\""]
["01:35,660","01:37,580","\"- But that's the thing, at the time it happened,\""]
["01:37,580","01:39,780","\"they pre-rendered it because it probably looked better\""]
["01:39,780","01:41,860","\"than the in-game graphics,\""]
["01:41,860","01:44,180","\"but how it actually looked substantially worse.\""]
["01:44,180","01:47,300","\"- Did most people even have a HDTV back then?\""]
["01:47,300","01:48,500","\"- I don't think so.\""]
["01:48,500","01:49,860","\"- I needed it, didn't that?\""]
["01:49,860","01:50,700","\"- Did it?\""]
["01:50,700","01:55,020","\"- The PS2, I think was before HDTVs were common,\""]
["01:55,020","01:56,220","\"or maybe even before they were--\""]
["01:56,220","01:59,580","\"You know what? You're right. Dead Rising was the first HD game I ever saw.\""]
["01:59,580","02:03,020","\"\"\"Dad, you've got a strain.\"\"\""]
["02:03,020","02:08,060","\"\"\"You've got to feel like you're really pulling on a great...\"\"\""]
["02:08,060","02:12,500","\"\"\"And so, Kratos feels like it, and then he just casually flings it like it's nothing.\"\"\""]
["02:12,500","02:13,660","\"\"\"Hm?\"\"\""]
["02:13,660","02:16,660","\"\"\"Is this game considered a classic now?\"\"\""]
["02:16,660","02:17,900","\"\"\"Uh, I mean...\"\"\""]
["02:17,900","02:18,660","\"\"\"I think so.\"\"\""]
["02:18,660","02:21,060","\"\"\"Sony of America would probably call it that.\"\"\""]
["02:21,060","02:23,260","\"\"\"They would probably like to, wouldn't they?\"\"\""]
["02:24,300","02:27,900","\"No, this game definitely has history. I mean yeah, I mean for sure\""]
["02:27,900","02:32,640","\"They're even like doing a new God of War now with the like beard beard crados\""]
["02:32,640","02:39,540","\"When I've been your opinions on that till Mars. I think beards were a good choice. I mean you would\""]
["02:39,540","02:46,340","\"I agree with you. I mean I feel like like it's they're definitely trying to be like hey\""]
["02:46,340","02:52,860","\"What have God of War met the last of us and we could do this whole sympathy for a helpless child angle?\""]
["02:52,860","02:59,960","\"So I mean that that part feels transparent but that alone that doesn't make it a bad game or a bad choice\""]
["02:59,960","03:01,960","\"That's just\""]
["03:01,960","03:07,680","\"Is a thing that they're doing? I don't know. I don't know if that works for God of War honestly\""]
["03:07,680","03:09,880","\"I don't know if God of War is supposed to have a heart to it\""]
["03:09,880","03:15,880","\"Like didn't you play God of War 3 or at the end of God of War 3 hope saves everyone?\""]
["03:15,880","03:20,520","\"I don't think I ever played three. I played it the hell out of one and two\""]
["03:20,720","03:26,800","\"Yeah, three three has like this really bullshit ending where it's like the power was\""]
["03:26,800","03:31,880","\"Yeah, you the whole time and it was hope it was like there you go. Yeah mash him up\""]
["03:31,880","03:39,160","\"It was quick time events are no match for you Chris. I can identify shapes\""]
["03:39,160","03:43,880","\"It fucking hate this shit. This is the one thing I don't like I\""]
["03:43,880","03:49,040","\"Think it works in God of War just because it's sort of baked into the design of the game\""]
["03:49,040","03:55,060","\"You kind of all what always know when it's coming. I think you like initiate it. This is the best part of God of War right here\""]
["03:55,060","03:57,800","\"The rafts sailing on\""]
["03:57,800","04:04,540","\"long rafters look at him go. He's trying to try to fall off. He's weird. Oh, okay, all right. He's weirdly nimble\""]
["04:04,540","04:07,520","\"But he grabs on oh, he did a little dive\""]
["04:07,520","04:10,720","\"I think it's an interesting choice to give like a big buff dude\""]
["04:10,720","04:17,100","\"To two knives instead of like a giant hammer a huge like cloud sword or something because they could have easily\""]
["04:17,200","04:22,980","\"Yeah, I've gone that direction. I mean you the whole idea of the of the extended knives on chains\""]
["04:22,980","04:27,040","\"I think was to be like we want something where you can just mash your mash your controller\""]
["04:27,040","04:31,460","\"And you will constantly be hitting everything and it looks cool. It does look cool\""]
["04:31,460","04:33,820","\"I think it was a it was a solid choice at the time\""]
["04:33,820","04:39,300","\"Huh at least for what this game was trying to do the boats look at them eat those polygon\""]
["04:39,300","04:42,840","\"Are you trying to get out that way? I don't think so. Oh no, there you go\""]
["04:45,240","04:47,240","\"Okay stay away\""]
["04:47,240","04:56,060","\"Spoiler alert you kill that man three times. Yeah, that's right at the course of the series right yeah in every single game\""]
["04:56,060","04:59,020","\"You kill him the subsequent time like you go\""]
["04:59,020","05:01,440","\"I think you might actually kill him twice in this game\""]
["05:01,440","05:03,920","\"I feel like he's a running game\""]
["05:03,920","05:10,380","\"Yeah, because you go to you go to Hades in like every game and you kill this guy after you kill him here\""]
["05:10,380","05:16,800","\"That's right multiple times so like because one time he was kind of a shithead and closed a door on you\""]
["05:16,800","05:19,700","\"Just fucking murder in three times\""]
["05:19,700","05:26,020","\"Yo, is the um you can kill me god. It's harpies for like no reason fucking wrap these guys\""]
["05:26,020","05:30,020","\"You just like got them for no reason. I love harpies. You're a one of the running dudes\""]
["05:30,020","05:33,180","\"Okay, it's it's like unnecessarily mean\""]
["05:33,180","05:39,540","\"There's no reason but you get it like rewards you directly for doing that. That's fun\""]
["05:39,540","05:44,680","\"I know I like it well that was my point kind of war was never a game that was supposed to be about hard\""]
["05:44,680","05:48,400","\"It was supposed to be a game about just like and that's ruthless war word\""]
["05:48,400","05:53,520","\"Doing that's what I hate that the new one fair new one is like I'm taking care of my son\""]
["05:53,520","05:58,840","\"I love him very much isn't he isn't he more like kill this deer looking in the eye and kill it\""]
["05:58,840","06:04,720","\"This is like but dad I will have no son of mine be a pussy. I want to be an artist\""]
["06:05,720","06:13,480","\"If I see you dry go break all your fingers, okay, you fucking ask fucker. I'll give you one singular finger\""]
["06:13,480","06:18,320","\"And you can curl it toward your chest and be like me son\""]
["06:18,320","06:22,640","\"Singular finger. It's a good bad name\""]
["06:22,640","06:26,560","\"Yeah, I dig it there he is\""]
["06:26,560","06:33,280","\"You got a mash I like that that's fun. Yeah, that's awesome\""]
["06:33,280","06:38,880","\"I don't know. I have never really had a problem with quick time events. I know that it's cool to shit on them\""]
["06:38,880","06:45,160","\"But I really haven't I mean sometimes they're done really horrendously, but I've never on principle just hated them\""]
["06:45,160","06:50,240","\"Yeah, I think I think they've been used poorly, but you know they are what they are\""]
["06:50,240","06:55,880","\"They let you they let you add like tension to a cinematic part of the game and they let you your care\""]
["06:55,880","07:02,280","\"Fuck you something that's not and it's like normal repertoire of moves. Yeah, well while still like making it feel like\""]
["07:02,280","07:09,480","\"Like at the time God of War came out, the idea of having all these like contextual things you could do actually was pretty cool.\""]
["07:09,480","07:14,840","\"I need to stop saying shit like that. I sound like a dinosaur.\""]
["07:14,840","07:16,040","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:16,040","07:17,880","\"Just not that back in my day.\""]
["07:17,880","07:20,840","\"Back in my day, we didn't have polygons.\""]
["07:20,840","07:23,000","\"We didn't have context sensitive action.\""]
["07:23,000","07:24,040","\"Oh god.\""]
["07:24,040","07:26,280","\"Greek mythology is super cool in itself.\""]
["07:26,280","07:31,000","\"It really is and everybody fucks everything and the main dude turns himself into a cow.\""]
["07:31,480","07:34,680","\"And the gods act how gods would act if there were gods.\""]
["07:34,680","07:37,160","\"- You know right, just complete Creighton's.\""]
["07:37,160","07:38,000","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:38,000","07:40,480","\"Super cool.\""]
["07:40,480","07:41,480","\"Don't bite me, you fucking-\""]
["07:41,480","07:42,320","\"- That's interesting.\""]
["07:42,320","07:47,320","\"- I wonder if like the guy who like writes it.\""]
["07:47,320","07:49,720","\"We can say this about Greek mythology, right?\""]
["07:49,720","07:51,440","\"Like it's clearly somebody wrote it.\""]
["07:51,440","07:53,040","\"We went to the top of the mountain.\""]
["07:53,040","07:54,600","\"There's no dudes there.\""]
["07:54,600","07:56,320","\"- Yeah, there's no gods up on all of this.\""]
["07:56,320","08:00,040","\"- We can definitively say that one some dude made up.\""]
["08:00,040","08:01,360","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:01,360","08:04,640","\"So like when it comes to the dude who made that up,\""]
["08:04,640","08:06,840","\"like why was he just like fucking,\""]
["08:06,840","08:11,080","\"okay, the water dude, he likes horses\""]
["08:11,080","08:15,440","\"and he fucking every time you tell a lie,\""]
["08:15,440","08:17,960","\"he makes your daughter infertile.\""]
["08:17,960","08:20,480","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:20,480","08:23,800","\"Did that guy like try to kind of scholarly figure out\""]
["08:23,800","08:26,880","\"like an educated guess or did he just fucking--\""]
["08:26,880","08:30,000","\"- What if it was just a guy who lived on Mount Olympus\""]
["08:30,000","08:33,600","\"and wanted to make sure nobody came up there and bothered.\""]
["08:33,600","08:35,840","\"So initially he just made up this story about like,\""]
["08:35,840","08:38,040","\"yeah, there's gods up there and they'll mess you up.\""]
["08:38,040","08:41,080","\"If you ever go, that's a holy place, you can't go up there.\""]
["08:41,080","08:43,200","\"And then people really bought into it and he's like,\""]
["08:43,200","08:48,200","\"man, I could turn this into a profitable business somehow.\""]
["08:48,200","08:50,040","\"- Yeah, but I mean, like he wasn't the guy.\""]
["08:50,040","08:51,400","\"There's a few things where like,\""]
["08:51,400","08:54,000","\"there's a guy involved, you know?\""]
["08:54,000","08:57,520","\"And whenever there's like a guy involved,\""]
["08:57,520","08:59,320","\"there's a certain one I'm going out of my way,\""]
["08:59,320","09:00,160","\"- Not to mention.\""]
["09:00,160","09:00,980","\"- No.\""]
["09:00,980","09:01,820","\"- How do you,\""]
["09:01,820","09:03,680","\"- As like a guy involved in a religion,\""]
["09:03,680","09:05,760","\"you gotta think like, okay, this dude,\""]
["09:05,760","09:07,960","\"this dude made profit and heavily from like,\""]
["09:07,960","09:09,320","\"- How do you please stuff that up?\""]
["09:09,320","09:10,160","\"- Like he,\""]
["09:10,160","09:12,400","\"- Like he knew the gods, but with Mount Olympus,\""]
["09:12,400","09:14,360","\"I don't think there was ever like a dude,\""]
["09:14,360","09:17,200","\"like a real dude that walked around the earth\""]
["09:17,200","09:20,400","\"in that religion, so.\""]
["09:20,400","09:21,760","\"- I mean, but they had these like.\""]
["09:21,760","09:22,600","\"- They're gonna write,\""]
["09:22,600","09:23,800","\"they did have the heroes.\""]
["09:23,800","09:26,440","\"- They had priestesses and they had like,\""]
["09:26,440","09:28,660","\"They had like, what do they call them?\""]
["09:28,660","09:29,920","\"Oracles, yeah.\""]
["09:29,920","09:30,920","\"- I mean, was a--\""]
["09:30,920","09:33,720","\"- And these people all got like crazy offerings\""]
["09:33,720","09:36,720","\"to do whatever it was that they did for a living.\""]
["09:36,720","09:37,560","\"- That's true.\""]
["09:37,560","09:42,560","\"Like we're, like the fucking ankle guy, the Achilles.\""]
["09:42,560","09:43,800","\"- Yeah, yeah.\""]
["09:43,800","09:45,440","\"Was he like a real dude?\""]
["09:45,440","09:48,360","\"Obviously the invincible except for his heel thing.\""]
["09:48,360","09:51,960","\"That's not real, but was he like a real guy that was like,\""]
["09:51,960","09:53,080","\"oh yeah, I'm toned.\""]
["09:53,080","09:55,320","\"Every part of me is invincible except my heel.\""]
["09:55,320","09:56,160","\"Fuck me.\""]
["09:56,160","10:00,920","\"I feel like he didn't even mention that part until after it happened.\""]
["10:00,920","10:03,600","\"He's like, \"\"Oh, yeah, you know, he got my heel.\""]
["10:03,600","10:07,640","\"It happened to be my one weakness.\"\"\""]
["10:07,640","10:09,400","\"Make sure you write that down.\""]
