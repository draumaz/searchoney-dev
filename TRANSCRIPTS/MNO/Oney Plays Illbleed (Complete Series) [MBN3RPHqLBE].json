["41:58,480","42:00,480","\"That's his problem\""]
["42:00,480","42:04,780","\"Well, we'll give them an assistant monkey to help them up and stuff\""]
["42:04,780","42:10,060","\"Yeah, give them an extending boxing glove. We'll give them a little nursing monkey that wears a little nurse hat and dress\""]
["42:10,060","42:15,000","\"She'll help me now. This is just like a little miniature hovering space station type thing\""]
["42:15,000","42:20,340","\"It's okay, so we'll they look down and we'll pay for four balloons and hang a little like monkey house in the center\""]
["42:20,340","42:23,800","\"Just make a monkey village. That's hovering. Okay. That's fine\""]
["42:23,800","42:27,880","\"And then what we can like leave it for like 700 years and then come back to see how they're all doing yeah\""]
["42:27,880","42:35,400","\"Chris. How much money does this need? I think around 40 million dollars. I think about\""]

["43:14,840","43:19,180","\"We need a little TV for them, computer.\""]

["43:24,220","43:25,560","\"Can we get them like a grappling hook\""]
