["00:23,540","00:26,320","\"- You wanna, it's your decision as to whether you call an ambulance,\""]
["00:26,320","00:29,220","\"or if you just make a break for it, or what.\""]
["00:29,220","00:30,220","\"Hmm\""]
["00:30,220","00:37,920","\"He says don't go stay for me if he came and smiled. I'd be really really upset like I'd assume he knew who I was\""]
["00:37,920","00:43,640","\"And then I'd probably try and restrain him. Okay, I'd take off my name\""]
["00:43,640","00:46,760","\"I'd take off my t-shirt use my keys to slice it into a\""]
