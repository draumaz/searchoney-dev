["00:03,040","00:05,220","\"*sigh* With friends.\""]
["00:05,220","00:07,520","\"See Julian, this is a prophecy story.\""]
["00:07,520","00:09,920","\"To the land of the ancient lords.\""]
["00:09,920","00:13,760","\"Which are bad kinds of stories, but this game gets away with it. You know why?\""]
["00:13,760","00:16,320","\"Because it's nonsense.\""]
["00:16,320","00:18,200","\"Oh, because I too did not speak.\""]
["00:18,200","00:20,000","\"*sigh*\""]
["00:20,000","00:24,200","\"I mean, to my knowledge, people don't really care about the story in these games, right?\""]
["00:24,200","00:26,220","\"No, no, no, no. Oh boy.\""]
["00:26,220","00:27,040","\"Do they not?\""]
["00:27,040","00:27,880","\"The story.\""]
["00:27,880","00:28,720","\"- Or do they?\""]
["00:28,720","00:30,640","\"- They love. - They have a lot of amazing story.\""]
["00:30,640","00:31,620","\"- Okay.\""]
["00:31,620","00:32,720","\"I never hear anybody talk about it.\""]
["00:32,720","00:34,080","\"- It's always been a game.\""]
["00:34,080","00:36,720","\"- There's like a million channels dedicated.\""]
["00:36,720","00:38,480","\"- And they're really popular.\""]
["00:38,480","00:41,680","\"- It's 'cause it's not all just directly handed to you.\""]
["00:41,680","00:42,520","\"- Yeah.\""]
["00:42,520","00:43,640","\"- Just reading item descriptions\""]
["00:43,640","00:45,840","\"and everything you can piece things together.\""]
["00:45,840","00:47,440","\"- That probably is the best way to do it.\""]
["00:47,440","00:48,280","\"- It is for games.\""]
["00:48,280","00:49,480","\"It's the perfect way to do it.\""]
["00:49,480","00:52,120","\"- Like it's easy to accidentally skip over,\""]
["00:52,120","00:54,760","\"but it ends up being the most effective if you're invested.\""]
["00:54,760","00:55,880","\"- No, it's awesome.\""]
["00:55,880","00:59,680","\"You have to pay attention to what you're doing and your surroundings and everything makes sense usually\""]
["00:59,680","01:05,320","\"I'm gonna try and just get this really quick item down here. I think the game a little easier\""]
["01:05,320","01:08,280","\"Look Julian\""]
["01:08,280","01:13,180","\"Sewer that's very pretty pretty sewer seems really big\""]

["01:19,880","01:30,720","\"I like that because I can picture you doing it in real life.\""]
["01:30,720","01:33,220","\"Fuck you.\""]
["01:33,220","01:35,160","\"Oh, God.\""]
