Why can't I use another elixir? You can't. What? It wouldn't let you use it. It's a grayed out. I guess I only let you use one. What did you think of that picture? I accidentally took with my dog's asshole. It was very meaty looking. It was very deliberate.\""]
["00:57,340","01:02,760","\"No, it was it was not I swear to God. I was sitting in bed trying to send a snap and I actually took a picture\""]

["01:31,960","01:37,920","\"that Juliet, I think there's a problem. Well, even then, so hard. Could try a different\""]
["01:37,920","01:44,480","\"one. I could try like the earlier introduced ones. Okay, maybe those will be at a slightly\""]
["01:44,480","01:48,680","\"lower difficulty level. I think it's a little weird that these non-canon fights just sort\""]
["01:48,680","01:53,480","\"of appear here in the main game like that. Because I would if this was my first time\""]
["01:53,480","01:56,920","\"playing I would assume that's tied to the storyline in some way here that I\""]
["01:56,920","02:00,600","\"wasn't revisiting something from Chain of Memories. Yeah, where's the closest\""]

["02:27,760","02:28,760","\"Were there?\""]
["02:28,760","02:31,760","\"In the original release of the game, I mean, there was no secret.\""]
["02:31,760","02:33,760","\"Even- this does not count as a secret fight.\""]
["02:33,760","02:35,760","\"There's a glowing thing there.\""]
["02:35,760","02:39,760","\"I'm thinking of the way that Kurt Zisa you had to kind of find it accidentally.\""]
["02:39,760","02:42,760","\"Which was really cool, by the way, when you actually run into them.\""]
["02:42,760","02:45,760","\"I love when games put in something that you just-\""]
["02:45,760","02:50,280","\"just you probably definitely won't run into I like when they're really\""]
["02:50,280","02:53,760","\"intimidating when they appear the weapons and Final Fantasy 7 were fucking\""]
["02:53,760","02:57,200","\"terrifying yes little kid me too they were like the coolest things ever\""]
["02:57,200","03:00,520","\"and not emerald weapon underwater and then being put on the timer and\""]

["03:07,760","03:11,680","\"creatures that you can see walk into well especially when they're huge like\""]
["03:11,680","03:18,600","\"that because that's what makes them so intimidating. Why? Oh no. Goofy was in the book. He's\""]
["03:18,600","03:21,760","\"trapping your friends and books and now Goofy is being a goofball.\""]
["03:21,760","03:26,720","\"I love the way you can just see the little ruby weapons sticking out of the gold\""]
["03:26,720","03:29,960","\"saucer too. He has this little claw sticking out. Yeah.\""]
["03:29,960","03:33,920","\"I also love the sound they make. They like.\""]
["03:33,920","03:39,720","\"Have you seen those models like dumped by themselves because they look pretty good\""]
["03:39,720","03:40,920","\"for a PS1 model.\""]
["03:40,920","03:44,580","\"Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, my gosh.\""]
["03:44,580","03:47,520","\"You're in book land. Oh, this is what it's like to be a book.\""]
["03:47,520","03:49,480","\"I hate it. What the fuck?\""]
["03:49,480","03:51,320","\"This is why no one reads anymore.\""]

["03:54,520","03:57,320","\"Uh, let's keep turning the page.\""]
["03:57,320","04:00,020","\"That's cool. I think this is. Wow.\""]
["04:00,020","04:01,520","\"That was actually really cool.\""]
["04:01,520","04:05,720","\"Oh, all right. You broke his head.\""]
["04:05,720","04:08,120","\"That's where he keeps all of his knowledge.\""]
["04:08,120","04:10,320","\"-A little V. Julie? -It's going to fall out.\""]
["04:10,320","04:13,120","\"-What is his character now that you've killed him?\""]
["04:13,120","04:16,120","\"-Oh, fuck. What did he do?\""]
["04:16,120","04:20,120","\"I remember he had a fairly big role, so I should remember.\""]
["04:20,120","04:25,120","\"-He uses the sand as a litter box. -He researches, I guess.\""]
["04:25,120","04:28,120","\"-Can you unlock an axle book to fight axle?\""]
["04:28,120","04:31,120","\"-I wish I could unlock an axle-lodel.\""]
["04:31,120","04:32,120","\"-Wodel?\""]
["04:32,120","04:35,120","\"-Okay, I'm going to stop talking now.\""]
["04:35,120","04:37,400","\"I like Axel I would unlock him well no\""]
["04:37,400","04:44,000","\"I'm saying is there like one of those secret fights for him too like do they have one where it's a dedicated fight against him like the\""]
["04:44,000","04:46,400","\"End I don't think they do because he shows up at the end remember yeah\""]
["04:46,400","04:49,840","\"He does but I'm wondering if they have another one where they give him like more attacks or something\""]
["04:49,840","04:54,160","\"I'm trying to remember where else I've seen a fight and chain of memories isn't he like around the end?\""]
["04:54,160","04:59,340","\"There's one here. I always think that song is born free\""]
["04:59,340","05:02,320","\"As free as the one who is\""]
["05:03,800","05:05,800","\"Would you say the wind blows Chris?\""]
["05:05,800","05:08,680","\"Yeah, would you say the wind sucks?\""]
["05:08,680","05:14,160","\"That's a really good question. That's like is a happy question. I just thought up a stupid joke. No\""]
["05:14,160","05:18,980","\"It's good. It's good. The reason I ask is because Axel just wants to be remembered\""]
["05:18,980","05:25,160","\"But you have memories of everyone else but him because you have those little pop-ups to go back and fight them again. That's true\""]
["05:25,160","05:32,540","\"That's a little cruel, isn't it? How do you think Axel would feel if oh boy if he was a gigantic card if\""]
["05:32,540","05:34,540","\"Sora just didn't\""]
["05:34,540","05:37,020","\"Just a gigantic playing card there he is\""]
["05:37,020","05:40,300","\"That's pretty good\""]
["05:40,300","05:47,260","\"It remember we're watching the little PSAs at the end of power Rangers and they had to do the one on how the effects were not real\""]
["05:47,260","05:53,980","\"They show a girl turn into a cardboard cutout just like that and then a kid gets really scared goes oh\""]
["05:53,980","05:59,300","\"It has to go see it's just a practical effect. I wasn't actually\""]
["06:01,580","06:07,180","\"Every PSA that Power Rangers had was just about like trying to cover themselves so they wouldn't get sued\""]
["06:07,180","06:12,580","\"That is kind of a scary concept to get turned into like a flat paper thing. You've never done it before\""]
["06:12,580","06:14,580","\"I've never been flat paper now. Huh?\""]
["06:14,580","06:16,980","\"Yeah, you run over by a bulldozer. I\""]
["06:16,980","06:20,280","\"Don't want to do that a giant mallet\""]
["06:20,280","06:26,740","\"How about a shoe an anvil? I'd be down with a huge shoe. What did you got clobbered by a wrecking ball?\""]
["06:26,740","06:32,380","\"I remember the days when the the Monty Python foot would make me laugh hysterically\""]
["06:32,380","06:36,020","\"It makes a part\""]
["06:36,020","06:44,580","\"Fuck this great. Oh boy. There we go. I remember that she's gonna be tough. She's going to be hard\""]
["06:44,580","06:49,140","\"Not that it matters the toughy puff girls\""]
["06:49,140","06:55,980","\"It's the toughy puff girls. What are their names? Why did you say that like it's a B52 song? Oh?\""]
["06:56,220","06:58,220","\"You have\""]
["06:58,220","07:04,120","\"Did the B-52s ever do a so they did a song for Pokemon did they ever do a song they did for the powerpuff girls\""]
["07:04,120","07:06,120","\"They did meet the Flintstones\""]
["07:06,120","07:10,740","\"They were the what were they called? They had a name. I don't remember I\""]
["07:10,740","07:16,980","\"Was it the c-52s I want to say that makes sense. I only very very\""]
["07:16,980","07:24,700","\"Like barely remember the Flintstones movie because I saw it once and it was another one of those movies that was like really\""]
["07:25,060","07:28,340","\"needlessly sexual and it's made me uncomfortable.\""]
["07:28,340","07:34,780","\"That I, a lot of movies in my childhood, I feel like I had that feeling.\""]
["07:34,780","07:36,620","\"Oh my God, I was unprepared.\""]
["07:36,620","07:39,860","\"You have been ill prepared, Julian.\""]
["07:39,860","07:43,180","\"Which of these organization people are your favorite?\""]
["07:43,180","07:44,340","\"I really like Larkstein.\""]
["07:44,340","07:45,260","\"I think she's fun.\""]
["07:45,260","07:46,700","\"I think she's my favorite.\""]
["07:46,700","07:49,660","\"I think she's the only one I don't get upset with like in any way.\""]
["07:49,660","07:50,660","\"I think she's fun.\""]
["07:50,660","07:54,060","\"Axel is like, I like Axel.\""]
["07:54,060","07:59,900","\"Um, I don't think he ever made a single good decision in his entire life, but goddamn fool\""]
["07:59,900","08:08,700","\"But I think like I said, I guess that's what's endearing about him. You think so? I guess he's a he's got this like\""]
["08:08,700","08:12,000","\"I don't get mad at him. I mean I try to have a cool attitude\""]
["08:12,000","08:15,700","\"Yeah, like he's just a dope. That's what he feels like to be is that he's just kind of a dope. Oh\""]
["08:15,700","08:22,760","\"There's something fun about it. I'm sure nobody would agree. No in the in the fan. No, but hey, I like him. So okay\""]
["08:22,760","08:24,760","\"Oh my god.\""]
["08:24,760","08:26,760","\"You kill. You kill.\""]
["08:26,760","08:30,760","\"That should be Donald's new voice.\""]
["08:30,760","08:32,760","\"I wonder what all these things make.\""]
["08:32,760","08:38,760","\"Since I didn't have this game, I have no idea what synthesis stuff that's for.\""]
["08:38,760","08:40,760","\"He makes photosynthesis.\""]
["08:40,760","08:42,760","\"Then he says I'm not a lipid.\""]
["08:42,760","08:44,760","\"That was an educational film.\""]
["08:44,760","08:48,760","\"That was an educational film that both of me and Dingo apparently got to see in\""]
["08:48,760","08:50,760","\"high school.\""]
["08:50,760","08:54,920","\"- You referenced it to somebody, and my mind was blown,\""]
["08:54,920","08:57,160","\"and nobody else knew what you were talking about,\""]
["08:57,160","09:00,500","\"but we both somehow saw the same educational film, I guess.\""]
["09:00,500","09:04,480","\"- Chris, tell us about your high school experience, Chris.\""]
["09:04,480","09:05,320","\"What did you learn?\""]
["09:05,320","09:06,320","\"- What was your favorite educational film they had to watch?\""]
["09:06,320","09:09,640","\"- I watched Biodome in biology class.\""]
["09:09,640","09:11,080","\"- He was telling me that earlier.\""]
["09:11,080","09:11,920","\"- They showed us Biodome.\""]
["09:11,920","09:13,240","\"- That is the meanest thing they could've done.\""]
["09:13,240","09:14,920","\"- That's not even made you stupid or--\""]
["09:14,920","09:16,760","\"- Yeah, that's not gonna teach you anything.\""]
["09:16,760","09:17,600","\"I don't mind saying--\""]
["09:17,600","09:18,640","\"- It was not to teach.\""]
["09:18,640","09:20,120","\"They were like, oh, it's an off day,\""]
["09:20,120","09:20,960","\"- So we're putting it out though.\""]
["09:20,960","09:22,520","\"- Oh come on, bio done, why?\""]
["09:22,520","09:23,600","\"- Believe it, even then.\""]
["09:23,600","09:26,560","\"- That's not a fun movie for an off day.\""]
["09:26,560","09:28,160","\"It makes you wish the class would just end.\""]
["09:28,160","09:29,000","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:29,000","09:30,680","\"- You're gonna be looking at the clock even more.\""]
["09:30,680","09:32,440","\"- That literally just made you dumber.\""]
["09:32,440","09:34,800","\"Like there's nothing that movie offers.\""]
["09:34,800","09:35,640","\"- Where else?\""]
["09:35,640","09:36,720","\"- Maybe that was the plan.\""]
["09:36,720","09:39,240","\"They suck your brain out so that they put it back in.\""]
["09:39,240","09:40,640","\"- One of the guys that was in that movie,\""]
["09:40,640","09:41,920","\"I think it was Paulie Shore.\""]
["09:41,920","09:43,760","\"He did an interview lately and they're like,\""]
["09:43,760","09:44,580","\"\"\"So how are you doing?\"\"\""]
["09:44,580","09:46,160","\"He's like, \"\"Not good.\"\"\""]
["09:46,160","09:48,800","\"- They trapped me in the bio dome.\""]
["09:48,800","09:53,800","\"You know he pretty much said like, like after that movie Hollywood like chewed me up and spat me out.\""]
["09:53,800","09:55,400","\"No one talked to me anymore.\""]
["09:55,400","09:58,400","\"Radiant Garden.\""]
["09:58,400","10:00,800","\"Do they ask him if he still lived in a bio dome?\""]
["10:00,800","10:02,800","\"There would have to be.\""]
["10:02,800","10:04,800","\"Flip the table over and jump that the guy's in that.\""]
["10:04,800","10:06,200","\"He just leaves.\""]
