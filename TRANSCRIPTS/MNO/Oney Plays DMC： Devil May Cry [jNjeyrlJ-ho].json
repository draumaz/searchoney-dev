["05:06,200","05:11,040","\"I think it gets a little too much shit, but it also has some really dumb shit that happens in it\""]
["05:11,040","05:17,140","\"And yeah Dante's design is I don't like it at all and his personality and his humor\""]
["05:17,140","05:20,700","\"Yeah, yeah, I mean\""]

["06:01,880","06:03,880","\"Dude, you know it's gonna happen\""]
["06:03,880","06:09,120","\"So yeah, it plays pretty identical to the other ones honestly\""]
["06:09,120","06:16,200","\"Hold me the launch you get your launchers. Yeah, okay. I kind of remember this now\""]
["06:16,200","06:22,480","\"I think I played one devil may cry and I think it was two or three three is like the good one\""]
["06:22,480","06:24,680","\"Yeah, three is easily the best\""]
["06:24,680","06:30,580","\"Fine is actually pretty cool, but I couldn't tell you like what happened in one single level of five\""]
["06:30,580","06:34,980","\"I think people take a three story like too seriously\""]
["06:34,980","06:38,080","\"Three is a lot of fun. Well like the okay\""]
["06:38,080","06:41,640","\"So the big thing that separates this devil may cry from the other devil may cries\""]
["06:41,640","06:48,020","\"The other devil may cries are super like tongue-in-cheek like goofy. No, no three is like pure cheese\""]
["06:48,020","06:55,100","\"But I know people who are like I always cry at this part. It's like is really it's fucking stupid. Yeah, people cry at three\""]
["06:55,100","06:59,900","\"Yeah, what part of three do they cry at like Dante and Virgil running each other at the end\""]
["07:00,060","07:03,620","\"When they're like you're my brother, but I gotta fight you\""]
["07:03,620","07:06,020","\"Why would that make you cry?\""]
["07:06,020","07:11,000","\"It's the part where they decide for the last time you know what I don't really like you that much\""]
["07:11,000","07:14,860","\"I don't know I have no idea. I'm sorry like it's just weird\""]
["07:14,860","07:19,220","\"Do you see that the the brawl was holding his guns up? I did\""]
["07:19,220","07:23,540","\"Know escape. What's with this floor shit the text? Yeah?\""]
["07:23,540","07:26,540","\"Excuse me\""]
["07:26,780","07:33,200","\"Do you live on the Santa Monica Pier something like that? Yeah in a trailer well no the trailer is gone now\""]
["07:33,200","07:37,460","\"Getting a trailer rent space for that pier must be a lot probably\""]
["07:37,460","07:41,900","\"I don't know if it got thrown onto the pier or what happens\""]
["07:41,900","07:48,720","\"Doesn't fucking matter this guy always called Evan\""]
["07:52,540","07:58,820","\"That's so lame you have to say it out loud. Oh, yeah, cuz you got to know right this this is what you remember\""]
["07:58,820","08:03,900","\"But it's a little different take a bath those crits or bath looks in the camera\""]
["08:03,900","08:07,380","\"I guess everyone wants a part of Dante son of Sparta\""]
["08:07,380","08:14,380","\"And\""]
["08:14,380","08:17,420","\"Fuck you spiders, dude, I'm tired of them\""]
["08:20,540","08:24,900","\"No, you're a demon you can tell by my perfect chest\""]
["08:24,900","08:30,460","\"It sounds pretty demony yeah, so in this game\""]
["08:30,460","08:34,840","\"The demons and stuff are all in like a like an alternate reality\""]
["08:34,840","08:42,260","\"That you kind of ghost between I see this game actually one thing I will give it is the levels in this game\""]
["08:42,260","08:44,260","\"Are super fun like the level designs?\""]
["08:44,260","08:46,900","\"Are pretty cool?\""]
["08:46,900","08:50,920","\"And then Dante just comes in through him and he's like I'm so epic and me\""]
["08:50,920","08:58,220","\"Not limbo I know how to get out. I just go as low as I can go\""]
["08:58,220","09:06,180","\"So it's not really his origin story like he's already been a demon hunter I guess\""]
["09:06,180","09:09,380","\"That's what every game is like though\""]
["09:09,380","09:13,120","\"Well, I mean that I'm just saying that's the impression\""]
["09:13,120","09:19,680","\"It's his job in the other ones. I think in this one is just like he goes here sometimes by accident\""]
["09:19,680","09:27,360","\"Sometimes I just want to kill some demons sometimes. I just want to collect a little homunculus from the wall\""]
["09:27,360","09:30,640","\"I like the the enemy designs some of them are pretty cool\""]
["09:30,640","09:37,520","\"Yeah, there's things to like in this game and there's also just as much to not like which I think it's pretty cool\""]
["09:37,520","09:41,680","\"But come on get get on it. I like the role-body demons\""]
["09:42,400","09:45,360","\"I'm pretty sure I can smack them up into this. There we go. Yeah\""]
["09:45,360","09:50,940","\"Get in there that's a cool backdrop\""]
["09:50,940","09:57,000","\"Tomar yes\""]
["09:57,000","10:02,900","\"Have you ever been on that ride before oh one of those things yeah, I have I like those\""]
["10:02,900","10:08,760","\"Those are really fun. I like the ones that are enclosed where you get thrown up against the wall. Oh, yeah\""]
["10:08,760","10:14,560","\"Like the centrifugal force push you against it and you can get your pants will flow up your back\""]
["10:14,560","10:20,840","\"But I have I have stood up on the wall like sideways\""]
["10:20,840","10:27,140","\"You faced inward yeah like with my head going through the middle\""]
["10:27,140","10:36,160","\"So stupid you're not supposed to do that yeah, but I really wanted to because what other opportunity would I get a free break your head off\""]
["10:36,160","10:38,160","\"someone else's head I\""]
