["00:29,900","00:33,220","\"Also this game came out in 2004, can you believe that?\""]
["00:33,220","00:36,500","\"Wow, yeah, that was the year I graduated high school.\""]

["00:44,820","00:46,020","\"Which one do I pick?\""]
["00:46,020","00:50,300","\"I don't know, this is gonna stick with you for the rest of your days though, so don't\""]
["00:50,300","00:52,780","\"take this choice lightly.\""]
["00:52,780","00:57,340","\"You're on your deathbed as your life is flashing before your eyes, these choices are going to\""]

["01:04,220","01:08,420","\"looks like my face? Because it had to look really distinct on a tiny screen.\""]
["01:08,420","01:13,860","\"Here editor put a girl filter on this. Planet's a base. I call this place home\""]
["01:13,860","01:19,140","\"once. Okay, doesn't sound good. Never mind. Uh, in peaceful times long before\""]

["01:36,180","01:41,720","\"Wow wait a room the ending to the game within the first second you shitty game developers\""]
["01:41,720","01:48,460","\"The game by saying the time is her being a woman was a big surprise for all the children back in the day\""]
["01:48,460","01:51,700","\"And now they just ruin it from the get-go. I don't think they were gonna ever support\""]
["01:52,340","01:55,460","\"You know ever say that Samus was a lady\""]
["01:55,460","02:03,000","\"Ultimate zero mission which was the first game. Yeah, it's definitely not called\""]
["02:03,000","02:11,380","\"And halfway through the game there's that clever mr. Act scene where her suit extends like a little thing so that she takes a shit\""]
["02:11,380","02:15,380","\"Yeah\""]
["02:15,380","02:19,140","\"Pitched off now that I've seen that the game's rune. Let's go in here\""]
["02:20,940","02:26,780","\"But yeah, Lolly you thought that was a big important moment to right like when you first played the original Metroid back in 1970\""]
["02:26,780","02:33,920","\"You saw that it was a pixelated woman what went through your brain my my brain said horny horny me\""]
["02:33,920","02:40,400","\"horny me do and then I immediately I went and I said naked Samus on\""]
["02:40,400","02:43,100","\"On the fun the young\""]
["02:44,060","02:48,420","\"- Yeah, on the dogpile.com or Ask Jeeves\""]
["02:48,420","02:49,820","\"or whatever the hell they had back then.\""]
["02:49,820","02:52,140","\"- The dogpile I think was one of the first\""]
["02:52,140","02:54,220","\"search engine aggregators.\""]
["02:54,220","02:57,340","\"- And it took 43 minutes and it pulled up a picture\""]
["02:57,340","03:00,900","\"of a whole nipple and I said, this is the future.\""]
["03:00,900","03:02,340","\"My wank tank is complete.\""]
["03:02,340","03:06,380","\"Also, that does look like the fraps frames.\""]
["03:06,380","03:07,300","\"- It really does.\""]
["03:07,300","03:08,140","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:08,140","03:08,980","\"- Oh.\""]
["03:08,980","03:11,660","\"- And it maybe fraps, stolen from Metroid Fusion.\""]
["03:11,660","03:14,860","\"- Yeah, we're making ourselves seem so old\""]
["03:14,860","03:16,220","\"with all of this, honestly.\""]
["03:16,220","03:17,540","\"- We're just mentioning fraps.\""]
["03:17,540","03:19,540","\"- Mentioning fraps, mentioning being shocked.\""]
["03:19,540","03:21,460","\"- No one uses anything other than OBS now.\""]
["03:21,460","03:23,220","\"- Samus is a woman.\""]
["03:23,220","03:26,220","\"I legitimately thought it was Samus too,\""]
["03:26,220","03:27,500","\"for the longest time.\""]
["03:27,500","03:28,340","\"- Samus.\""]
["03:28,340","03:30,540","\"- Ah, the great Samus has visited us.\""]
["03:30,540","03:33,020","\"- I just never, you know, it's one of those things\""]
["03:33,020","03:35,260","\"that you read and you never hear set out loud,\""]
["03:35,260","03:37,460","\"so I just assumed it was Samus.\""]
["03:37,460","03:39,340","\"- I'm sure I had some words like that.\""]
["03:39,340","03:41,820","\"Same way I thought I'd conveniently forgotten.\""]
["03:41,820","03:44,660","\"Same way I thought it was Hermione.\""]
["03:44,660","03:46,660","\"- Hermione, yeah.\""]
["03:46,660","03:49,460","\"No, I think I would have read that as Hermione too.\""]
["03:49,460","03:52,380","\"If I had actually bothered reading the book\""]
["03:52,380","03:53,460","\"before seeing the movie.\""]
["03:53,460","03:54,740","\"- I don't think that's any kid's fault.\""]
["03:54,740","03:56,740","\"That's stupid British people making up silly words.\""]
["03:56,740","03:59,340","\"- Yeah, their names really are just made up.\""]
["03:59,340","04:03,220","\"Just them and them alone.\""]
["04:03,220","04:06,980","\"- They have names like Rutger, Rutger.\""]
["04:06,980","04:08,020","\"- Billington.\""]
["04:08,020","04:10,260","\"Yeah, Churchill idiots.\""]
["04:10,260","04:11,380","\"A lot of them.\""]
["04:11,380","04:12,740","\"Flambastrio.\""]
["04:12,740","04:13,540","\"Flanders.\""]
["04:13,540","04:15,620","\"Cobble snatch.\""]
["04:15,620","04:16,980","\"Cobble pot.\""]
["04:16,980","04:20,420","\"You cobble pot's a real one, isn't it?\""]
["04:20,420","04:21,140","\"It seems real.\""]
["04:21,140","04:24,500","\"Cobble pot.\""]
["04:24,500","04:26,420","\"Look what I found, a big testicle.\""]
["04:26,420","04:28,260","\"It just makes me think of Batman.\""]
["04:28,260","04:28,900","\"Long beam.\""]
["04:28,900","04:31,780","\"You shined it on your testicle to kill the sperm.\""]
["04:31,780","04:35,060","\"Makes all your sperm longer.\""]
["04:35,060","04:35,540","\"Check this out.\""]
["04:35,540","04:37,380","\"I don't know what you think the long beam does,\""]
["04:37,380","04:39,380","\"But it does that oh\""]
["04:39,380","04:44,380","\"That's different from your other beam well you should just kind of just fizzle out halfway through at the screen\""]
["04:44,380","04:46,540","\"Oh, I see oh so this one now\""]
["04:46,540","04:51,640","\"It's considered long because it makes it all the way across your your hundred pixel wide screen\""]
["04:51,640","04:56,380","\"Yeah, you can do that see it's weird that that's an upgrade they give it to you so early to that it might as well\""]
["04:56,380","05:04,140","\"Not have been that's not very nice. It's just you where to go and you just want to do the idea of upgrades at this point\""]
["05:04,140","05:07,280","\"Okay, that's fair. You don't have to put me on blast like that dude\""]
["05:07,280","05:15,600","\"Basic game design lot um kind of learn some game design mechanics perhaps maybe when you're gonna make the sanity not included video game\""]
["05:15,600","05:20,140","\"Then you'll know what the fuck you're talking about that was a thing at one point. Yeah, no\""]
["05:20,140","05:25,660","\"It was we were we were trying to make something that was kind of similar to punch out or something scrunch it\""]
["05:25,660","05:31,820","\"But I don't think anybody involved in actually putting it together knew what they were doing\""]
["05:31,820","05:37,380","\"I've always wondered about making a punch out game. It really does feel like it would have like no a\""]
["05:37,380","05:42,140","\"Lot less complicated programming, but a lot of pressure would be on that\""]
["05:42,140","05:46,820","\"Sort of on the animators and just the fine tuning of like making it feel good\""]
["05:46,820","05:51,100","\"Yeah, we had kind of like a punch it was like\""]
["05:51,100","05:54,460","\"kind of\""]
["05:54,460","06:00,980","\"Horizontal instead of like dead on the idea was you would like crouch and jump instead of like we've left and right\""]
["06:00,980","06:08,380","\"A sort of still more of like a side side kind of but it was built around like your character doesn't really move\""]
["06:08,380","06:13,220","\"You just kind of like dodge in various ways, but it was it was so like mismanaged\""]
["06:13,220","06:20,020","\"I don't think there was ever really a developer involved. It was it was just machinima kind of blindly\""]
["06:20,020","06:24,320","\"Saying like we're gonna do this. That's what every YouTube network was\""]
["06:24,320","06:29,300","\"It was just a bunch of people who didn't know anything and who made a bunch of promises that they knew they could never keep\""]
["06:29,940","06:37,700","\"Rock honestly, yeah, I miss that I miss being promised things that I never get me to at least I had the promises\""]
["06:37,700","06:41,340","\"That's something right. Oh this room runs like shit\""]
["06:41,340","06:45,180","\"That's the the challenge setting in\""]
["06:45,180","06:51,940","\"Hey, uh, emulator coders get your shit together because how else am I supposed to steal games? I mean\""]
["06:51,940","06:58,080","\"Emulator coders maybe call my dad on the phone and tell him that he was wrong about me\""]
["06:59,060","07:03,760","\"Just so you know, I bought this fucking game when I was like 12 so each shit. I own it\""]
["07:03,760","07:11,440","\"Yeah, the digital Millennium copyright act here protects Chris and his right to own a legal backup copy and a firearm\""]
["07:11,440","07:13,440","\"To shoot people who try to steal me to jail\""]
["07:13,440","07:19,920","\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's one of your nail-able rights. I know that those words came out in the wrong order, but\""]
["07:19,920","07:23,320","\"It's like I like the way it sounded\""]
["07:24,080","07:30,520","\"That's like a kids book. That's how you uh, description in the kids book and it makes the kids go\""]
["07:30,520","07:31,480","\"That's the swing\""]
["07:31,480","07:36,220","\"Does the missile take action give you missiles? Oh, okay, you can fire missiles. What do you think?\""]
["07:36,220","07:40,340","\"Dunkey, that's my favorite children's book. Does the missile tank actually?\""]
["07:40,340","07:45,020","\"I'm just saying in a lot of games you actually have to collect a missile launcher to get missiles\""]
["07:45,020","07:50,620","\"Your mom's gonna have to just have them. Check this out. Check this out. Check this out. Check this out. Check this out\""]
["07:50,620","07:53,320","\"Your mom's\""]
["07:53,440","07:55,240","\"nipple flaunter\""]
["07:55,240","08:01,520","\"Kill that thing. Yeah. Oh my god. It's running so badly shoot missiles in its eye for looking at you\""]
["08:01,520","08:05,720","\"I am Samus. Oh\""]
["08:05,720","08:10,000","\"No, I do like that effect where the missiles just go\""]
["08:10,000","08:13,400","\"Deflates yeah, I\""]
["08:13,400","08:18,160","\"Mean it's pretty impressive the music's keeping up while the game's not\""]
["08:18,160","08:22,200","\"You son of a fucking bitch now I'm screwed\""]
["08:22,960","08:29,000","\"Do you have no missiles? I don't think you need missiles to defeat him. I can beat him later. Oh, it's just a loan\""]
["08:29,000","08:33,860","\"Oh, it just detects that you it's unwinnable for you and just leaves. Yeah, I should have beat him there\""]
["08:33,860","08:40,500","\"That's easy. I think does it have guilt is that why it left you on your lonesome? Well, I shot it twice\""]
["08:40,500","08:49,440","\"It actually has it can feel like about four times more emotions than Samus Aaron can sorry Samus\""]
["08:49,440","08:52,620","\"There's crazy shit like that like whales where they're like they are\""]
["08:52,620","09:00,780","\"Scared I remember you don't don't like doesn't like the part of the part of their brain that feels emotions on like elephants and whales\""]
["09:00,780","09:06,080","\"Like way bigger than ours. Yeah, there's scream a gala. There's scream a gala\""]
["09:06,080","09:08,960","\"We used to scream, but they use for so much more\""]
["09:08,960","09:12,500","\"This room's purple and junk\""]
["09:12,500","09:14,300","\"Yeah\""]
["09:14,300","09:16,980","\"That does tend to happen in places like this\""]
["09:17,340","09:22,240","\"Doesn't that make it more immersive of like an alien planet than the purple yeah\""]
["09:22,240","09:27,320","\"I think the idea was to just pick a cuss color that contrasted really hard with Samus's armor\""]
["09:27,320","09:31,680","\"No, it's cause on alien planets everything's purple. Oh, okay\""]
["09:31,680","09:34,100","\"Think about it earth green-blue\""]
["09:34,100","09:36,980","\"Aliens purple\""]
["09:36,980","09:37,880","\"Get it\""]
["09:37,880","09:42,020","\"That is color you don't see a lot of nature except in this example and in this one\""]

["09:58,940","10:01,100","\"Come on. I'll make you joke\""]
["10:01,100","10:04,540","\"Fine it's almost like Christopher Nolan's directing\""]
["10:04,540","10:13,980","\"You said the camera's not helping. I was talking about the nuts. Okay. Oh that joke. Yeah, that looks like my scrot. Okay. Thank you\""]

["10:57,660","11:00,380","\"streaming service there's such a such a\""]
["11:00,380","11:03,420","\"he had a fucking world he has a problem\""]
["11:03,420","11:05,860","\"that just anybody can relate to he added\""]
["11:05,860","11:07,580","\"some fucking colorful language in there\""]
["11:07,580","11:10,100","\"too but I I forget what he fucking said\""]
["11:10,100","11:14,020","\"But yeah, it was like I don't know Christopher Nolan's movies\""]
["11:14,020","11:18,660","\"I specifically fucking avoid in the theater because he's like how about I rip your goddamn ears off\""]
["11:18,660","11:26,260","\"Oopsie Christopher Nolan said that yeah Christopher Nolan said you Chris are a prick. I'd say the memento sucks in\""]

["11:47,180","11:52,180","\"I feel like he'd be like what the fuck why did he say that? Why it put me on the map?\""]

["12:27,260","12:33,740","\"To be fair to them. I never even knew about that should be fair though. Ocarina of time was a masterpiece\""]
["12:34,020","12:40,260","\"So that no one can deny yeah, but not even a fucking idiot, but it's not 1998 anymore\""]
["12:40,260","12:44,080","\"So maybe they should try something new. Well, maybe it should be 1998 again\""]
["12:44,080","12:51,080","\"Did that come out in 98? I think you you either nailed it or you got it completely wrong. You know what is 1998?\""]
["12:51,080","12:56,100","\"1998 yeah, there's only one baby. You can't emulate that\""]

["13:49,900","13:57,380","\"Yeah, no, you sometimes you get some random person save data either at blockbuster or just like yeah getting getting used stuff\""]
["13:57,380","14:03,300","\"I remember when I played ocarina of time I had this crazy like the guy did everything\""]
["14:03,300","14:09,780","\"So I got this weird crazy preview of what the end of the game was gonna be like so I saw like Link was an adult\""]
["14:09,780","14:13,940","\"He was wearing a red tunic and he had a big sword and I was like he ruined the whole game for you\""]
["14:13,940","14:19,700","\"I it in a way it made it cool though because I was like this little bitch with a knife and I was like\""]
["14:19,700","14:22,540","\"When do I become the cool guy with the big sword?\""]
["14:22,540","14:25,820","\"Did I ever tell you this story about when I first saw a link to the past?\""]
["14:25,820","14:33,700","\"No, it was like the first house we ever got in Atlanta and it belonged to the Japanese family\""]
["14:33,700","14:40,300","\"And their son I just remember like my parents were looking around and like\""]
["14:40,300","14:42,900","\"They were like this would be your room\""]
["14:42,900","14:49,900","\"And I like walked inside and like their son was just sitting there and he was playing like he had like a like the Japanese\""]
["14:49,900","14:55,260","\"Super Famicom which I looked at and instantly was like why does that look so much cooler than the American one?\""]
["14:55,260","15:02,380","\"But then also like he was playing that game and it was still like a year from release in the US and\""]
["15:02,380","15:07,220","\"I was just like this is what Zelda looks like in Japan and like\""]
["15:07,220","15:11,340","\"Like when I played the game like years later, I'm like this is the same fucking game\""]
["15:11,340","15:13,940","\"I don't know that so you were like\""]
["15:13,940","15:20,960","\"Interesting a story, but but it was it was an exciting moment for me to just like happen to get this glimpse into\""]
["15:21,780","15:26,860","\"into like a pre-release title entirely by accident because of a house I moved into\""]
["15:26,860","15:32,020","\"Yeah, Japanese to US releases used to be way way off\""]
["15:32,020","15:36,260","\"Like it used to be came out in Japan and then came out in the US like two years later\""]
["15:36,260","15:41,540","\"Yep, when I was a teenager I played all the Zelda's\""]
["15:41,540","15:46,860","\"Like ocarina time and wing waker and then a link to the past came out on Game Boy Advance\""]
["15:46,860","15:49,980","\"I was like, oh, this is cool. This is a new Zelda game\""]
["15:49,980","15:55,920","\"I thought it was brand new and when I played it I couldn't get over how much I hated the sound of the instruments and the music\""]
["15:55,920","15:58,840","\"It was like this sounds like fucking ass. What does it sound so gross?\""]
["15:58,840","16:05,920","\"Well for one the Game Boy Advance has a really bad sound chip so it wasn't helping but I remember the French horn sound effect pissed me off\""]
["16:05,920","16:10,580","\"Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about. It's so ugly the list that it's very\""]
["16:10,580","16:16,080","\"I don't know how to describe it other than it makes you feel like you have a fever or something\""]
["16:16,080","16:19,940","\"I just I really don't like it for some reason. It just sounds so ugly\""]
["16:19,940","16:23,140","\"You're talking about\""]
["16:23,140","16:34,720","\"Yeah, it's just something about it it is I kind of in agreement even though there are some good tracks in that game\""]
["16:34,720","16:41,520","\"Oh, no music is beautiful, but it's just that one sample is when I hear it's like why couldn't you be any other sample in the entire world?\""]
["16:41,520","16:44,400","\"Do you mind the SNES version of it the same one really?\""]
["16:44,400","16:49,300","\"That the Game Boy Advance one is more and what has more of that like hiss in it because it's a game\""]
["16:49,300","16:54,800","\"What goes to shitty tiny speaker well the Game Boy Advance just has just weird hiss over every sample\""]
["16:54,800","16:59,360","\"Even in the emulator do you sort of still can you not hear it listen? I guess you're right?\""]
["16:59,360","17:06,400","\"You can hear that buzz. There's definitely like a tooth on everything. Yeah toothy bright warm money\""]
["17:06,400","17:09,200","\"creamy stinky\""]
["17:09,200","17:12,600","\"Yes\""]

["17:29,360","17:36,920","\"Cheesy I know the least about sound in the entire room. I'll just shut up\""]
["17:36,920","17:41,540","\"I'm not it. You know what I use those words cuz I'm a bit. Oh\""]
["17:41,740","17:43,740","\"See this room\""]
["17:43,740","17:51,100","\"You knew I knew I knew you old Wow now how am I supposed to get in here?\""]
["17:51,100","17:55,820","\"It's like you'd need some kind of cool grappling beam shit\""]
["17:55,820","18:01,300","\"Is that what you know what game the Japanese version actually like is totally different of it kind of rocks?\""]
["18:01,300","18:05,860","\"What you've ever played Donkey Konga. I love that game. Yeah, I like Donkey Kong\""]
["18:07,540","18:11,140","\"Interesting concept for a rhythm game, but uh\""]
["18:11,140","18:16,680","\"The songs that they picked for it. I think that they literally just went what's the cheapest?\""]
["18:16,680","18:20,120","\"Thing that was on the radio that we could license\""]
["18:20,120","18:25,280","\"So you're playing like rock lobster and stuff like that. That's a great song\""]
["18:25,280","18:31,380","\"We talked I had a friend from Japan and the Japanese version of that game has like this crazy\""]
["18:31,380","18:33,720","\"soundtrack of these real sick like\""]
["18:34,200","18:37,020","\"Japanese like metal songs and shit like that and\""]
["18:37,020","18:42,080","\"Yeah, it's very different. I mean obviously something like that\""]
["18:42,080","18:46,800","\"You don't a rhythm game the soundtrack really does make or break the game usually\""]
["18:46,800","18:50,840","\"You know what? I feel like DDR has a lot of weird Japanese music on it\""]
["18:50,840","18:55,960","\"And they just were like screw it. I thought most of it was like European music. Oh, I mean I could be wrong\""]
["18:55,960","18:59,120","\"It's a lot of like euro beat shit like Captain Jack and\""]
["19:00,440","19:05,620","\"That's a good song like Stan Bush. Did I really don't know what's Stan Bush like\""]
["19:05,620","19:12,340","\"Was the guy that like I don't know if he made music for Japan because like all the initial D stuff\""]
["19:12,340","19:17,920","\"I think is by him unless I'm thinking of the wrong guy. He called me. It's what maybe that's not Stan Bush\""]
["19:17,920","19:26,960","\"Maybe Stan Bush is the guy who did the sent transformers 1989 soundtrack him. Oh, okay. I'm thinking of the wrong guy not Stan Bush\""]
["19:27,680","19:30,440","\"He did something Rogersers\""]
["19:30,440","19:38,320","\"Mr.. Mr.. Fred who did all the initial D songs that are super memorable stinky Rogers look at him. I have no idea\""]
["19:38,320","19:46,660","\"ugly Rogers you're talking about like you running in the 90s and shit right yeah stuff like that nasty rocker like space boy and like\""]
["19:46,660","19:50,060","\"Dave Rogers that's who I was trying to think of\""]
["19:50,060","19:56,160","\"Not Stan Bush you got the touch he was Italian he was Italian so that is like Euro beats\""]
["19:56,860","20:02,760","\"Save please. I really want to figure out why it's slowing down. It's pissing me off honestly\""]
["20:02,760","20:10,280","\"What if you loaded up your euro beat playlist and then a Spotify said euro beat more like euro\""]
["20:10,280","20:12,280","\"Beast Samus would say\""]
["20:12,280","20:17,280","\"She would jiggle her back leg and her back fat\""]
["20:17,280","20:22,540","\"Yeah, her leg goes back, but yeah, but her torso and front legs stay completely stationary\""]
["20:22,540","20:26,740","\"So like Miyamoto goes up to the guy doing the sprite so when she aims up\""]
["20:26,740","20:30,820","\"I want you to make her get into a cool pose and like look up and then be all dramatic\""]
["20:30,820","20:37,300","\"And then the guy just like selects her back leg and moves it back a pixel then he gets fired and he gets sent a fucking\""]
["20:37,300","20:40,460","\"Sort of to himself. It's sent to a work camp. Yeah\""]
["20:40,460","20:46,160","\"One of those famous Nintendo work camps. Why would they put purple bugs in space?\""]
["20:46,160","20:51,780","\"Maybe they didn't put them there. Maybe that's just where they were born. What happened to your whole purple thesis\""]
["20:51,780","20:57,820","\"Did that just go out the window? Yeah, yeah, I thought we had this discussion. I mean their bugs not alien stupid alien bugs\""]
["20:57,820","21:02,740","\"No, they're just simple regular Pokemon. No I\""]
["21:02,740","21:09,380","\"Got a missile tank ain't you proud? I sure am son tanks, Dad. Oh\""]
