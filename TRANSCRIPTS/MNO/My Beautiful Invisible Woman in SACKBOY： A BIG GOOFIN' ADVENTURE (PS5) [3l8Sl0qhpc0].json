["00:07,600","00:10,560","\"Let's read P and something soup.\""]
["00:10,560","00:13,440","\"Oh yeah, they're like tiny and shit.\""]
["00:13,440","00:15,440","\"In a real man's world.\""]
["00:15,440","00:17,600","\"It's not really a real world though, is it?\""]
["00:17,600","00:19,040","\"Yeah, I know. And that's not something-\""]
["00:19,040","00:20,960","\"Grab his tail, grab his tail, yank it back.\""]
["00:20,960","00:22,880","\"Sackboy never grapples with that.\""]
["00:22,880","00:26,080","\"That a child could tear his arms off if he wanted.\""]
["00:26,080","00:28,640","\"And I feel like he should.\""]
["00:28,640","00:29,840","\"Yeah, trip on me.\""]
["00:29,840","00:38,280","\"Sweetie. Yes. Wow, you got it. There should be a thing in Toy Story where all the toys crawl down Andy's throat and suffocate him and he dies.\""]
["00:38,280","00:42,560","\"I think Toy Story 4 should have focused more on that.\""]
["00:42,560","00:47,800","\"I think at least once the toy should have taken a human life into those movies.\""]
["00:47,800","00:50,520","\"Yeah. I want some else Toy Barn to come back.\""]
["00:50,520","00:53,640","\"I want there to be real life consequences in the Toy Story.\""]
["00:53,640","00:56,280","\"Oh, yeah, we made it.\""]
["00:56,720","00:59,980","\"Is this thing you son of a bitch come out here coward?\""]
["00:59,980","01:03,360","\"You visible bitch\""]
["01:03,360","01:06,040","\"Hey, these guys kind of have like a little Yoshi fluid\""]
["01:06,040","01:11,160","\"Yeah, they do your love. Yeah, what's up if the invisible woman showed you were tits\""]
["01:11,160","01:15,120","\"Would you still get horny knowing that she did it even though you couldn't see it?\""]
["01:15,120","01:17,600","\"Were they so she's invisible at the time?\""]
["01:17,600","01:22,780","\"Yeah, that we're supposed to jump on these guys to get bounced up to the top maybe she's invisible at the time\""]
["01:22,780","01:28,920","\"So she's invisible and she goes hey, I was totally naked around you is that that kind of the premise\""]
["01:28,920","01:31,140","\"You're I'm showing you my tits right now. Oh, yeah\""]
["01:31,140","01:37,680","\"Yeah, if that alone would probably do it. Yeah, she's getting horny from it. Yeah, okay\""]
["01:37,680","01:41,880","\"Her invisibility powers go away and actually just like a fat version of you\""]
["01:41,880","01:44,460","\"Well, I got really horny\""]
["01:44,460","01:48,300","\"Not because I'd be attracted to a fat version of me\""]
["01:48,300","01:54,660","\"But because I know that I could be less attractive and and then that would make me grateful for not being yeah exactly\""]
["01:54,660","02:01,740","\"And your big turn on yeah, well then I could look at myself in the mirror and go that's hot by comparison to fat me\""]
["02:01,740","02:03,740","\"And then I get horny\""]
["02:03,740","02:07,260","\"And it still sounds like the invisible woman right?\""]
["02:07,260","02:12,820","\"The second she's like visible her voice goes 20 octave steepers\""]
["02:14,220","02:19,180","\"Well at this point I'm determined to get horny in this scenario, so I think I can make it work\""]
["02:19,180","02:23,660","\"Spotlight send me spotlight send me\""]
["02:23,660","02:27,180","\"Yeah, it's not fair I\""]
["02:27,180","02:34,240","\"Put in way more fucking effort than you bro. I put in the I was on the grind man the numbers don't lie breath\""]
["02:34,240","02:36,980","\"I'm on the grind. I put in the hours. Oh\""]
["02:36,980","02:44,060","\"That's the first level. We actually bothered collecting orbs. I guess. Oh, yeah, whatever those are for soaring\""]
["02:44,060","02:46,660","\"Were we not collecting them before?\""]
["02:46,660","02:50,460","\"Well, there's no- we don't have them on any of the levels we've done previously.\""]
["02:50,460","02:54,060","\"I've just been seeking shiny objects like a magpie.\""]
["02:54,060","02:58,060","\"So if we haven't been collecting them, that's not through any fault of our own.\""]
["02:58,060","02:59,660","\"Ooh, a fluffy lamp!\""]
["02:59,660","03:01,660","\"Oh god, we get a wish!\""]
["03:01,660","03:03,660","\"Give it a good rub!\""]
["03:03,660","03:05,660","\"Jeannie, come out and show us your fluffy.\""]
["03:05,660","03:07,660","\"Yeah, we did it!\""]
["03:07,660","03:08,660","\"Oh, you killed us.\""]
["03:08,660","03:10,660","\"Now we are in prison for all eternity.\""]

["03:11,660","03:12,660","\"Motherfucker!\""]
["03:12,660","03:13,660","\"That is the genius.\""]
["03:13,660","03:16,860","\"No, he's not. He's just a guy playing a prank.\""]
["03:16,860","03:18,660","\"Whoa, I think we're doing pretty good, honestly.\""]
["03:18,660","03:21,660","\"I think this is about as good as he can do, in fact.\""]
["03:21,660","03:23,960","\"Time.\""]
["03:23,960","03:26,660","\"You know what would make us even do better?\""]
["03:26,660","03:28,960","\"Is a fourth player like you, the viewer.\""]
["03:28,960","03:30,660","\"Edit a fourth player.\""]
["03:30,660","03:33,160","\"Put him in the bottom corner.\""]
["03:33,160","03:36,660","\"And make him have a lot of fun.\""]
["03:36,660","03:41,560","\"Now it's like he's really here.\""]
["03:41,560","03:42,360","\"Oh man.\""]
["03:42,360","03:43,960","\"He's coming right for us.\""]
["03:43,960","03:46,880","\"Uh, cut off his fucking ears.\""]
["03:46,880","03:50,160","\"And so we can't hear the things we say about him.\""]
["03:50,160","03:51,600","\"But what is this?\""]
["03:51,600","03:56,480","\"I think honestly the dynamic has slowed down considerably since that guy showed up.\""]
["03:56,480","03:57,960","\"You've ruined the channel.\""]
["03:57,960","03:59,760","\"Let's see.\""]

["04:06,760","04:08,160","\"Yeah, you're never fine.\""]
["04:08,160","04:09,960","\"What if they're slightly burnt?\""]
["04:09,960","04:11,160","\"Yeah, they're fine.\""]
["04:11,160","04:11,760","\"You're right.\""]
["04:11,880","04:16,260","\"I don't like them like crispy that they're weird when they're like boiled, but if you've ever had a bake\""]
["04:16,260","04:21,040","\"They're pretty good. Why are we talking about Brussels sprouts? Cuz there's Brussels sprouts. Oh, yeah\""]
["04:21,040","04:25,760","\"Oh these things I'm done with some roasted sprouts. Oh, that's what we're doing. That makes sense\""]
["04:25,760","04:33,680","\"Wait up. I wanted to cast those things to their graves and now I'm here. Tells right behind you. Okay. I'm in front\""]
["04:33,680","04:41,180","\"Whoa, that's evil. That's fucking scary disgusting. It's like I thought it was a pastry\""]
["04:41,180","04:46,380","\"You can't do that thought it was something you bounced on I thought I was gonna be fun man. I\""]
["04:46,380","04:55,040","\"Thought I was in for some whimsical joy and I became fucking prey to a to a horrible insectoid bouncing on cock. Yeah, nay\""]
["04:55,040","05:03,180","\"Uh if you think well, I think people should do it to me. I don't think that um, I don't think I should do it\""]
["05:03,180","05:04,900","\"It's just the frickin pussy\""]
["05:04,900","05:07,100","\"No, that's what should be bouncing on cock\""]
["05:07,740","05:11,660","\"Pussy here. Someone try to jump on my head to trigger this guy\""]
["05:11,660","05:19,820","\"Okay, oh you got it. Okay. I think now we just have to throw one of those dudes into that is that a button?\""]
["05:19,820","05:22,260","\"Yeah, I think that's a button. Yeah, I got it\""]
["05:22,260","05:27,560","\"Despite your best efforts you fucking apex predator fucking bitch\""]
["05:27,560","05:30,600","\"Can't believe they start off as those fucking\""]

["05:35,940","05:38,180","\"And the end of the life cycle is me\""]
["05:38,180","05:44,500","\"The tone of this game is making me sleepy really yeah everything's too comfy looking well\""]
["05:44,500","05:48,900","\"I mean it's not a bad thing it just makes you feel warm and soft yeah, I want to lie down in this world\""]

["11:57,860","11:59,820","\"We got over it eventually.\""]
