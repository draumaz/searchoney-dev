["00:28,880","00:30,880","\"This is not the Harry Potter I remember.\""]

["00:51,080","00:53,600","\"Gone, the cameras just fighting me too.\""]
["00:53,600","00:55,680","\"It was my favorite scene in the movie.\""]

["00:56,640","00:58,800","\"When he's in the attic and the floor collapses.\""]
["00:58,800","01:02,080","\"Look, if it wanted me to go this way, then why would it fight the camera against me like that?\""]
["01:02,080","01:06,720","\"When Harry gets stuck in between a box and a barrel and they can't walk for a minute.\""]
["01:06,720","01:09,080","\"It really immersed me in that part.\""]
["01:09,080","01:11,760","\"Why is he called Harry Potter if he isn't very Harry?\""]

["01:22,120","01:26,160","\"I think Tom fault made a game called Harry Potter back in the day.\""]
["01:26,160","01:26,920","\"Whoops.\""]
["01:26,920","01:27,760","\"It's very clever.\""]

["01:44,800","01:47,120","\"Weird owls best\""]
["01:47,120","01:50,240","\"The other reason I renamed it that was to get it more views\""]
["01:50,240","01:55,280","\"Weird owls best cuz I animated it\""]
["01:56,480","02:02,960","\"Listen you were the only one to punctuate it with that sound at the end what I mean you you did when\""]
["02:02,960","02:10,460","\"The shell falls on the character and I always thought to myself. That's how it should have ended\""]
["02:10,460","02:13,120","\"You improved thank you upon it\""]
["02:13,120","02:17,680","\"You kill you kill them. So lolly lulu lulu was the video originally called\""]

["02:20,280","02:25,240","\"Fucking God why did you retightel into that because nobody was watching it?\""]
["02:25,240","02:28,320","\"-I thought it would get more views.\""]
["02:28,320","02:29,000","\"-Did it?\""]
["02:29,000","02:29,600","\"-No.\""]
["02:29,600","02:30,320","\"-Oh.\""]
["02:30,320","02:31,440","\"-Julian saw it.\""]
["02:31,440","02:33,320","\"-I was like, \"\"What is wrong here?\""]
["02:33,320","02:34,800","\"Why is it my video getting more views?\"\"\""]
["02:34,800","02:38,000","\"-What if I say Weird Al and Oni's best?\""]
["02:38,000","02:41,480","\"-This was back before I had anything.\""]
["02:41,480","02:43,600","\"This is back before I did any of the cartoons that I had.\""]
["02:43,600","02:45,600","\"-I said it on the front page of Newgrounds.\""]
["02:45,600","02:47,880","\"-That was one of my first front pages though.\""]
["02:47,880","02:50,440","\"-Weird Al's best.\""]
["02:50,440","02:52,080","\"-I wonder how many views it has.\""]
["02:52,080","02:53,640","\"-I remember when I got posted.\""]
["02:53,640","02:55,280","\"People watched it when I got posted.\""]
["02:55,280","02:56,640","\"You notice that it's like one of the only\""]
["02:56,640","02:59,120","\"cartoons I didn't upload on my main page?\""]
["02:59,120","03:00,160","\"I wonder why that is.\""]
["03:00,160","03:03,040","\"It's probably because it's disgustingly shit.\""]
["03:03,040","03:06,480","\"Can you sing the part in the middle?\""]
["03:06,480","03:08,120","\"They got Alan Rancis, Jibble Feeders, Toilet,\""]

["03:22,320","03:24,520","\"Yeah, you animated the the gifteens shopping.\""]
["03:24,520","03:25,680","\"Yeah, it was clever, right?\""]
["03:25,680","03:29,680","\"It was the fat hen.\""]
["03:29,680","03:32,280","\"It's very rude.\""]
["03:32,280","03:33,680","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["03:33,680","03:34,680","\"You said the fat hen.\""]
["03:34,680","03:35,840","\"I said, \"\"hen.\"\"\""]
["03:35,840","03:37,920","\"The fat hen.\""]
["03:37,920","03:40,440","\"I think hen is nicer than hag.\""]
["03:40,440","03:42,080","\"You called her a hag.\""]
["03:42,080","03:43,640","\"I said fat hen.\""]
["03:43,640","03:45,560","\"Look at the size of the fucking coin he got.\""]
["03:45,560","03:47,240","\"Is that a coin?\""]
["03:47,240","03:47,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:47,600","03:48,600","\"I thought it was a shield.\""]
["03:50,160","03:52,560","\"Don't worry Harry, it'll last for generations.\""]
["03:52,560","03:54,880","\"That's how big a sickle is, how big is a galleon.\""]
["03:54,880","03:56,240","\"Holy shit.\""]
["03:56,240","03:59,000","\"I'm standing on a galleon, the planet is the galleon.\""]
["03:59,000","04:01,080","\"Look at this person.\""]
["04:01,080","04:02,160","\"It's a wizard.\""]
["04:02,160","04:03,080","\"Don't chase her.\""]
["04:03,080","04:04,080","\"I'm stalking her.\""]
["04:04,080","04:05,800","\"Oh my god, the fucking framerate.\""]
["04:05,800","04:07,920","\"What do you expect?\""]
["04:07,920","04:08,880","\"Look at how good it looks.\""]
["04:08,880","04:10,840","\"It's just like PS4.\""]
["04:10,840","04:14,120","\"It's not that standout for a PS2 game.\""]
["04:14,120","04:16,600","\"I know the classes looked really good.\""]
["04:17,120","04:21,120","\"I'm wondering just what they did to get it running this poorly.\""]
["04:21,120","04:26,120","\"I mean, the textures, you know, I think they might not be de-rendering things could be part of it.\""]
["04:26,120","04:28,280","\"I have to go find more sickles fucking real.\""]
["04:28,280","04:29,520","\"What's your favorite weird answer?\""]

["04:33,560","04:34,800","\"It will let me into the bank.\""]
["04:34,800","04:38,040","\"They conveniently closed it for just such an occasion.\""]
["04:38,040","04:40,680","\"Do you get a die-gone alley diagonally?\""]
["04:40,680","04:43,240","\"That's pretty clever.\""]
["04:43,240","04:44,520","\"I never thought of that.\""]
["04:44,520","04:45,600","\"That's pretty serious.\""]
["04:46,600","04:48,460","\"I started reading it when I was like five, dude.\""]
["04:48,460","04:49,760","\"Not five, I was like ten.\""]
["04:49,760","04:52,920","\"Remember Harry, make sure to say it perfectly crystal clear.\""]
["04:52,920","04:56,940","\"And then he's supposed to die again, Ali, but he says die again, Ali, and that's why he winds up in Nocturne.\""]
["04:56,940","04:58,360","\"Oh, you're right.\""]
["04:58,360","05:02,040","\"But why did he end up in Nocturne, Ali, over-die again, Ali, when all he said was die again, Ali?\""]
["05:02,040","05:03,480","\"It sounds nothing...\""]
["05:03,480","05:05,160","\"It sounds nothing like it.\""]
["05:05,160","05:05,800","\"I know.\""]
["05:05,800","05:07,960","\"Look, it's the Fat Ninja's elf.\""]
["05:07,960","05:09,260","\"Hello.\""]
["05:09,260","05:12,920","\"So wait, if he said the name of the other one incorrectly, would he have just ended up here?\""]
["05:12,920","05:16,440","\"And if that's the case, why doesn't everyone just tell him to say the wrong one?\""]
["05:16,440","05:24,120","\"I know. It's fucking bullshit. This world is dumb and their rules are stupid. Here's a sickle dipshit.\""]
["05:24,120","05:33,080","\"That's what it's like when you read a book as a kid.\""]

["05:39,480","05:43,160","\"You're gonna really see the frame right there.\""]

["05:50,320","05:53,720","\"- What was the most epicist rap music you remember as a child?\""]
["05:53,720","05:55,600","\"- I didn't, I chose not to listen to it\""]
["05:55,600","05:56,440","\"'cause I didn't like it.\""]
["05:56,440","05:57,280","\"- Link and park.\""]
["05:57,280","06:00,160","\"- Oh, so you liked everything but rap and country.\""]
["06:00,160","06:01,160","\"- Yes.\""]
["06:01,160","06:02,600","\"- I was one of those, I remember.\""]
["06:02,600","06:04,520","\"- I mean, it's why people say it.\""]
["06:04,520","06:06,440","\"It's what everybody said as a dumb old kid.\""]
["06:06,440","06:07,280","\"- Really?\""]
["06:07,280","06:08,120","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:08,120","06:09,680","\"- I don't like rap or country.\""]
["06:09,680","06:10,520","\"Is that a real thing?\""]
["06:10,520","06:12,320","\"- Yeah, that's a joke that people will make\""]
["06:12,320","06:15,100","\"because usually everybody when they're younger said that.\""]
["06:15,100","06:18,120","\"Oh well, I genuinely to this day have never liked rapper country.\""]
["06:18,120","06:19,120","\"How about rap?\""]
["06:19,120","06:20,480","\"I think it's cool, but I just don't like it.\""]
["06:20,480","06:21,480","\"More like crap.\""]
