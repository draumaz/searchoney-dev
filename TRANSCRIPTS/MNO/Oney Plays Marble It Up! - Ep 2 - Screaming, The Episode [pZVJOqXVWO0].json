["00:01,600","00:03,360","\"On a plane!\""]
["00:03,360","00:04,360","\"*sigh*\""]
["00:04,360","00:05,480","\"With friends...\""]
["00:05,480","00:07,440","\"It warns you with every sign.\""]
["00:07,440","00:08,680","\"I'm just not listening to them.\""]
["00:08,680","00:09,760","\"I don't know why.\""]
["00:09,760","00:11,120","\"It's because I'm thinking about having a reward.\""]
["00:11,120","00:13,200","\"Because having an urgent siren noise,\""]
["00:13,200","00:16,640","\"but I'm able to get a bunch of the exclamation points of puree.\""]
["00:16,640","00:21,640","\"When you're just rolling like as I can totally see that it's like...\""]
["00:21,640","00:25,920","\"You're gonna get sucked into it and just kind of want to casually like roll.\""]
["00:25,920","00:26,920","\"Yeah, exactly.\""]
["00:26,920","00:28,080","\"And not have to worry about it.\""]
["00:28,080","00:32,960","\"This level also tries to guide you off of it. You pick up too much speed. Okay, here we go. Jump here.\""]
["00:32,960","00:38,200","\"Yep, okay, and then this one here too. Yeah, I'd say stick around the middle around this portion. I have not\""]
["00:38,200","00:44,800","\"I have never driven on a road. I've practiced driving like this, but I was gonna say is that what it feels like?\""]
["00:44,800","00:49,960","\"Yes, they throw you off all the time. Then well, cars will go launching. Did I just do it again?\""]
["00:49,960","00:55,920","\"I did like when you're trying to drive like and you zone out and you're just enjoying the feeling of going fast\""]
["00:55,920","01:01,700","\"And then you go through the big loop you loop and you smile and you smile you get the super jump\""]
["01:01,700","01:07,980","\"Supa what is that from again? That's from this. Yeah, that's not from this game. That's from our blast the previous one\""]
["01:07,980","01:11,100","\"That's the same people is it the same people is the same people?\""]
["01:11,100","01:13,580","\"That's cool. Yeah, it is\""]
["01:13,580","01:19,460","\"You get used to you get used to creators not being attached to their projects anymore\""]
["01:19,460","01:22,220","\"But they came back and they made a really good follow-up\""]
["01:22,540","01:26,780","\"Was talking about this earlier where you know the way fall at 76 is a huge disaster\""]
["01:26,780","01:31,100","\"And people are like how the fuck does that even happen like how does such a big franchise?\""]
["01:31,100","01:35,720","\"How does that happen and I think the reason is because you know like Todd Howard and shit\""]
["01:35,720","01:39,780","\"He made like a Bolivian and he direct did he direct Skyrim? I don't know\""]
["01:39,780","01:41,980","\"I know he he was the main guy in a Bolivian, right?\""]
["01:41,980","01:45,060","\"these main guys work on the game and they become like\""]
["01:45,060","01:50,380","\"Like legends for working on these big popular games and then they become the head of the company\""]
["01:50,380","01:53,720","\"And then they just don't want to work anymore. They're literally just like I did my thing\""]
["01:53,720","01:57,120","\"I'm fucking done now. It seems like that's an issue with a lot of people\""]
["01:57,120","02:01,980","\"Yeah, that it's like once you've achieved what you think of as success. You're like okay. I'm done\""]
["02:01,980","02:05,820","\"I'm like you're working on more than like three games. I think part of it\""]
["02:05,820","02:09,100","\"Christ if we really I'm glad you didn't die\""]
["02:09,100","02:11,700","\"Oh, if we really want to get into this discussion\""]
["02:11,700","02:19,560","\"There's a lot of things that I could say but like I think part of it is that when you big budget games have like 300 people\""]
["02:19,560","02:27,320","\"Yeah, exactly. It's impossible to like maintain a sense of artistic vision when you're when any idea is being passed between\""]
["02:27,320","02:32,960","\"I mean, we're playing smash and there's like thousands of names in the credits. Yeah, but it really it does seem like\""]
["02:32,960","02:39,720","\"There's like there's there's always one good like really good guy who like does everything right and they direct the project\""]
["02:39,720","02:42,680","\"And everyone's like wow it's a fucking amazing, but then they become like\""]
["02:42,680","02:48,960","\"Shot and then they don't want to do it anymore a big mistake of people like that where it's like oh I achieved success\""]
["02:48,960","02:55,760","\"And now everybody knows me for a thing. Yeah, you got to make sure that you don't like you can't forget that you've still got\""]
["02:55,760","02:58,920","\"Stuff to learn even if you were considered really good at one point\""]
["02:58,920","02:59,280","\"Yeah\""]
["02:59,280","03:04,360","\"But it's not just that it's when they become the big guy and they're like I'm a millionaire now living in my mansion\""]
["03:04,360","03:08,160","\"You go do it then those people who come in are usually like not as experienced\""]
["03:08,160","03:08,960","\"Well, yeah, they're not either\""]
["03:08,960","03:14,440","\"Also, just not gonna know what to do and if the person the person who knows how to do it is not doing it in\""]
["03:14,680","03:17,720","\"in some capacity, like, whether it be direction or something.\""]
["03:17,720","03:18,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:18,040","03:21,000","\"Then yeah, it would make sense if you're just, okay,\""]
["03:21,000","03:22,680","\"executive producer Tim Burton.\""]
["03:22,680","03:23,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:23,080","03:26,360","\"I came to the set a couple days while they were doing a green screen thing.\""]
["03:26,360","03:30,280","\"I just wish that the directors on these games would have some kind of like\""]
["03:30,280","03:33,880","\"written guide where they're like, \"\"I did this. I remember doing this for a reason.\""]
["03:33,880","03:36,840","\"Can you please make sure this carries out in the future installments?\"\"\""]
["03:36,840","03:39,480","\"Or, you know, like the new Just Cause game has come out?\""]
["03:39,480","03:39,800","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:39,800","03:42,680","\"It's got like downgrades in certain aspects from the other game,\""]
["03:42,680","03:46,200","\"And it's like why like shouldn't the sequel be better in every way\""]
["03:46,200","03:52,380","\"But that idea where you're going also happens with the dead rising the dead rising for was a fucking disaster\""]
["03:52,380","03:56,240","\"That's because they rushed it. I know but I was because they didn't fucking take any\""]
["03:56,240","03:59,840","\"Why I was from the original I would say that was the biggest problem\""]
["03:59,840","04:02,180","\"I'm sure that was completely intentional though as well\""]
["04:02,180","04:06,920","\"I know but that's because everything everything right now is like geared towards getting a really wide audience\""]
["04:06,920","04:12,560","\"So if you know if something is too specific you have to move it towards like the original's take off for a reason\""]
["04:12,560","04:18,640","\"Yeah, yeah, it's true to be fair fall out one and two most people didn't seem that familiar with though\""]
["04:18,640","04:22,040","\"They only knew about it with fallout. Yeah, that's why it's a weird example\""]
["04:22,040","04:28,800","\"That's fair like what 76 is a disaster. There's no way and I would say it's mainly because they just also didn't really try\""]
["04:28,800","04:33,120","\"They looked around at everybody else and what they were doing and they kind of used it that fill in the void\""]
["04:33,120","04:35,960","\"Supposed to releasing like the thing they put time into\""]
["04:35,960","04:40,140","\"Juliet Bethesda's always been known though for having like really sloppy out\""]
["04:40,140","04:45,420","\"Oh man Christ I couldn't see shit but I also farted when I did that.\""]
["04:45,420","04:47,260","\"Did it startle you?\""]
["04:47,260","04:48,260","\"It did.\""]
["04:48,260","04:50,660","\"It was a little mouse fart.\""]
["04:50,660","04:52,660","\"Those are the fun to get out warnings.\""]
["04:52,660","04:56,260","\"Thank you for talking with us about game development.\""]
["04:56,260","04:57,420","\"Oh my god!\""]
["04:57,420","05:00,660","\"I'd say things are also just changing in general with the industry because there's\""]
["05:00,660","05:03,500","\"such a demand for more and more being put into games.\""]
["05:03,500","05:04,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:04,500","05:07,340","\"But then the budgets of these things and the involvement you have to get behind them.\""]
["05:07,340","05:08,340","\"It's not going to keep up.\""]
["05:08,340","05:13,160","\"I just get frustrated like that. I get frustrated when they take something good and they just like I\""]
["05:13,160","05:19,320","\"Told me I totally did rising is the best example of that where they just had no idea what the fuck they were doing\""]
["05:19,320","05:22,100","\"And I didn't care about the source well that that's the other problem\""]
["05:22,100","05:27,040","\"You would hope there's still some passion but when you also keep a franchise going for so long you can't keep passion\""]
["05:27,040","05:28,140","\"Yeah\""]
["05:28,140","05:30,720","\"There's a I don't know there's a lot of reasons the stuff can happen\""]
["05:30,720","05:35,000","\"All that just seemed like they flat out didn't care. Yeah, I wanted money and that was it yeah\""]
["05:36,480","05:43,280","\"Same with like red dead redemptions online and GTA 5's online that shit's just terrible the fact that fallout 76 has to run through\""]
["05:43,280","05:47,760","\"Its own client, which also doesn't work by the way and deleted everybody's files during the beta\""]
["05:47,760","05:54,760","\"It's clear. They just didn't want people to get refunds on it and they were hoping people would pay for the beta and at that point\""]
["05:54,760","05:57,280","\"It's like yeah, you're in you paid us the money. Oh, no\""]
["05:57,280","06:03,640","\"Oh, I have I did not play this far into the game. So this is new to me now. Oh, I like this level\""]
["06:04,280","06:08,440","\"Man every stage in this has shortcuts. I like it a lot. Oh you smelly little ball head\""]
["06:08,440","06:15,560","\"There you go, and some of them are actually really good like Chris you figured that out the second stage how they have the rocks to bounce off of\""]
["06:15,560","06:19,000","\"Mmm, that's intentional they have that on every level. They have little things like that\""]
["06:19,000","06:20,120","\"Yeah, I like that kind of stuff\""]
["06:20,120","06:22,660","\"I like extra shit that you can just mess with and figure out\""]
["06:22,660","06:28,040","\"Yeah, so the super jump has a quirk to it that if you use it as soon as you hit jump you get an even bigger jump\""]
["06:28,040","06:29,600","\"so\""]
["06:29,600","06:32,840","\"Like that you can do that to get up there really\""]
["06:32,840","06:36,100","\"So if you ramp off these little sloped walls\""]
["06:36,100","06:45,040","\"See you didn't even get going I didn't if you want diamond so I want you to do it\""]
["06:45,040","06:48,400","\"Yeah, you need to be really fast if you want diamond times. Oh my god\""]
["06:48,400","06:51,040","\"I see that wouldn't be it for a diamond time\""]
["06:51,040","06:54,440","\"You'd probably want to do something more like this and just swerve in\""]
["06:54,440","06:57,360","\"Get it\""]
["07:00,600","07:04,400","\"Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh\""]
["07:04,400","07:10,420","\"I was doing so good. I zoned out. I was doing good. It's okay Chris\""]
["07:10,420","07:14,880","\"I like it when you when you zone out playing a game and you're still doing good. That's pretty much all that playing guitar\""]
["07:14,880","07:19,820","\"Hero is I was just gonna say yeah, that makes me think of like rhythm games. That's why I like rhythm game so much\""]
["07:19,820","07:24,320","\"This is a very fun track. I like this track. It's feels like mini golf. No\""]
["07:24,320","07:26,920","\"You careful you don't want to\""]
["07:26,920","07:30,120","\"Damn it that actually scared me\""]
["07:30,120","07:33,500","\"I was just I was just able to channel the energy and to screaming\""]
["07:33,500","07:37,400","\"Almost in March, but it's a man\""]
["07:37,400","07:40,560","\"Good job\""]
["07:40,560","07:45,280","\"No one knew what you were gonna talk about family guy. We don't need to talk about it's true\""]
["07:45,280","07:49,940","\"Can't we talk about something we like let's talk about F is for family instead\""]
["07:49,940","07:55,900","\"Let's talk about Bob's burgers. No, I don't I haven't watched either. I'm sorry\""]
["07:57,600","08:01,780","\"That's for family looks like it could be alright. I watched the few of those they were fine. They were good\""]
["08:01,780","08:07,800","\"It looked like it'd be a fun show. I have not seen it. What is it? It's on net like so I have not it's like a\""]
["08:07,800","08:14,840","\"Comedy cartoon sitcom about the 70s average family the 70s. Yeah, Bill Burr\""]
["08:14,840","08:22,120","\"That's kind of fun. I've been wishing that people would like the 70s again. I think it was a fun. It's got a lot of fun\""]
["08:22,120","08:26,040","\"Visual it's fun. It's fun. It's fun, and it's also\""]
["08:26,040","08:28,040","\"That is what I sound like.\""]
["08:28,040","08:30,040","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["08:30,040","08:31,040","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["08:31,040","08:32,040","\"No, I'm sorry.\""]
["08:32,040","08:34,040","\"No, no positivity here.\""]
["08:34,040","08:35,040","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["08:35,040","08:36,040","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["08:36,040","08:37,040","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["08:37,040","08:38,040","\"No, I'm sorry.\""]
["08:38,040","08:39,040","\"No, I'm sorry.\""]
["08:39,040","08:40,040","\"Oh, man.\""]
["08:40,040","08:42,040","\"Can we talk about Harry Potter maybe?\""]
["08:42,040","08:43,040","\"If you like what?\""]
["08:43,040","08:46,040","\"Can we please talk about this issue already?\""]
["08:46,040","08:48,040","\"Do you guys like Harry Potter?\""]
["08:48,040","08:49,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:49,040","08:50,040","\"I read the books.\""]
["08:50,040","08:52,040","\"I only know a little bit about it.\""]
["08:52,040","08:53,040","\"I only read a couple.\""]
["08:53,040","08:55,040","\"I think it's a wonderful, magical plan.\""]
["08:55,040","09:00,640","\"You know it's about wizards so I heard there is magic involved at points.\""]
["09:00,640","09:05,040","\"Wait what? What? They don't do magic in that book.\""]
["09:05,040","09:07,040","\"I was just joking.\""]
["09:07,040","09:10,040","\"Oh, come on man.\""]
["09:10,040","09:13,040","\"I'm trying to think of good things to talk about with Harry Potter.\""]
["09:13,040","09:14,040","\"Taco Bell.\""]
["09:14,040","09:16,040","\"Yeah, remember the Taco Bell tie in?\""]
["09:16,040","09:17,040","\"Harry Potter and the Taco Bell.\""]
["09:17,040","09:21,040","\"And he brought your magic wand to Taco Bell to give you a big chalupa.\""]
["09:21,040","09:22,040","\"A chalupa.\""]
["09:22,040","09:27,560","\"Now Chris if you say diagonally wrong if you say Diagon Alley if you say that wrong\""]
["09:27,560","09:31,160","\"It sends you to hell it sends you it sends you to not turn alley\""]
["09:31,160","09:34,240","\"But if you say not turn alley wrong does that send you to Diagon Alley?\""]
["09:34,240","09:35,400","\"And if that's the case\""]
["09:35,400","09:42,380","\"Shouldn't you just say the one incorrectly because you have must like much less of a chance to fail it sends you to seers in downtown\""]
["09:42,380","09:44,380","\"Oh, that's even worse\""]
["09:44,380","09:51,960","\"Reflections are even real though. They're not I see the level on it\""]
["09:51,960","09:53,960","\"It's called a reflection map.\""]
["09:53,960","09:55,680","\"- It's called-- - Just kidding, that is--\""]
["09:55,680","09:58,040","\"- Magic. - I was just gonna say,\""]
["09:58,040","10:00,360","\"do you think wizards have any version of fast food?\""]
["10:00,360","10:01,320","\"- They have reflection maps.\""]
["10:01,320","10:02,840","\"- Yeah, do you think they have reflection maps\""]
["10:02,840","10:04,760","\"in the wizarding world?\""]
["10:04,760","10:06,480","\"- Yeah, I think they do.\""]
["10:06,480","10:08,680","\"That's how they make everything look so magical.\""]
["10:08,680","10:09,640","\"- That was in the second book,\""]
["10:09,640","10:11,040","\"Ron complains because the mirror\""]
["10:11,040","10:13,040","\"didn't have a reflection map tied to it.\""]
["10:13,040","10:13,880","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:13,880","10:15,480","\"He's very nitpicky about the world he exists in.\""]
["10:15,480","10:17,160","\"- Maybe that's what the mirror of Eris said was,\""]
["10:17,160","10:19,440","\"or it's just like a mirror with a broken reflection map.\""]
["10:19,440","10:21,440","\"And then they wrote it into the book as a cool story.\""]
["10:21,440","10:22,440","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["10:22,440","10:22,940","\"Oh.\""]
["10:22,940","10:25,200","\"They just used a random photo of Chicago on it.\""]
["10:25,200","10:27,440","\"Double doe, and I looked in and saw my parents.\""]
["10:27,440","10:28,440","\"Yes.\""]
["10:28,440","10:29,440","\"That's right.\""]
["10:29,440","10:30,440","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["10:30,440","10:33,440","\"That's your reflection, I guess.\""]
["10:33,440","10:36,440","\"The engine forgot to de-raz their models.\""]
["10:36,440","10:37,440","\"The models.\""]
["10:37,440","10:38,440","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["10:38,440","10:40,440","\"Wait, where am I going down here?\""]
["10:40,440","10:41,440","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:41,440","10:42,440","\"[SINGING]\""]
["10:42,440","10:44,440","\"I was worried that that wasn't going to count.\""]
["10:44,440","10:45,440","\"Yeah.\""]
