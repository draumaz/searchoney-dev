["02:53,940","02:55,340","\"in the Transformers movies.\""]
["02:55,340","02:57,680","\"And the reason this is fucking with me so hard\""]
["02:57,680","03:00,140","\"is because I was just buying in my own business,\""]
["03:00,140","03:02,740","\"walking around pretty close to where I live,\""]
["03:02,740","03:04,340","\"and I walk by this house,\""]
