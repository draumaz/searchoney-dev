["03:40,260","03:41,660","\"- 72% of it's true.\""]
["03:41,660","03:44,580","\"- There's weird shit goes on in Spider-Man.\""]
["03:44,580","03:48,220","\"He sold his marriage to the devil at one point\""]

["03:56,660","03:57,500","\"- Except for that may.\""]
["03:57,500","04:02,500","\"- There's some shit where some guy brought his parents\""]

["04:06,980","04:09,180","\"Yeah, and absorb their life energy.\""]
["04:09,180","04:12,860","\"I think there was a recent storyline from a couple of years ago where Spider-Man and\""]
["04:12,860","04:14,420","\"Doc-ox switch bodies.\""]
["04:14,420","04:17,580","\"Yeah, and Spider-Man was him for a while.\""]

["04:23,340","04:23,860","\"I don't like that.\""]
["04:23,860","04:28,140","\"Yeah, and then Doc-ox is Peter Parker for a little while, and then they just made it\""]
["04:28,140","04:31,140","\"so like Peter Parker's brain took back over.\""]
["04:31,140","04:31,780","\"What, you guys?\""]
["04:31,780","04:33,500","\"This is important stuff.\""]

["04:42,080","04:48,020","\"That looks like told me what these look pretty good actually for PS2 for when this made she doesn't look nearly\""]
["04:48,020","04:53,720","\"They should have made this surprise. It's kind of weird. Why would they go to their way to like recreate this scene 3d?\""]
["04:53,720","04:55,720","\"It's just a movie. Yeah, they could\""]
["04:55,720","04:59,600","\"I guess cuz it would have felt a little bit too. What is it Sega CD?\""]
