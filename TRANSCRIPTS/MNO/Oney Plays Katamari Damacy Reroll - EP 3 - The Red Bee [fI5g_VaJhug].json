["02:19,040","02:23,400","\"100% and here's and here's how I know\""]
["02:23,400","02:32,680","\"Has anyone ever been to space and look down at earth? Yeah, take that can any regular jack-off get a pilot's license?\""]
["02:32,680","02:39,680","\"I didn't think so. Okay. Well the easiest test you can do is hold a ruler up to the horizon in front of you\""]
["02:39,680","02:44,740","\"And if the horizon is curvy then the earth is round, but it won't be will it no\""]
["02:44,740","02:46,860","\"proof\""]
["02:46,860","02:48,860","\"evidence have you guys seen that a\""]

["03:00,880","03:05,620","\"I thought did did we I think so I don't think we did because I just saw it recently\""]
["03:05,620","03:08,620","\"- Oh, yeah, I think we talked about it where the guy was like,\""]
["03:08,620","03:10,420","\"yeah, this will prove if the Earth is flat,\""]
["03:10,420","03:12,500","\"and he's a flat Earth or, and he proves it to himself,\""]
["03:12,500","03:15,620","\"and he's like, wait a minute, this was interesting.\""]
["03:15,620","03:17,460","\"- Yeah, there's this like flat Earth,\""]
["03:17,460","03:19,100","\"like quote unquote scientist,\""]
["03:19,100","03:20,300","\"and everything that he does,\""]
["03:20,300","03:22,500","\"you could play the fucking curve to your enthusiasm,\""]
["03:22,500","03:24,260","\"theme after it, because he's like,\""]
["03:24,260","03:27,920","\"\"\"We got this $8,000 gyroscope, and we're gonna prove\""]
["03:27,920","03:30,560","\"\"\"if the Earth is really round, we can put it in this thing,\""]
["03:30,560","03:33,340","\"\"\"and after an hour, it'll move by 15 degrees.\"\"\""]
["03:33,340","03:34,780","\"And then they do it, and then it moves\""]
["03:34,780","03:39,280","\"by 15 degrees is like, well, that wasn't the result we were expecting, but maybe if we\""]
["03:39,280","03:44,640","\"put it in a steel tube, so it's isolated from everything, and then it does it again.\""]
["03:44,640","03:49,700","\"And he's like, well, I think we kind of need a barium tube here.\""]
["03:49,700","03:51,740","\"And that's going to take some time to obtain.\""]
["03:51,740","03:52,940","\"So we can't do that now.\""]
["03:52,940","03:56,480","\"And then it like cuts to him like later on at a flat earth party is like what we're\""]
["03:56,480","03:57,480","\"working with.\""]
["03:57,480","03:58,480","\"It's going to be mind blowing stuff.\""]

["04:00,180","04:03,420","\"It's like, what are you on, dude?\""]
["04:03,420","04:07,480","\"At the end of Men in Black 1, the camera pans out and you can clearly see the Earth is\""]
["04:07,480","04:08,480","\"round.\""]
["04:08,480","04:11,880","\"I thought it panned out and you could clearly see it was in a locker.\""]
["04:11,880","04:13,480","\"No, it's in a marble.\""]
["04:13,480","04:15,480","\"Oh yeah, yeah, it's in a marble.\""]
["04:15,480","04:19,640","\"If that Earth is also believed that every other celestial body is round, it's just not\""]
["04:19,640","04:24,000","\"the Earth because you can look at the moon and see that it's round and you can see different\""]
["04:24,000","04:25,000","\"sides of it.\""]
["04:25,000","04:31,840","\"I think that the moon and the sun are just big light bulbs that kind of oscillate over\""]
["04:31,840","04:32,840","\"the Earth.\""]
["04:32,840","04:33,840","\"I'm sure you're right.\""]

["04:38,520","04:42,840","\"Like there's- there's not gravity, but there's a universal concept of up.\""]
["04:42,840","04:44,840","\"And it's going up.\""]
["04:44,840","04:48,840","\"And that's why we have what appears to be gravity is because it's-\""]
["04:48,840","04:51,840","\"It's going up and we're going up with- I don't know.\""]
["04:51,840","04:53,840","\"Fuckin'... it's- it's fun.\""]
["04:53,840","04:58,840","\"How come this only flat earthers but not like other shaped earthers?\""]
["04:58,840","05:01,840","\"Like, like emoji smiling laughing face earthers?\""]

["05:16,440","05:18,440","\"I didn't that is not to be spoken of\""]
["05:18,440","05:25,320","\"The society will have your head if they hear about this. I don't care. I'm down. I'm down to die already\""]
["05:25,320","05:31,820","\"Okay, yeah, who isn't at this point? I'm gonna say I'm kind of sick of the red beef threatening my family every other moment\""]

["05:51,120","05:55,940","\"And he threw it into the crowd oh my god, and we had to run in and fucking kick it out of the way and it like\""]
["05:55,940","06:01,260","\"It blew up, but it saved a bunch of people instead of killing a bunch of people that was super brave of you\""]
["06:01,260","06:06,060","\"Yeah, it's really unfortunate that that grenade hit the only camera in the room blew it up\""]
["06:06,060","06:11,740","\"Someone put the fucking camera next to where the grenade was gonna explode. Yeah in the future now idiots\""]
["06:11,740","06:16,100","\"Yeah, Magfest really bad organizing where the camera's gonna be when the grenade explodes, so\""]

["06:35,140","06:41,520","\"Gay and like it's it's kind of messed up to paint all homosexual's as like villains the main example\""]

["07:13,780","07:17,140","\"The character never once implied she was gay to me\""]
["07:17,140","07:22,300","\"So you have to both read into all these characters being gay and then be offended that\""]
["07:22,300","07:26,240","\"there it's a it's an it's like an attempt on like\""]
["07:26,240","07:29,220","\"criminalizing homosexuals where it's like a\""]

["07:39,200","07:42,640","\"I think I think they're like projecting like oh, you know what?\""]
["07:42,640","07:43,660","\"I really like this character\""]
["07:43,660","07:47,700","\"But this movie makes them a villain because they're gay. It's like what fuck you talking about?\""]

["08:09,180","08:13,920","\"It's a good point she does go to try probably the least sympathetic of the Disney villains\""]
["08:13,920","08:19,220","\"Yeah, listen she says her signature catchphrase yum yum. I'm hungry for dogs\""]
["08:19,220","08:22,580","\"No, I got that boy\""]

["13:44,440","13:52,440","\"- Apparent? So in the original PS2 version, they had English voiceover, but for some reason they did not include it in the remake.\""]
["13:52,440","13:54,440","\"- Weird. I prefer it this way.\""]
["13:54,440","14:04,440","\"- A lot of people liked the English voiceover because it was really like awkwardly bad, which sort of added to the whole game.\""]
["14:04,440","14:06,440","\"- Yeah, definitely would contribute to the charm.\""]
["14:06,440","14:08,440","\"- Oh, Salama like, um...\""]
["14:08,440","14:10,440","\"- Oh, man.\""]
["14:10,440","14:14,040","\"They put a weird amount of detail on his eyes, like he has like crow's feet.\""]

["14:30,200","14:34,040","\"Oh, that's like an early like 80s hentai, right?\""]
["14:34,040","14:34,680","\"Kinda, yeah.\""]
["14:34,680","14:39,480","\"Like it's not like entirely sex, but it was...\""]
["14:40,120","14:43,800","\"It had sex I'm pretty sure. Yeah, no, so here's the fucked up thing. Uh,\""]
["14:43,800","14:47,960","\"Wow, it's a movie about like demons and people with like\""]
["14:47,960","14:51,400","\"They use their huge like 40 inch long cut\""]
["14:51,400","14:56,000","\"but not 40 feet long cocks that like are so big they can absorb people into them and\""]
["14:56,000","15:02,640","\"Much other stuff too, but that movie's got like the funniest English dub I've ever heard in my life\""]
["15:02,640","15:09,520","\"Like the is like the old devil man, Doug. I've never seen devil man. Oh my we got a we got a check\""]
["15:09,520","15:14,160","\"Yeah, I've seen the montage of like old Devil Man voice acting.\""]
["15:14,160","15:19,680","\"Yeah, it's pretty sick and it's from about the same era as Urud's kiddo-ji.\""]
["15:19,680","15:23,600","\"Like way before there was a profession of voice acting.\""]
["15:23,600","15:25,480","\"Is it okay for me to wear my shoes in here?\""]
["15:25,480","15:26,360","\"I don't give a shit.\""]
["15:26,360","15:27,560","\"At least for dubbing.\""]
["15:27,560","15:31,920","\"There's this part at the beginning where he's getting bullied by a guy in the basketball court.\""]
["15:31,920","15:36,760","\"And the bully throws a basketball at his face and like makes a little cut on his face.\""]
["15:37,120","15:39,680","\"And then the bully comes over, he's like, \"\"Sorry about that.\"\"\""]
["15:39,680","15:42,120","\"And he like, he leans in and he licks his face.\""]
["15:42,120","15:43,440","\"He's like, \"\"Later?\"\"\""]
["15:43,440","15:45,120","\"You know, it's really fucking weird.\""]
["15:45,120","15:47,440","\"And he goes, \"\"See you later, dick face.\"\"\""]
["15:47,440","15:49,680","\"And he just walks away, it's like a funny shit.\""]
["15:49,680","15:53,120","\"But that movie is full of like horrific like imagery and...\""]
["15:53,120","15:58,000","\"And it's probably the main source of like where I learned how to draw demons and shit when I was a kid.\""]
["15:58,000","16:02,640","\"But uh, my mom bought that movie for me when I was like 12.\""]
["16:02,640","16:04,120","\"Not knowing what it was.\""]
["16:04,120","16:08,340","\"No, she-she-she saw the cover and it's just like a big cool demon. She's like Chris would like that\""]
["16:08,340","16:16,080","\"And it's like the most horrific movie of all time. Did she watch it with you? No, if she-she still doesn't know what she did\""]
["16:16,080","16:23,600","\"But I used to like wait for my friends to come over and I'd be like look at this fucking movie and by the end of the movie\""]
["16:23,600","16:25,600","\"They'd be like what the fuck's wrong with you?\""]
["16:25,600","16:28,120","\"Be like this movie's cool\""]
["16:28,120","16:30,480","\"That's fucking good\""]
["16:30,480","16:34,000","\"But no, I-I-I have the whole original manga\""]
["16:34,000","16:38,000","\"I recommend getting started and translate it recently.\""]
["16:38,000","16:41,000","\"It's like, I think whoever...\""]
["16:41,000","16:45,000","\"That movie is not interesting enough without the English dub.\""]
["16:45,000","16:48,000","\"Like, they really drag out the story and like there's...\""]
["16:48,000","16:52,000","\"I think there's like 40 minutes of unnecessary like, stretching out of the plot\""]
["16:52,000","16:54,000","\"where people will just say the same shit over and over.\""]
["16:54,000","16:57,000","\"But the English dub is what makes it good.\""]
["16:57,000","17:00,000","\"Yeah, it sounds like a fucking treat.\""]
["17:00,000","17:01,000","\"Yeah, you should really watch it.\""]
["17:01,000","17:03,000","\"It's free on YouTube right now.\""]
["17:03,000","17:07,720","\"Like someone uploaded it right what was it? What was that one that like it was dubbed?\""]
["17:07,720","17:13,020","\"By some company where they were just they just went we don't give a shit about this go nuts\""]
["17:13,020","17:17,040","\"And they just put a bunch of like weird racist jokes in there. Oh, I heard about that\""]
["17:17,040","17:21,000","\"So I was just telling me that it's called like ghost stories. I think you're right. Yeah, it was ghost story\""]
["17:21,000","17:23,560","\"Think of a big black man chasing you\""]
["17:23,560","17:30,520","\"They just sort of went to town on the job, yeah, no, I love that kind of shit\""]
["17:31,040","17:35,220","\"Fucking weird that's a really good way to like take something that shit and make it good\""]
["17:35,220","17:43,540","\"Yeah, I feel like there is there was an era where like localization like you just sort of bought the rights\""]
["17:43,540","17:45,540","\"And then you could do whatever you want with it\""]
["17:45,540","17:49,500","\"But lately because like anime's become such an international thing\""]
["17:49,500","17:54,940","\"like the the parent companies want to be involved in like every step of the\""]
["17:55,400","18:01,880","\"The dubbing process so no one can get away with that anymore. Yeah, that's why I like Earth Defense Force is like\""]
["18:01,880","18:08,000","\"It's just fucking like pure unadulterated like intentional garbo shit. It's just all camp\""]
["18:08,000","18:12,800","\"Yeah, I'm sure even the Japanese version is at least somewhat campy\""]
["18:12,800","18:19,880","\"Yeah, it seems like what they did is they translated it verbatim and just kept it like English and all\""]
["18:19,880","18:23,040","\"It's real. It's real fun\""]
["18:23,240","18:26,420","\"I've done voices for a bunch of their defense\""]
["18:26,420","18:31,720","\"I was gonna say oh, yeah, did you get any fucking weird lines to read? I don't remember I'd\""]
["18:31,720","18:36,660","\"Still like probably 75% of it was like a horrified screams\""]
["18:36,660","18:38,800","\"I\""]
["18:38,800","18:46,560","\"Mean a lot of the dialogue is just those are aliens from outer space. They have brought monsters. That's right\""]
["18:46,560","18:51,940","\"That's cool things like that like it's like that caliber of voice acting and I love it\""]
["18:51,940","18:59,580","\"Yeah, get pugsley there you go. I rolled up pugsley\""]
["18:59,580","19:05,540","\"Why'd you give him a name just to just to take him to space? He looks like the guy kid from Adam's family. Oh does he?\""]
["19:05,540","19:10,780","\"Yeah, there's another one. He really did he only just has a striped shirt\""]
["19:10,780","19:15,300","\"Pugsley never wore a hat and I'm pretty sure his stripes were black and white\""]
["19:15,300","19:21,540","\"So this is a case of mistaken identity and this kid has to die for it. I see how it is\""]
