["26:51,740","26:58,540","\"No, like like sourdough was something that did just like form and the way you keep it going once it forms is you just take a little\""]
["26:58,540","27:00,820","\"Piece of the dough and set it aside\""]
["27:00,820","27:07,920","\"And then you keep like peaking off pieces of that so you basically transfer the bacteria from it into your new\""]
["27:07,920","27:10,380","\"dough each time\""]
["27:10,380","27:14,460","\"So every time you make a new dough you let it rise the bacteria\""]
["27:14,820","27:18,820","\"multiplies and then you can keep a piece of it and set it aside for your next loaf. Oh, yeah, that's right\""]
["27:18,820","27:20,820","\"They do that with yogurt. Yeah. Yeah\""]
["27:20,820","27:36,820","\"That's exactly Dark Souls one where you had that thing up on the bridge remember. Yeah, I bet his fire could bake so much bread\""]

["28:12,620","28:13,620","\"What?\""]
["28:13,620","28:14,620","\"So it's the dough?\""]
["28:14,620","28:22,140","\"Yeah, all the rising, everything that makes bread soft and fluffy comes from the bacteria\""]
["28:22,140","28:25,660","\"inside it, because it's respirating.\""]
["28:25,660","28:31,580","\"Well, then how do they make sure that it's only unharmful bacteria?\""]
["28:31,580","28:36,140","\"I mean, if you know what yeast went into it, you know it's not harmful.\""]
["28:36,140","28:38,020","\"Oh, thank God.\""]
