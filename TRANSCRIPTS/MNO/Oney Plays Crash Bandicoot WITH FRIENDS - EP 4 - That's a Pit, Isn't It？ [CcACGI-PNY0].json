["08:44,600","08:50,200","\"Not exactly rubber banding but it would give you opportunities to get back ahead if you made a mistake\""]
["08:50,200","08:52,160","\"No, but I didn't fuck up once there\""]
["08:52,160","08:55,680","\"I know I didn't either when I was playing it at the one point and it still hit me at the end\""]
["08:56,080","09:02,440","\"It's so precise that I think even if you move diagonally it can screw you up fucking bullshit\""]
["09:02,440","09:09,900","\"It's because the creators were boasting about how much they they really enjoyed how difficult and challenging they made it except\""]
["09:09,900","09:17,240","\"I mean, I like difficulty and challenge, but it's it's set it set up in a I noticed this in some games - words like okay\""]

["09:40,500","09:41,040","\"Yeah\""]
["09:41,040","09:49,340","\"And not a thinking of how it'd be conveyed to actual players like having really strict specific jumps that don't make a clear path\""]
["09:49,820","09:54,300","\"You'll see that sometimes in games. There's like pixel-perfect jumps and everything. It's because like oh the\""]
["09:54,300","10:00,020","\"Developers weren't really thinking they just kind of slapped it together because they they're so used to the game engine\""]
["10:00,020","10:02,860","\"They're so familiar with it that the them. It's probably not that\""]
