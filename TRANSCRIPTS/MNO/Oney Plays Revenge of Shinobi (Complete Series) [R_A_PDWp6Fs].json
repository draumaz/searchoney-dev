["01:37,160","01:50,960","\"Okay, I want to explain all the reasons why I love this game first. It's pretty apparent the music\""]
["01:54,440","01:57,400","\"There's no in-between animations so you can do cool stuff like this\""]
["01:57,400","02:06,840","\"Joe moose\""]

["02:52,860","02:55,980","\"I didn't know why I kept losing health every time I got them. You got me\""]
["02:55,980","03:00,120","\"I thought you were supposed to collect them always thought these fuckers look like the putties from Power Rangers\""]
["03:00,120","03:05,180","\"All right, so you should probably set your power to that explosion at the very end over there. Oh, no\""]
["03:05,180","03:07,500","\"I know I know you shouldn't really actually use that unless you're\""]
["03:07,500","03:13,660","\"Unless you have a one-up. Yeah, so okay. You got ninjitsu's you got you can do all sorts\""]
["03:13,660","03:18,980","\"You can do this lightning one which makes it so that you don't get knocked back, which is pretty nice\""]
["03:18,980","03:21,980","\"The lightning makes it frightening. That's that's true too\""]
["03:21,980","03:29,280","\"Die idiot. There's a doggy. Oh, I'm getting hit a lot. I'm sorry. What's the worry man? Sekiro's hard\""]

["03:38,020","03:45,040","\"And the guy who did the music for this game did the music for streets of rage you can tell just fucking awesome music -\""]
["03:45,040","03:50,280","\"It's really good. This is the most hardest part. I love that shit\""]
["03:50,280","03:57,600","\"The sand effects are all silly and I remember this puzzle like the spikes on the ground or the bamboo\""]
["03:57,600","04:00,840","\"It's a little bastard right here. This seems nice and responsive\""]
["04:00,840","04:01,720","\"This is really cool too\""]
["04:01,720","04:05,840","\"How you can like duck and hit people with like shuriken's underneath when they're like blocking\""]
["04:05,840","04:09,220","\"Yeah, so you kind of like goat people into doing attacks and then you can like\""]
["04:09,220","04:12,600","\"Trick them with another oh shit. I landed on the spikes my bed\""]
["04:14,560","04:16,560","\"Yeah, these guys are bastards\""]

["04:22,760","04:24,240","\"Don't worry\""]
["04:24,240","04:30,080","\"Men in this game you're gonna need plenty of them. Yeah, this is a very fucking brutally hard game. See there's power\""]
["04:30,080","04:33,880","\"Yeah, makes your sure you can look all clean. You need all the fucking men you can get\""]
["04:33,880","04:39,120","\"This fucking bastard it is saying go to the left because we've got to go back now. We pulled a switch\""]
["04:39,120","04:41,600","\"Okay, see that little area underneath\""]
["04:41,600","04:48,380","\"This music is so fucking unbelievably godly guessy\""]
["04:48,380","04:53,500","\"So this game reminds me of another Sega Genesis game and people in the studio audience you could probably help me with this\""]
["04:53,500","04:55,940","\"I have fucking no idea what it's called\""]
["04:55,940","04:59,060","\"But you initially start out as like this time-control guy\""]
["04:59,060","05:03,860","\"I mean you go back to like the medieval time and you're like mowing down people in the woods\""]
["05:03,860","05:07,900","\"Which eventually leads you to like a dungeon cavern type area\""]
["05:08,180","05:14,060","\"Where you battle a giant alien where you jump from wall to wall wall you shoot his big fucking alien head\""]
["05:14,060","05:15,320","\"You think about alien syndrome?\""]
["05:15,320","05:17,540","\"I don't know what the fuck it's all cheating Chris\""]
["05:17,540","05:22,360","\"But the next level you fight you go through a you go through a knight like castle\""]
["05:22,360","05:26,820","\"And then you battle this giant robot knight who like throws this fucking hand at you and then brings it back\""]
["05:26,820","05:31,980","\"It's a really good Sega Genesis game, but I don't know what it's called if anyone knows what it's called\""]
["05:31,980","05:37,700","\"I would love to play it. I think that my alien syndrome is it I think so if we look it up on YouTube\""]
["05:37,700","05:42,660","\"I love that game. That's what it is. I'm a phone right now. Look it up. I don't have a phone\""]
