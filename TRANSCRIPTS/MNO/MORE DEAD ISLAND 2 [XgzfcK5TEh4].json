["05:49,040","05:50,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:50,040","05:54,040","\"That's easily the best part of this game so far is just\""]
["05:54,040","05:56,040","\"the way shit reacts when you smack it.\""]
["05:56,040","06:00,040","\"Yeah, the deformation models are top tier.\""]

["06:13,920","06:16,860","\"dead island to support all of\""]
["06:16,860","06:23,180","\"No, oh, so unless you yelled to get zombies attention, that's so stupid. So every time you have to go. Hey Alexa\""]
["06:23,180","06:26,060","\"Yell with the zombie\""]
["06:26,060","06:32,700","\"Maybe it's just always on and recording. Yeah, that's probably what it is. You tell her like Alexa go into dead island mode\""]
["06:32,700","06:37,580","\"And then it's just acts as an unnecessary extra microphone\""]
["06:37,580","06:45,180","\"That has probably too long of a delay because it has to relay back up to amazon servers and back down to your game\""]
["06:46,460","06:48,460","\"No, that's fun. Fuck you.\""]
["06:48,460","06:50,860","\"Oh, what?\""]
["06:50,860","06:54,700","\"It made like an opening sound but didn't open. Oh my god. Yes!\""]

["06:58,860","07:01,460","\"Zaaah!\""]
["07:01,460","07:06,460","\"Oh god. But yeah, they don't flinch it all from blades. Yeah, they don't seem to care.\""]
["07:06,460","07:13,060","\"All right, that is not my preferred play style that I love. Go, Teddy! Go, Teddy!\""]
["07:14,060","07:17,800","\"Oh, you got her head off. Oh, well, they cut your life off\""]
["07:17,800","07:24,340","\"I thought it said it was down in the D-pad to use the the health those four health kits. Oh was it?\""]
["07:24,340","07:29,860","\"Yeah, I've been trying to figure out how to do that. Wait, you still have the sword. So what do you need now? I?\""]
["07:29,860","07:35,700","\"Don't know I don't think that was a stairs. I don't think this was a quest to find the sword\""]
["07:35,700","07:38,660","\"Yeah, just happened to be there. I was hoping there was gonna be another one\""]
["07:38,660","07:43,700","\"Even though I'm not a fan of this weapon. I was just hoping to have to motherfucker\""]
["07:43,700","07:51,280","\"Oh, yeah, that's that's me being yucky zombie infected. I wonder if they're gonna do the fucking\""]
["07:51,280","07:56,600","\"I forget what the other game is called dead by no not dead by daylight\""]
["07:56,600","08:03,340","\"Dying light if they're gonna do the dying light thing and have it be like oh because you're a zombie you're actually stronger\""]
["08:03,340","08:10,900","\"Hmm. Can you throw it through him like a spear? You can throw stuff in this game. Yeah, I don't know if it'll impale on\""]
["08:10,900","08:17,180","\"Let's say try throwing the pool cue. No, that would have been neat. All right. This is just me. Okay, okay\""]
["08:17,180","08:23,760","\"Yeah, okay, but in a zombie game, do you think it's better to have their HP on screen and show you when they're gonna die?\""]
["08:23,760","08:26,580","\"No, right. That's what I feel I\""]
["08:26,580","08:31,500","\"Feel but I also feel like they shouldn't take this many hits. Yeah, yeah\""]
["08:31,500","08:34,580","\"Like I get that that makes it like in dying light\""]
["08:34,580","08:39,420","\"I thought them having high HP kind of made sense because the game is really like stressful and like\""]
["08:40,340","08:44,100","\"Like you really they really do want you to like fear groups of zombies\""]
["08:44,100","08:47,300","\"But in this it's just like a big actiony beat them up sort of game\""]
["08:47,300","08:52,180","\"Well, I feel like it's got like RPG like borderlandsy kind of elements to it. So I\""]
["08:52,180","08:59,980","\"I just like the idea of them going there being more zombies and then going down more easily\""]
["08:59,980","09:07,440","\"Yeah, like if they did realistic damage from if you hit someone like upside the head with a baseball bat\""]
["09:07,440","09:10,440","\"- Yeah, Tomar, this house must cost like $5 million.\""]
["09:10,440","09:14,120","\"I mean, probably more.\""]
["09:14,120","09:15,440","\"- Yeah, you get one, Tomar.\""]
["09:15,440","09:17,920","\"- In California, I feel like $5 million\""]
["09:17,920","09:20,420","\"just gets you a nice four bedroom,\""]
["09:20,420","09:22,600","\"like house maybe near a hill.\""]
["09:22,600","09:26,200","\"- Sources of electricity are found all over LA.\""]
["09:26,200","09:27,840","\"Electricity will pass through water.\""]
["09:27,840","09:29,440","\"Okay, well where's the electricity?\""]
["09:29,440","09:32,160","\"Like we're, oh, here's a plug.\""]
["09:32,160","09:36,640","\"Wait, how do I throw the plug in the,\""]
["09:36,640","09:38,640","\"I\""]
["09:38,640","09:42,960","\"Think it's trying to teach me how to do something. There's just like a thing. They want you to power on\""]
["09:42,960","09:49,940","\"Yeah, maybe there's a bad or you just throw it there you go. That was it. Oh, or you just power the generator, okay?\""]
["09:49,940","09:56,440","\"Wow that person somehow avoided it she's thunderproof\""]
["10:02,240","10:08,740","\"He he good job Lyle you the game becomes instantly more fun once the combat ends\""]
["10:08,740","10:12,260","\"Funny how that works\""]
["10:12,260","10:18,360","\"Yeah, just wailing on the corpses is actually like probably the most fun. I've had with it throw it at her\""]
["10:18,360","10:22,320","\"It just knocked her out\""]
["10:22,320","10:29,040","\"I'm not sure if that's how that works, but I did like it protein bar\""]
["10:30,760","10:35,000","\"He just like knocked her unconscious with the battery and then chucked it at her\""]
["10:35,000","10:38,640","\"There's so much protein in this place\""]
["10:38,640","10:43,400","\"Just trash. No, no, no, no, no, no, man. Oh, she said rubbish\""]
["10:43,400","10:46,520","\"Yeah, she should have actually\""]
["10:46,520","10:52,280","\"That would have been forced that she is Irish to people say trash in Ireland. No well, they say been\""]
["10:52,280","10:57,920","\"They screwed up they call everything been I call everything the bin that's where bin laden came from yeah\""]
["10:58,680","11:01,080","\"They were trying to call them trash-lodden and the\""]
["11:01,080","11:06,920","\"I didn't even see that.\""]
["11:06,920","11:13,520","\"Oh that's happening me now.\""]

["11:16,520","11:17,520","\"Jesus.\""]
["11:17,520","11:19,520","\"Oh see it was down in the deep head.\""]
["11:19,520","11:21,520","\"Wait what does that actually say?\""]
["11:21,520","11:23,280","\"I thought it was like come.\""]

["11:24,280","11:26,520","\"Get out of the fucking, I want to read it.\""]
["11:26,520","11:28,520","\"How do we make the UI disappear?\""]
["11:28,520","11:30,520","\"Ah\""]
["11:30,520","11:34,440","\"Drink is calm\""]

["11:40,520","11:44,160","\"Cool kweh way\""]
["11:44,160","11:51,400","\"I feel like if there's just a little more tuning to the dismemberment who maybe the later later game items are more satisfying\""]
["11:51,400","11:53,400","\"But it stinks that you have to wait\""]
["11:53,400","11:56,120","\"Find the back gate\""]
["11:56,120","12:02,440","\"Okay, that's what I'm supposed to be doing. So this this room is what I'm supposed to be rummaging through. All right, you found it\""]

["12:07,520","12:11,960","\"Oh, I haven't either. You're a good company. But if I hit this will it deflate\""]
["12:11,960","12:17,720","\"Freakin are you kidding me?\""]
["12:17,720","12:25,180","\"That ruined the game. That probably would be really hard to do to be fair, but then also do a realistically deforming like inflatable\""]
["12:25,180","12:29,400","\"It wiggles when you hit it. That's pretty cool, but it doesn't it doesn't\""]
["12:29,400","12:32,580","\"It doesn't\""]
["12:32,580","12:36,700","\"All right, you could bake that animation into it so\""]
["12:36,700","12:41,340","\"Interesting they chose not to do that. Thanks observation Kermit\""]
["12:41,340","12:49,220","\"If they had simply used Houdini to do a simulation if only there had been less republicans working on\""]

["12:59,980","13:10,460","\"Why the hell did they write her he didn't say her oh?\""]
["13:10,460","13:18,260","\"Maybe that was because they that probably is that that is how scripts are usually written and then voice actors choose to talk like real people\""]
["13:18,260","13:23,100","\"Instead of actually reading what's on the page and they shouldn't frankly\""]
["13:23,100","13:26,060","\"They should allow these games all to be for spoken\""]
