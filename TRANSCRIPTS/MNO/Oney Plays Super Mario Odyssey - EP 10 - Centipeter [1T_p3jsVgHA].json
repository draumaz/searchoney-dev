["06:31,520","06:34,720","\"I'd step into the closest room away from it\""]
["06:34,720","06:36,560","\"And I'd hope that I don't die.\""]
["06:36,560","06:37,640","\"Three moons?\""]

["06:58,400","07:00,240","\"Why is Cappy called Cappy if he's a hat?\""]
["07:00,240","07:01,840","\"Because he's a Cappy Barra.\""]

["09:13,440","09:20,000","\"isn't space too. Space 2.0 to be precise. This is Pauline was ashamed of her child\""]

["09:25,760","09:31,440","\"Well, it's they're probably not gonna do it. That's true. Remember they're gonna do a Johnny Bravo movie and that never happened\""]
