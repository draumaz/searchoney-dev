["05:58,120","05:59,120","\"That's a word play.\""]
["05:59,120","06:00,120","\"Meaning is subjective.\""]
["06:00,120","06:02,120","\"Literally just playing with words.\""]
["06:02,120","06:03,120","\"It's blocked.\""]

["06:04,120","06:05,120","\"Get to the word play.\""]
["06:05,120","06:06,120","\"Who's listening?\""]
["06:06,120","06:07,120","\"We create meaning.\""]
["06:07,120","06:10,120","\"Who is to say what a word means?\""]
["06:10,120","06:12,120","\"The dictionary.\""]
["06:12,120","06:13,120","\"That's true.\""]
["06:13,120","06:14,120","\"The dictionary.\""]
["06:14,120","06:16,120","\"Listen, listen to the dictionary.\""]
["06:16,120","06:18,120","\"The dictionary is a social construct.\""]
["06:18,120","06:21,540","\"- That's right, we made up the dictionary.\""]
["06:21,540","06:23,860","\"The dictionary didn't make us up.\""]
["06:23,860","06:25,980","\"- That's true, we created the word,\""]
["06:25,980","06:27,480","\"the brain named itself.\""]
["06:27,480","06:31,740","\"- Here's a brain teaser.\""]
["06:31,740","06:34,660","\"Here's something to really make you think.\""]
["06:34,660","06:39,100","\"The brain is the only organ that thinks about itself.\""]
["06:39,100","06:41,740","\"- The brain is the only organ that looks like,\""]
["06:41,740","06:42,580","\"we get it.\""]
["06:42,580","06:44,900","\"- Wow, I think about Chris and his mom's breasts\""]
["06:44,900","06:46,780","\"and those are organs.\""]
["06:46,780","06:47,620","\"- Whether or not.\""]
["06:47,620","06:49,900","\"I'll say why you're mine because you always get uncomfortable about it\""]
["06:49,900","06:54,720","\"They're all role-plays mad's mom, okay tell yeah\""]
["06:54,720","06:56,900","\"He's gonna edit it\""]
["06:56,900","07:03,220","\"That's why I want to skip on it. You can shoot there, but it's it's hard if you can't really hear it\""]
["07:03,220","07:07,900","\"It's not a joke. Oh, that's right. You told me that I just screwed up so I don't know\""]
["07:07,900","07:12,300","\"I don't need to do this because it's a it's an easy fight, but I don't know save time\""]
["07:12,300","07:16,660","\"Throw the thing\""]
["07:16,660","07:18,660","\"We got nice\""]
["07:18,660","07:21,260","\"You blew that bird right into submission\""]
["07:21,260","07:25,980","\"Because these fights aren't hard because you have all their weaknesses now anyways, but oh\""]
["07:25,980","07:30,980","\"Was that what you collect? Are you supposed to know what the weakness of a bird is it's uh?\""]
["07:30,980","07:37,220","\"Are you just refighting on the old bosses? Yeah, and there's a couple like I know it's common knowledge now\""]
["07:37,220","07:40,260","\"But how did the first person figure it out by playing it a lot?\""]
["07:41,100","07:46,820","\"So you just guess they sometimes make sense like the penguin is weak against fire because it's ice\""]
["07:46,820","07:55,140","\"Yeah, I mean that makes sense. Yeah a lot of things against tornado bird you figure it out. Okay, do the do the wall grab\""]
["07:55,140","08:00,680","\"Do the ground grab do the Homer shake\""]
["08:00,680","08:06,340","\"Ground do the wheel grab wasn't do the Homer shake an actual thing. Yes. Yes\""]
["08:06,700","08:10,260","\"Every single like video that gets uploaded the Simpsons YouTube channel\""]
["08:10,260","08:14,820","\"It's always like missing sound effects and music and it's really creepy and awkward. Really? Yeah\""]
["08:14,820","08:20,420","\"It's because they're like showing like works in progress before the episodes come out really they upload that shit\""]
["08:20,420","08:24,620","\"Well, like they don't market it that way they market it as a clip from the show that's coming out next week\""]
["08:24,620","08:28,500","\"But they never have the sound effects. Oh, yeah, it's awfully done. Yeah, it's just creepy weird. I\""]
["08:28,500","08:35,140","\"Was watching SpongeBob once on TV and only the sound effects traffic. Oh dude did the thing where he had in Spanish\""]
["08:35,780","08:40,500","\"I had that happen to where it's only the sound effects if you have the Spanish audio it just plays the sound effects\""]
["08:40,500","08:43,940","\"Yeah, I didn't know I just turned it on one day and for like every episode\""]
["08:43,940","08:47,860","\"Yeah, that's what it was you had it was just the sound you had the Spanish I had that happen\""]
["08:47,860","08:51,660","\"Why would you say the Spanish and not I don't know I don't know that's what happens though\""]
["08:51,660","08:54,500","\"If you change it to the Spanish audio just play sound effects\""]
["08:54,500","08:57,740","\"It was I didn't realize how many sound effects they actually put into sponge bomb\""]
["08:57,740","09:02,860","\"It's like everything has a sound effect like his nose moving has a sound effect and like every footsteps crazy\""]
["09:02,860","09:05,020","\"This is fun trolls each other sound effect\""]
["09:05,020","09:09,180","\"It was just SpongeBob's breathing.\""]
["09:09,180","09:13,340","\"He slowly looks at the camera.\""]
["09:13,340","09:19,340","\"What about that scary creepy pasta squidward suicide?\""]
["09:19,340","09:23,340","\"What about that scary godmother?\""]
["09:23,340","09:25,340","\"What's she been doing?\""]
["09:25,340","09:29,340","\"That was the scariest creepy pasta.\""]
["09:29,340","09:33,340","\"You're not wall grabbing hard enough.\""]
["09:33,340","09:34,340","\"throw the bomb at him.\""]
["09:34,340","09:35,340","\"I don't want him.\""]
["09:35,340","09:36,340","\"Are you supposed to win this?\""]
["09:36,340","09:38,340","\"Because it doesn't look like they're letting you out.\""]
["09:38,340","09:41,340","\"Are you just supposed to dodge him?\""]
["09:41,340","09:45,340","\"And if you jump, you can shoot.\""]
["09:45,340","09:47,340","\"Like when you're on the wall, you can shoot towards him like that.\""]
["09:47,340","09:48,340","\"This is a tricky one.\""]
["09:48,340","09:50,340","\"You're supposed to go downwards.\""]
["09:50,340","09:53,340","\"I'm using the charge shot because it makes a little barrier around you when you do it.\""]
["09:53,340","09:56,340","\"You'll see like there it goes behind you.\""]
["09:56,340","09:57,340","\"Whoa.\""]
["09:57,340","10:00,340","\"I'm certainly not good at this game.\""]

["10:11,940","10:17,800","\"You probably shouldn't play it, but the second one's pretty good. This is really from 1993. Yep. It's old. I thought it's at four\""]
["10:17,800","10:23,220","\"I know that was the other one. Yeah, I think the third one didn't really have involvement from the original team\""]
["10:23,220","10:25,220","\"Which is why there's a much in it\""]
["10:25,220","10:27,220","\"Don't quote me on that\""]
