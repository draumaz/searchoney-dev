["00:29,500","00:32,500","\"Because one of his is like this guy Chris.\""]
["00:32,500","00:35,760","\"I don't like him.\""]
["00:35,760","00:37,060","\"He freaked me out.\""]
["00:37,060","00:38,880","\"He's like the structure too sometimes.\""]
["00:38,880","00:40,940","\"Oh yeah, it's doing it right now.\""]
["00:40,940","00:43,140","\"I get the pick who I want to be.\""]
["00:43,140","00:43,980","\"There's gum.\""]
["00:43,980","00:45,620","\"She had girl.\""]
["00:45,620","00:47,700","\"I want to look up her score.\""]

["00:51,400","00:55,100","\"She doesn't have-- oh my god, you're right.\""]
["00:55,100","00:56,820","\"You gotta unlock all the characters, though,\""]
["00:56,820","00:58,500","\"and there's like 50 of them.\""]
["00:58,500","00:59,060","\"Really?\""]
["00:59,060","01:01,060","\"There's a lot you even plays a dog\""]
["01:01,060","01:08,740","\"Can I can I spew out an unpopular opinion good you go ahead and san drays is a terrible game?\""]
["01:08,740","01:15,660","\"I like San Andreas go back and play it. Okay. I did recently. I did you play the missions. Yeah\""]
["01:15,660","01:22,620","\"Think they're very very unfun I think for was really unfunning that came out compared to San Andreas\""]
["01:22,620","01:26,160","\"It's less creative for sure, but the game engines boy battery\""]
["01:26,160","01:33,020","\"I don't really like how driving it is because it's focusing it so much more on realism to the point that it's not very fun to do\""]
["01:33,020","01:37,640","\"Anything in it. I say the first one is the best. Did you say one? Yeah?\""]
["01:37,640","01:43,420","\"You know you can't you can't get any better than I honestly do have a fondness for the first two\""]
["01:43,420","01:44,420","\"I think\""]
["01:44,420","01:48,300","\"San Andres had the more fun world what more shit to do but\""]
["01:49,220","01:53,580","\"Shooting and driving well driving in San Andreas fine. It's just a cartoonie or whatever\""]
["01:53,580","01:56,700","\"Four is you write it's too realistic five\""]
["01:56,700","01:58,220","\"It's kind of too cartoony again\""]
["01:58,220","02:03,220","\"I wish there was like a mix between five and four because I do like the weight of the cars and four my only issue\""]
["02:03,220","02:07,540","\"San Andreas is I hate that if you do multiplayer for it. You can't have NPCs going\""]
["02:07,540","02:13,500","\"It's not a dream. Yeah, it's very pretty. Oh San Andreas multiplayer used to be super fun. I\""]
["02:13,500","02:16,780","\"Really like how the cereal looks\""]
["02:17,860","02:23,140","\"Lots of pink pink is a good color. They uh, we got good colors in this game. How about that?\""]
["02:23,140","02:25,800","\"They're pretty good. They can't hear them over the music\""]
["02:25,800","02:33,120","\"That's such a problem that plays so many games and people don't know anything about all your mixins. How's the look at that?\""]
["02:33,120","02:40,860","\"Shadows on her skin or green. We actually picked different colors for like that. Yeah, we were talking about that before\""]
["02:40,860","02:46,780","\"Yeah, a lot of games don't ever do that. It's a great place. Obviously you would know what color theory\""]
["02:46,900","02:52,700","\"Yeah, that like you don't never pick black shadows. Oh, no, this is terrible. Do that. Yeah\""]
["02:52,700","02:57,940","\"You mean when you select a shade that's just more black added to it. Yeah. Yeah, that's bad\""]
["02:57,940","03:03,620","\"That's what most games do so it's nice singing again. Not actually do that. It's got like a ramp. Oh, okay\""]
["03:03,620","03:07,580","\"That that was weird. This is a bad game. I\""]
["03:07,580","03:11,580","\"Never actually see that though. Maybe it's just cuz you're emulating it\""]
["03:11,580","03:16,460","\"I think it is cuz we're playing it on the 360 and on this game acts up like if I pause you can see all the text is flickering\""]
["03:16,460","03:18,460","\"That's supposed to happen Wow I\""]
["03:18,460","03:23,120","\"Thought it was like a flickering light effect is this blondie\""]
["03:23,120","03:28,900","\"Yeah, that's right. They did the this is actually the people did the powerpuff girls credits music remember that\""]
["03:28,900","03:33,700","\"Fighting crime. I like that so I got a lot of you. It's really catchy\""]
["03:33,700","03:36,500","\"Oh, these are the people who did it. I\""]
["03:36,500","03:40,300","\"Wanted to watch the powerpuff girls move in you didn't want to I\""]
["03:40,300","03:45,380","\"Fell asleep watching space jam and you fell asleep. I fell asleep\""]
["03:45,380","03:50,260","\"I couldn't do it. I like the part in space jam when Bill Murray says\""]
["03:50,260","03:59,920","\"That's the high point. I like when Newman gets CGI inflated and it looks really awful. I like I felt sick\""]
["03:59,920","04:04,300","\"Yeah, that's just gross. I don't want to see a fat man get fatter\""]
["04:04,300","04:07,540","\"That's true. I don't\""]
["04:07,540","04:10,900","\"What one missions you think we're good I\""]
["04:12,380","04:17,260","\"I typically don't like missions period in Granthavoto games, but I think San Andreas\""]
["04:17,260","04:19,580","\"had some alright ones.\""]
["04:19,580","04:24,260","\"Everyone always brings up the train, one being awful though.\""]
["04:24,260","04:28,660","\"I liked what I really liked in San Andreas was the flying around in the airplane.\""]
["04:28,660","04:30,940","\"Yeah, no, stuff like that's always really fun in it.\""]
["04:30,940","04:33,300","\"They've come in decent dog fights and shit.\""]
["04:33,300","04:35,340","\"They had a lot of fun stuff to do in it.\""]
["04:35,340","04:39,380","\"That's why I was bummed out that 4 stripped it down so much.\""]
["04:39,380","04:45,180","\"So I hate the fact that the cell phone menu system and everything is really annoying.\""]
["04:45,180","04:48,980","\"They really made the beginning of their games up not just to deal with too.\""]
["04:48,980","04:49,980","\"They're getting worse too.\""]
["04:49,980","04:50,980","\"Yeah, fucking shy.\""]
["04:50,980","04:51,980","\"That's horrible.\""]
["04:51,980","04:52,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:52,980","04:56,740","\"At least in four you're like into the fucking game within like a few minutes.\""]
["04:56,740","04:57,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:57,740","04:59,780","\"You have to wait forever in five.\""]
["04:59,780","05:00,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:00,780","05:04,580","\"At five if you get bored and goof around it restarts the entire thing.\""]
["05:04,580","05:05,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:05,580","05:07,980","\"Oh, it's the worst.\""]
["05:07,980","05:11,460","\"You do that stupid opening then it makes you do Franklin and his friends stealing a car\""]
["05:11,460","05:14,760","\"I think in the cards the words - yeah, it just means don't move\""]
["05:14,760","05:18,860","\"So you have to sit there for like three minutes not moving. Yeah, really boring. Just luck\""]
["05:18,860","05:24,440","\"They always have typically pretty decent protagonists thing the black guy\""]
["05:24,440","05:26,720","\"What was the name Lewis and ballad of gay Tony sucked?\""]
["05:26,720","05:31,620","\"It's boring. I didn't do gay Tony. I always hear people saying it was what he's supposed to be doing\""]
["05:31,620","05:34,460","\"Get Tony was the best of the GTA 4 games for sure. I\""]
["05:34,460","05:37,340","\"Need to be getting up there is what I need to do\""]
["05:37,340","05:40,840","\"And because it's on the 360 you can see the frame rate going down\""]
["05:40,840","05:46,200","\"It's not it wasn't like that on the Xbox this game ran pretty silky smooth usually\""]
["05:46,200","05:50,820","\"We should play conquer live and reload it on the you said you wanted to didn't you know?\""]
["05:50,820","05:56,320","\"I wanted to play the originals. Oh, yeah, because the originals multiplayer is really really good. Oh, that's right\""]
["05:56,320","05:59,180","\"That's what we're gonna suggest to Aaron. Yeah, but Aaron doesn't like conquer\""]
["05:59,180","06:02,060","\"No, they probably wouldn't have been a good we just play with\""]
["06:03,180","06:07,520","\"Yeah, we could do that maybe fun. But Watson the first game's multiplayer is actually really good\""]
["06:07,520","06:10,420","\"And they ended it in last second just like GoldenEye\""]
["06:10,420","06:15,180","\"Remember when Donkey Kong 64 made you have to play the original Donkey Kong\""]
["06:15,180","06:20,420","\"Did it if you had if you wanted to progress through the game you had to play it and you had to set a high score in it\""]
["06:20,420","06:22,920","\"Are you serious? Yes, how did they emulate it? I?\""]
["06:22,920","06:29,520","\"Well, that was why they had it was like oh look we got this going we got the this game working because they they set up an emulator\""]
["06:29,520","06:35,380","\"It's in GoldenEye's source code. They had was a zX spec from I forget what it was. They had an emulator for some PC\""]
["06:35,380","06:37,280","\"How did they do that?\""]
["06:37,280","06:39,960","\"Just by knowing but like you know what you know\""]
["06:39,960","06:43,400","\"You know what you're looking at it to the 64 and an emulator and all the textures are really blurry\""]
["06:43,400","06:46,440","\"They have to build a game from the ground up\""]
["06:46,440","06:51,260","\"It actually turns out because the n64 that was like a key feature that are bragging about is like\""]
["06:51,260","06:54,860","\"Oh, we have this that we can blur textures and everything most games would do it\""]
["06:54,860","06:59,480","\"But people found out that you can turn that off because there's there's a couple of games that you\""]
["06:59,480","07:01,480","\"You have it in the options menu\""]
["07:01,480","07:08,480","\"Yeah, no excited because it was better when you turn it off. It looks ugly. Yeah, it always typically looks pretty ugly, but uh\""]
["07:08,480","07:12,120","\"I didn't know you could turn it off\""]
["07:12,120","07:16,480","\"And some games people have been finding out game shark codes\""]
["07:16,480","07:19,600","\"Because it's built in every game in the actual code\""]
["07:19,600","07:22,240","\"You can disable all of the blurring\""]
["07:22,240","07:28,160","\"So you just get a pixel-perfect clean and by doing that you get to see - there's dithering out everything shading\""]
["07:28,160","07:32,660","\"So games run better if you do that and also they look a like cleaner\""]
["07:32,660","07:35,480","\"It's crazy. I got it because every time I emulated a game\""]
["07:35,480","07:40,360","\"I never saw a game that didn't use that. Yeah, like on everything. It used it on the text and everything\""]
["07:40,360","07:42,480","\"everything\""]
["07:42,480","07:49,040","\"That was that was the big feature of the N64 PS1 didn't have one. Nope. That's crazy\""]
["07:49,040","07:52,040","\"It also had a really bad\""]
["07:52,040","07:57,040","\"Z buffer so you had everything wobbling around all the time the PS1\""]
["07:57,360","08:06,040","\"Yeah, I like that wobble effect. I do too. I like it. It's fun. Some games were good at fighting against it. Like what?\""]
["08:06,040","08:12,080","\"You don't notice that too much in like something that crushed Grandigood. That's true true\""]
["08:12,080","08:15,240","\"Final Fantasy 7 is really back a lot of games\""]
["08:15,240","08:18,560","\"They would try to program something and to fight against it\""]
["08:18,560","08:24,000","\"So I could try to look normal, which is why for a while emulating PS1 games was really inconsistent\""]
["08:24,000","08:26,600","\"Because it was dependent on how they would program that in\""]
["08:26,600","08:28,920","\"But it got a lot better now.\""]
["08:28,920","08:33,240","\"PS1 emulation is always the worst out of everything.\""]
["08:33,240","08:35,680","\"PS2 is pretty bad for a while.\""]
["08:35,680","08:37,240","\"For a while.\""]
["08:37,240","08:38,440","\"It got a lot better.\""]
["08:38,440","08:40,160","\"I am amazed by Dolphin.\""]
["08:40,160","08:41,400","\"Yeah, it's really good.\""]
["08:41,400","08:43,520","\"Dolphin is almost perfect.\""]
["08:43,520","08:44,520","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:44,520","08:46,680","\"Because it dates way back.\""]
["08:46,680","08:51,160","\"The game queue was still going when they first started it, but they really got it going.\""]
["08:51,160","08:53,640","\"And every game supported now, they finally did it.\""]
["08:53,640","08:56,360","\"Every single game supported properly.\""]
["08:56,360","08:57,360","\"Even Wii games.\""]
["08:57,360","08:59,360","\"Yeah, it's really cool.\""]
["08:59,360","09:01,360","\"What do you think of that evil mushroom?\""]
["09:01,360","09:02,360","\"I like it.\""]
["09:02,360","09:03,360","\"Why is he evil?\""]
["09:03,360","09:07,360","\"Oh, is this just a really relaxing game to play?\""]
["09:07,360","09:08,360","\"It is, yeah.\""]
["09:08,360","09:11,360","\"You don't really have to think much, it's just fun.\""]
["09:11,360","09:12,360","\"Looks nice.\""]
["09:12,360","09:13,360","\"Listen to music.\""]
["09:13,360","09:17,360","\"I think that first level was a bit boring looking, but I'm into this.\""]
["09:17,360","09:18,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:18,360","09:21,360","\"You just listen to music and kind of skate around and have fun.\""]
["09:21,360","09:24,360","\"This level has like more fun shit to skate onto.\""]
["09:24,360","09:26,920","\"They have a lot of cool stuff.\""]
["09:26,920","09:27,920","\"You're bad.\""]
["09:27,920","09:29,920","\"This is a wacky bullseye.\""]
["09:29,920","09:33,400","\"It's like so spooky.\""]

["09:35,400","09:36,400","\"It's very rude.\""]

["09:39,400","09:42,240","\"What is he doing?\""]
["09:42,240","09:43,240","\"He's dancing.\""]
["09:43,240","09:44,240","\"He's wearing a gasket.\""]
["09:44,240","09:47,000","\"He's listening to the music.\""]
