["04:33,100","04:41,700","\"That he fades away. How does Hercules get a fuck whoa? There's not in the freaking movie. That's legit. It's pretty cool though\""]

["04:47,620","04:55,020","\"Or for raw XD I want to fill my skirt with precious jewels. I don't know what the fuck is going on here\""]
["04:55,020","05:01,940","\"You've killed those birds. That's actually really satisfying just to look at lightning those birds to death\""]
["05:01,940","05:04,740","\"Yeah, they're made at a glass or something. Yeah, I like it\""]
["05:04,740","05:07,940","\"The background is I mean I was gonna say the\""]
["05:08,420","05:12,440","\"One of the things about a hook is movie is the colors. I think the colors this came up pretty good too\""]
["05:12,440","05:18,440","\"This game looks really fucking good. You're right about this play good or it's a little slow. It's a little\""]
["05:18,440","05:24,260","\"Yeah, well a lot of the time like game animations the smoother. They look actually\""]
["05:24,260","05:26,820","\"Less good they are for you\""]
["05:26,820","05:30,220","\"There's gotta be some sort of some sort of\""]
["05:30,220","05:35,420","\"Formula for like if something yeah, this is well to it. Well, I had a bit of you can't be that response for quick, right?\""]
["05:35,420","05:42,640","\"Yeah for something to actually play good usually the transition should be less than if you break down like fighting game animations and stuff like that\""]
["05:42,640","05:47,840","\"Yeah, like usually it's like one frame. Yeah, usually there's one frame like what it from going from like\""]
["05:47,840","05:50,420","\"Completely still standing position to like\""]
["05:50,420","05:56,840","\"I was too. I mean it seems like a special thing like that, but that's still pretty satisfying watching to do it\""]
["05:56,840","05:59,140","\"I like it. You know that can be sped up a tiny bit\""]
["06:00,420","06:05,120","\"In my little opinion some fucking poor guy slaved on this and you're\""]
["06:05,120","06:11,680","\"Here's what I'm saying cut frames of some say let's say your roofers are saying cut them down from twos to ones\""]
["06:11,680","06:16,320","\"How much we play on the same fucking Disney game you're talking about cutting people\""]
["06:16,320","06:21,680","\"As you are you are you've gone mad these guys aren't even on the same fucking plane is me\""]
["06:21,680","06:24,780","\"This isn't fair last my soul why is that a role?\""]
["06:24,780","06:30,400","\"Bullshitter any sucks on my whole I have never done that these are allegations\""]
["06:30,400","06:34,400","\"Come at me come come at me. I'll come over you\""]
["06:34,400","06:40,260","\"Oh fuck how come you can't do that to the birds? How can we can't do the day to be though?\""]
["06:40,260","06:45,880","\"I think you can it's just probably not advice. There's a glitch of this game where that guy works in the day to be to himself\""]
["06:45,880","06:52,880","\"It's true. It's real at the end of this level. He makes Hercules uses super strength to tear the head off an elk\""]
["06:54,640","06:58,920","\"Hold it down. It's really uncomfortable. I would love to see someone do that. I would love the I love the always\""]
["06:58,920","07:02,200","\"I didn't feel the offer you for that would be just they can't do ripping the head off an animal\""]
["07:02,200","07:04,800","\"I was oh my god. We can't we can't really\""]
["07:04,800","07:07,760","\"Charlie day just steps on a raccoon\""]
["07:07,760","07:11,160","\"Dude, this is this is where baby X\""]
["07:11,160","07:15,940","\"I would say I got irrationally mad one time watching that show because no it was one of the first times\""]
["07:15,940","07:19,780","\"I ever watched the show and it was the episode where Charlie Dave bites the nose off of Santa Claus\""]
["07:19,780","07:21,720","\"That was my first experience\""]
["07:21,720","07:26,440","\"I think was this what you is this because I think I remember a point where you hated that show because based off the Christmas episode\""]
["07:26,440","07:27,480","\"It was that one, you know\""]
["07:27,480","07:31,240","\"Because I was like how do people fucking like this show if the main characters biting the noses off\""]
["07:31,240","07:37,800","\"Yeah, that Christmas episode is ridiculous that I think I think season four like four and five of that show were like perfect\""]
["07:37,800","07:41,280","\"Comedy TV. Yeah, I think six and seven or whatever it'd be on a great\""]
["07:41,280","07:46,320","\"But I think four and five are probably literally just perfect. Yeah. No, I love that show. It's great\""]
["07:46,320","07:51,480","\"Actually, no, the first time I watched it was with my friend and it was the Jersey show episode\""]
["07:51,480","07:56,160","\"Then after that it was the nose up it just seems like they have a lot of fun with it\""]
["07:56,160","07:58,160","\"Which is always a good quality\""]
["07:58,160","08:02,720","\"They actually they actually just do stupid shit like the guy who plays fucking Mac when he was just like dude\""]
["08:02,720","08:04,720","\"We should all get fat for a season everyone\""]
["08:04,720","08:07,760","\"And then he was like I'm gonna do it anyway fuck you guys\""]
["08:07,760","08:13,000","\"I read this yesterday that they asked David you know get ripped for the season\""]
["08:13,000","08:17,240","\"He was like I'm not gonna do that really they asked David a good fucking Jack for the season\""]
["08:17,240","08:24,740","\"If he's like 73, I can't it would have been funny, but that would have been amazing. I love that he would look scary like that\""]
["08:24,740","08:26,740","\"He'd be horrible\""]
["08:26,740","08:31,240","\"Also, like I don't know if you're Danny DeVito and you go your whole life looking like that\""]
["08:31,240","08:36,240","\"And then you get in the best shape of your life at like 70 something for a joke. Yeah\""]
["08:36,240","08:42,140","\"That would fuck with your psychology somehow. I would assume it's also sort of see people are sort of laughing at him\""]
["08:42,140","08:47,980","\"Because it's like you look stupid fucking but to a degree I'd get not wanting to be like ripped as a as a gag\""]
["08:47,980","08:51,380","\"Yeah, we're doing for help at the same time. It would be really fucking funny\""]
["08:51,380","08:55,440","\"If he ever gets like fucking out it as a piece of shit\""]
["08:55,440","08:59,440","\"I'm gonna be very sad. I will be really depressed if that happens cuz I love him\""]
["08:59,440","09:00,320","\"I love me\""]
["09:00,320","09:06,280","\"Mitala and I love him in that show. He's a great actor. God damn it. That's your day. Do you know sweaty attack?\""]
["09:08,780","09:13,740","\"Do you see a recty this fucking shill you pussy? I fucking hate these birds\""]
["09:13,740","09:16,740","\"Yeah, you've done it\""]
["09:16,740","09:24,020","\"Huzzah, thanks man. Oh, he really gets into the mind of Hercules, you know, what's he thinking right now?\""]
["09:24,020","09:31,000","\"I don't actually if I was him the first thing I would be thinking about is just can I get away with killing people?\""]
["09:31,000","09:34,900","\"Could he's killed like giant the serpents. Yeah, I\""]
["09:35,700","09:41,220","\"Mean I guess who would bring him in right that would make him more of an interesting character if he took over like a city\""]
["09:41,220","09:45,620","\"And just held everyone hostage liquid super big killed somebody there's that whole fucking story\""]
["09:45,620","09:51,260","\"You know the injustice that you see injustice shit that why don't they keep making shitty fucking movies?\""]
["09:51,260","09:53,260","\"Why didn't they make that into a movie right?\""]
["09:53,260","09:57,940","\"Superman's the bad guy you know what you know what they should do it. Did you see the new fucking?\""]
["09:57,940","10:00,420","\"T titans live action trailer\""]
["10:03,140","10:07,300","\"Yeah, that's why they should do something dog. They fucking stick in it. Yeah. No, no, no\""]
["10:07,300","10:12,460","\"But that game is like like it's dark, but it's like it's still in that comic-kind of aesthetic\""]
["10:12,460","10:15,460","\"Would not do that. Well, I don't think I mean try it for God's sake\""]
["10:15,460","10:20,340","\"I guess they really managed to fuck up and knew in interesting ways constantly over there\""]
["10:20,340","10:25,400","\"Dude, I I even even fucking\""]
["10:25,400","10:29,560","\"Batman v super was supposed to be dark and it just stuck\""]
["10:29,560","10:33,480","\"Batman v Superman is genuinely one of the worst fucking movies I've ever seen\""]
["10:33,480","10:39,520","\"I agree with you. I'd go so far as to say all those movies are supposed to be dark and edgy even fucking\""]
["10:39,520","10:44,620","\"I think Batman versus Superman's a really good movie to watch in the background\""]
["10:44,620","10:50,560","\"I would I would recommend that movie to people is like a so bad. It's good movie if it was a fucking hour shorter\""]
["10:50,560","10:52,520","\"Yeah, if it was an hour shorter\""]
["10:52,520","10:58,400","\"There's their shit like that is like oh, yeah, Lex Luthor feeds a guy a licorice and then he's fucking allowed to\""]
["10:58,920","11:04,680","\"Get access to the Superman ship or like like Lex Luthor fills a jar of peepee and then blows up\""]
["11:04,680","11:08,000","\"Forget why you say that oh yeah\""]
["11:08,000","11:14,900","\"It's not Batman. It's Superman. He says that why did it is Batman. Oh, he's been here like Superman\""]
["11:14,900","11:20,740","\"Superman for some reason blurs out his own mother's first name and then Batman goes\""]
["11:23,280","11:28,260","\"He doesn't even say it's his mommy's name lowest lane fucking gets on a helicopter out of nowhere\""]
["11:28,260","11:33,240","\"That flies in and then it runs into the building and goes that's his mommy's name\""]
["11:33,240","11:35,960","\"And then they fucking\""]
["11:35,960","11:39,160","\"Why did you say boy that that's his mommy's name?\""]
["11:39,160","11:41,540","\"That's what always they drew that movie had some cool shit\""]
["11:41,540","11:47,360","\"It though my favorite part of that movie is when fucking Batman hits Superman over the head with a toilet\""]
["11:47,360","11:52,720","\"And then picks up floppy Superman and gingerly lobs him over a stairwell\""]
["11:52,720","11:59,620","\"That's that's my foot like it's a good idea only if that movie was an hour shorter\""]
["11:59,620","12:01,620","\"It would be so bad that it's funny\""]
["12:01,620","12:07,920","\"But somehow it just manages to be really boring after after a certain bar could you just what a fucking oh?\""]
["12:07,920","12:10,020","\"I\""]
