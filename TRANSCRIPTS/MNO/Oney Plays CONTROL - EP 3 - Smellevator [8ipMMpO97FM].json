["02:34,040","02:38,360","\"Every time I listen to ASMR, I always get a big ol' stiffy.\""]
["02:38,360","02:42,200","\"People who do ASMR always look like weird, like, albino-sun mutants.\""]
["02:42,200","02:43,240","\"That's not true!\""]
["02:43,240","02:48,840","\"There's so many people that do ASMR that is a weird general session.\""]

["03:04,440","03:06,040","\"-You happen to have a American accent?\""]
["03:06,040","03:12,840","\"-Because one of my first ASMR videos I discovered before I knew what the ASMR even was...\""]
["03:12,840","03:14,840","\"-This already sounds like a sexual awakening.\""]
["03:14,840","03:18,840","\"-Is that... Have I ever brought up Bjork talking about her TV?\""]
["03:18,840","03:20,840","\"-Bjork is fucking beautiful.\""]
["03:20,840","03:25,680","\"But there's that video of her talking about her television and it's at it's completely asinine\""]
["03:25,680","03:28,720","\"Which is why it was so good at relaxing me\""]
["03:28,720","03:34,280","\"She's got a nice voice. It's just her talking about she opens up\""]
["03:34,280","03:42,000","\"We're going to go look inside the TV the television and we're going to find out how it operates\""]
["03:42,000","03:47,700","\"This is a million and millions of little screens. I never told you but you know the Bjork stalker\""]
["03:47,700","03:52,340","\"Mm-hmm. I was the guy who got him into Bjork in the first place. Are you serious?\""]

["03:59,960","04:05,960","\"You just always wanted credit for the Bjork stalker. I don't want credit for it, but I might as well own up to it\""]
["04:05,960","04:08,180","\"That's fair\""]
["04:08,180","04:10,340","\"Look, we all make Bjork stalker sometimes\""]
["04:16,080","04:21,200","\"Where's the elevator the name is Bjork and I am from Portugal and I am your biggest fan\""]
["04:21,200","04:24,200","\"Shut up York\""]
["04:24,200","04:29,840","\"Isn't almost like you have like a map or something Tomar maybe Tomar you don't\""]
["04:29,840","04:36,620","\"It don't use the map from dome you are a big I'm kind of a hardcore elite gamer and we don't use maps\""]
["04:36,620","04:45,360","\"You're a screw squir\""]
["04:45,360","04:48,520","\"Do you ever get an elevator full of people and you shout\""]
["04:48,520","04:51,200","\"Smellivator and you shit yourself and everyone gets really mad\""]
["04:51,200","04:53,560","\"And then you hit the fucking emergency stop\""]
["04:53,560","05:01,320","\"Elevator falls to the bottom floor. It looks like the elevator would be here. What what's going on a huge fucking fire explosion of feces?\""]
["05:01,320","05:07,320","\"Yeah, the new walk home is like a burnt leg pink like melting guy\""]
["05:07,320","05:13,160","\"Then you tell a story you're like, oh, man, I played the funniest prank\""]
["05:14,320","05:31,900","\"the elevator. I think that guy's supposed to be a Dracula. Oh god damn it. Pony.\""]
["05:31,900","05:37,720","\"Let's say pony. You say pony Walkman. That's these clearly very poor to have\""]
["05:37,720","05:41,080","\"to fucking resort by that. Do you think it just says Sony in the PlayStation\""]
["05:41,080","05:49,540","\"version about it. It says Sony computer entertainment. You're presents a naughty dog production\""]
["05:49,540","05:55,580","\"Is that a reference to something in particular crash band? Really crash bandacoot is European\""]
["05:55,580","06:01,800","\"huh? No, that's just the version I heard growing up. Oh, I see. Was it made in Santa\""]
["06:01,800","06:07,960","\"Monica then? Where was crash made? I don't know. It wasn't California somewhere. There's\""]
["06:07,960","06:12,520","\"There's like a weird phenomenon where Crash Bandicoot is actually like really really popular in Europe.\""]
["06:12,520","06:15,760","\"For some reason, 'cause I do pregame discharge.\""]
["06:15,760","06:17,760","\"Are you talking about the Smash Brothers charts?\""]
["06:17,760","06:30,040","\"No, but well, I mean that also, but like, there's like this regular story that keeps cropping up where like the insane trilogy keeps topping UK sales charts even when new games come out and shit like that.\""]
["06:30,040","06:33,640","\"Yeah, people, everyone I knew fucking grown up had Crash.\""]
["06:33,640","06:36,560","\"You'd also think like they would have all bought it by now.\""]
["06:36,560","06:42,920","\"That's a fair point like it's weird it is weird they've all agreed to like\""]
["06:42,920","06:47,660","\"Continuously yeah, yeah to just buy a copy every month\""]
["06:47,660","06:51,660","\"It's just so use me just so they'll get more sequels I\""]
["06:51,660","06:57,980","\"Guess they've got to be working on another one right there's no fucking way they wouldn't be\""]
["07:01,400","07:05,080","\"I'm excited if they work on a new one. That'd be good. I\""]
["07:05,080","07:13,680","\"Feel like that that game sold well enough and same with like crash team racing that it would be dumb for them to not make another one\""]
["07:13,680","07:15,680","\"I have a bad feeling though. Oh\""]
["07:15,680","07:19,400","\"Yeah, cuz like they went another way to include these fucking\""]
["07:19,400","07:21,160","\"hideous\""]
["07:21,160","07:27,400","\"Green dudes in crash team racing. So I have a feeling that they're gonna want to like, you know put the shitty like\""]
["07:28,120","07:34,380","\"Weird characters in season. Yeah like from like traveler's tales and like all the other shitty companies that I've owned it\""]
["07:34,380","07:40,940","\"Hmm, so I have hopefully that they don't do that because I like the the aesthetic of the first three games where it's like\""]
["07:40,940","07:45,160","\"The mutated island but not with like these weird fucking green things\""]
["07:45,160","07:46,840","\"Right\""]
["07:46,840","07:53,040","\"Yeah, well, I mean they made the they have to completely rebuild the engine for the insane trilogy. Yeah, so\""]
["07:53,040","07:57,460","\"Now that they have it it would only make sense that they would be able to just make another one\""]
["07:57,460","08:03,240","\"There's a problem you run into when you make games like that where like the first game is is mostly based on an island with like some\""]
["08:03,240","08:06,180","\"fucking\""]
["08:06,180","08:10,780","\"Machinery elements right yeah because of cortex right the second game. They're like we need up the auntie\""]
["08:10,780","08:16,500","\"So now they go into fucking space near the end of it right third game is like shit. We went into space now\""]
["08:16,500","08:21,220","\"We're gonna go travel through time and then after that like what else can you really fucking do?\""]
["08:21,220","08:25,000","\"There's not much else you can do crash slaves God\""]
["08:25,000","08:37,000","\"But like there's no new real level ideas they can come up with that they haven't done before because they've gone to space and through time\""]
["08:37,000","08:42,000","\"Yeah, that's fair. They'd have to go into just like a weird surreal dimension, but that would get old fast\""]
["08:42,000","08:50,420","\"Nice that is such a cool effect Omar. I'm so glad you go to that. Can you just did any yeah good job?\""]
["08:50,420","08:55,820","\"But can you at any point since you know this game so well can you just pull out floor concrete?\""]
["08:55,820","09:00,780","\"Is that what you were doing? Yeah, like if it doesn't see an image, it'll just yeah\""]
["09:00,780","09:07,260","\"Grab shit out of the floor. That's amazing. I mean, you know, I mean if it's not focused on an object, right?\""]

["09:16,940","09:22,780","\"It is he's singing something in his native town. He is a poster of himself on the door. What a fucking psycho\""]
["09:22,780","09:27,580","\"Oh, he's gonna be a Dracula\""]

["11:11,260","11:15,660","\"dollars put into it but that doesn't mean the gameplay is good to learn this\""]
["11:15,660","11:19,900","\"fucking text is really on the screen right now it's not good gameplay I'm\""]
["11:19,900","11:24,980","\"explaining that that is literally a tweened object you can do that in flash\""]
["11:24,980","11:30,300","\"since 2004 dude well how about explain fuck her up that that's a party cool\""]

["12:31,780","12:36,720","\"Feel bad for them if they like put a particle effect of shit coming out of his ass for the whole game\""]
["12:36,720","12:39,500","\"Yeah, imagine that\""]
["12:39,500","12:46,300","\"That'd be fun to just like cast people you've met in real life and don't like and then just fucking make him look silly\""]
["12:46,300","12:48,500","\"Make him walk around constantly shitting in the game\""]
["12:48,500","12:51,940","\"It's probably a good idea\""]
