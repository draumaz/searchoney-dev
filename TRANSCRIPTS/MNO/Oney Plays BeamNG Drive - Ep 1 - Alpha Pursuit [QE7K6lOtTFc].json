["00:04,360","00:05,800","\"With friends.\""]
["00:05,800","00:07,140","\"Look at this game.\""]
["00:07,140","00:08,200","\"This is Beam.\""]
["00:08,200","00:09,040","\"Is this real?\""]
["00:09,040","00:10,240","\"Beam Newgrounds Drive.\""]
["00:10,240","00:11,180","\"Is this Google Maps?\""]
["00:11,180","00:11,800","\"Yes.\""]
["00:11,800","00:13,360","\"This is real.\""]
["00:13,360","00:14,560","\"BeamNG.\""]
["00:14,560","00:17,560","\"I can't wait till we get to the point where we can import Google Maps\""]
["00:17,560","00:20,080","\"for level design.\""]
["00:20,080","00:23,600","\"Maybe I should kind of need-- you want to do--\""]
["00:23,600","00:25,000","\"this is shit.\""]
["00:25,000","00:26,960","\"Censeless destruction.\""]

["00:29,000","00:29,520","\"Love it.\""]
["00:29,520","00:35,740","\"Have you played this before cross very very briefly look delivery you got to do pizza delivery Chris\""]
["00:35,740","00:37,640","\"Where's that this is the top middle one?\""]
["00:37,640","00:44,240","\"Mmm, this is a homage to your first job. You know there's oni and gee. Have you heard of beam in gee?\""]
["00:44,240","00:47,240","\"That's my light base brother. Yeah\""]
["00:47,240","00:55,520","\"Look a fucking lot. This is like the Sims. I'm offended do not offend from when the sim said all that bullshit at the bottom like\""]
["00:55,520","00:57,840","\"articulating splines yeah\""]
["00:58,280","01:03,660","\"Giving sims remember their tongues. I've heard rumors that you can speak simones\""]
["01:03,660","01:14,120","\"Why does everyone sound like a horny\""]
["01:14,120","01:26,520","\"Well, we can make fun of a made-up language without being accused of being racist, okay, we're gonna take advantage\""]
["01:27,080","01:32,280","\"Fuck is going on here. What is happening to your screen? Whoa? What in the world? What the fuck?\""]
["01:32,280","01:39,040","\"Nice car. This is me this street goes through your car. What's wrote the graphics? What is happened?\""]
["01:39,040","01:47,220","\"Crash is there sound I thought I heard a little sound in the fun. Let me do all right now. We're in\""]
["01:47,220","01:51,040","\"It says your name on the the little only\""]
["01:51,040","01:53,720","\"That's so cute look at this\""]
["01:55,560","01:59,720","\"See it's got like real good physics. Yeah, that looks great. Yeah\""]
["01:59,720","02:05,620","\"But now let's see let's see what this mission is just how you really drive deliver pizza deliver the pizza\""]
["02:05,620","02:09,920","\"Wait, is there really no pizza that's just like a waypoint?\""]
["02:09,920","02:15,240","\"It just kind of tells you which way to go. It's just gonna make you drive down this narrow alley already go\""]
["02:15,240","02:19,040","\"Okay, let's go. Let's give this a go. I like the car sound\""]
["02:19,040","02:24,640","\"So I'm supposed to try like one of the developers just did\""]
["02:24,640","02:30,580","\"I just Austin powers myself\""]
["02:30,580","02:37,200","\"All right the most ones you deliver good a pizza\""]
["02:37,200","02:40,260","\"The pizza's getting cold\""]
["02:40,260","02:48,040","\"Why would you fucking drive around in this to deliver pizzas went out of moped is this supposed to be Europe or San Francisco?\""]
["02:48,040","02:50,040","\"It looks just like Europe\""]
["02:51,040","02:59,820","\"Looks like all of your yeah, this is in San Francisco. Yeah, it's not Jesus Christ. It's not up stop fail\""]
["02:59,820","03:07,240","\"And stop what why did it wait what happened? It failed me for that what happened? I'm just reverse. Yeah, exactly\""]
["03:07,240","03:12,080","\"I don't know it's stupid. I guess in real life if you were in the middle of an intersection\""]
["03:12,080","03:14,520","\"I feel like you're gonna kind of fail in life\""]
["03:14,520","03:19,880","\"I guess I would have just like if I saw a man drive up to me with a pizza and just drove one meter past me\""]
["03:19,880","03:21,880","\"Would just run back inside\""]
["03:21,880","03:29,320","\"He'd run up to you with the pizza and you slap it out of his hand. No stop stop\""]
["03:29,320","03:34,160","\"Grazie go ahead see I guess it's supposed to be somewhere in Italy, okay?\""]
["03:34,160","03:39,640","\"Wow, that's not racist at all only people in Italy pizza, please\""]
["03:39,640","03:43,040","\"That is fucked up to even assume such please\""]
["03:43,040","03:49,800","\"Look at this. I'm actually really good see see oh nice drift see see oh see you\""]
["03:49,800","03:52,400","\"Can you populate this town with people?\""]
["03:52,400","03:55,100","\"That would be nice, but I don't think so.\""]
["03:55,100","03:55,600","\"Look, I'm-\""]
["03:55,600","03:57,600","\"Or other cars? Wait, why are you-\""]
["03:57,600","03:59,100","\"Is this the apocalypse?\""]
["03:59,100","04:03,100","\"There's like no people, no cars, nobody's in the business.\""]
["04:03,100","04:04,600","\"And it's broad daylight.\""]
["04:04,600","04:06,100","\"It is broad daylight.\""]
["04:06,100","04:08,100","\"I don't even want to finish this boring mission.\""]
["04:08,100","04:09,100","\"Yeah, let's-\""]
["04:09,100","04:10,100","\"Is there like-\""]
["04:10,100","04:10,100","\"Is there like-\""]
["04:10,100","04:11,100","\"Is there like-\""]
["04:11,100","04:12,100","\"Is there like-\""]
["04:12,100","04:13,100","\"Is there like-\""]
["04:13,100","04:14,100","\"Is there like a demolition derby mode?\""]
["04:14,100","04:19,600","\"Is there like a demolition derby mode?\""]
["04:19,600","04:20,960","\"Let's try a better scenario.\""]
["04:20,960","04:23,600","\"It's like my face when I shove it into the corner of a desk.\""]
["04:23,600","04:24,400","\"We got Canyon.\""]
["04:24,400","04:25,560","\"You want to do Canyon jump?\""]
["04:25,560","04:25,760","\"Sure.\""]
["04:25,760","04:27,840","\"Sounds pretty cool.\""]
["04:27,840","04:30,360","\"You might as well just make a Canyon jump pizza delivery,\""]
["04:30,360","04:33,680","\"because like all it is is you driving from one point to another.\""]
["04:33,680","04:34,120","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:34,120","04:39,280","\"Oh, wait, there's the controllers reset physics, throttle, page up, break.\""]
["04:39,280","04:40,920","\"Does that say page down?\""]
["04:40,920","04:42,320","\"What?\""]
["04:42,320","04:44,480","\"Oh, no, says arrow up.\""]
["04:44,480","04:45,640","\"Can you change gravity?\""]
["04:45,640","04:47,600","\"Maybe.\""]
["04:47,600","04:47,880","\"I don't know.\""]
["04:47,880","04:49,880","\"I want you to fly to the moon.\""]
["04:49,880","04:50,800","\"We can try it.\""]
["04:50,800","04:52,840","\"That would be the best simulator.\""]
["04:52,840","04:54,280","\"I know there's some weird options you could\""]
["04:54,280","04:56,000","\"fuck with, there might be gravity in there.\""]
["04:56,000","04:57,320","\"I think wouldn't that be a fun simulator\""]
["04:57,320","04:59,440","\"where you're on earth and there's a ramp,\""]
["04:59,440","05:01,600","\"but you gotta hit it at the right angle and speed\""]
["05:01,600","05:04,240","\"in order to reject yourself into the moon?\""]
["05:04,240","05:06,240","\"Yeah, that would be a fucking awesome game.\""]
["05:06,240","05:07,320","\"But like, you know, you gotta take it\""]
["05:07,320","05:11,160","\"into gravitational pull and like certain things, go.\""]
["05:11,160","05:13,800","\"Like a slight gravitational go for that ramp.\""]
["05:13,800","05:14,640","\"For the ramp?\""]
["05:14,640","05:15,480","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["05:15,480","05:16,320","\"This is it.\""]
["05:16,320","05:17,160","\"Oh!\""]
["05:17,160","05:22,760","\"It's a really rocky the tired deflated you got this you got this yeah\""]
["05:22,760","05:28,460","\"Is this slum or is this real time?\""]
["05:28,460","05:37,520","\"Sorry oh no you did not survive this Chris oh so fucking cool looking I\""]
["05:37,520","05:43,240","\"Love those physics okay, we got good. All right. This is it. Oh, that's it Chris. Holy shit. This is it\""]
["05:43,240","05:45,240","\"Oh my god\""]
["05:45,240","05:57,640","\"Man there's a baby on board. There's nobody driving that. There's a little tiny toddler stepping on the\""]
["05:57,640","06:03,560","\"Steering\""]
["06:03,560","06:07,760","\"No, I'm not on the fucking yeah the pedals\""]
["06:08,240","06:12,880","\"No, check this time. I'll do it. You got this that angle shift when you go up the ramp is all fucked up\""]
["06:12,880","06:16,480","\"This is it. This is it you got this Chris. Oh, yeah, it is good. Let's go straight\""]
["06:16,480","06:21,680","\"Still not nearly in a scotch\""]
["06:21,680","06:24,240","\"I'm supposed to get so much speed\""]
["06:24,240","06:29,360","\"I guess try to do a loop the harder they try to go further back the higher they\""]
["06:29,360","06:36,440","\"Launch the harder they fall exactly young man. Yeah, how do you get that full? Yeah?\""]
["06:36,440","06:38,780","\"Do some donuts. Oh, look at this. Oh, there you go\""]
["06:38,780","06:44,780","\"This is your ramp, but just watch out because when you hit those rocks at this speed Chris you don't even know\""]
["06:44,780","06:48,800","\"I'm just saying like I'm an expert driver and I'm like in in like movies and shit\""]
["06:48,800","06:50,900","\"Chris can we do this is feel like so real\""]
["06:50,900","06:52,900","\"After the stream oh fuck\""]
["06:52,900","07:01,680","\"I couldn't fuck that I'm doing it. You can still live. Oh\""]
["07:01,680","07:04,640","\"Engine broken oh\""]
["07:04,640","07:06,360","\"*Coughing*\""]
["07:06,360","07:07,740","\"Keep going! Go go go!\""]
["07:07,740","07:08,240","\"Fuck!\""]
["07:08,240","07:09,340","\"Ahhh!\""]
["07:09,340","07:10,340","\"Ohh!\""]
["07:10,340","07:11,140","\"Wheel down!\""]
["07:11,140","07:11,840","\"Ohh! Oh no!\""]
["07:11,840","07:12,940","\"Wait, I can still turn it!\""]
["07:12,940","07:13,440","\"Wait!\""]
["07:13,440","07:14,740","\"Did you get in stone control?\""]
["07:14,740","07:17,140","\"Well, the engine's dead, but he can still...\""]
["07:17,140","07:19,640","\"The sh- the- the steering's the right!\""]
["07:19,640","07:20,940","\"Hey, Chris, you failed.\""]
["07:20,940","07:21,940","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["07:21,940","07:23,440","\"Let's try one more time.\""]
["07:23,440","07:24,140","\"Do you want to have a go?\""]
["07:24,140","07:27,640","\"No, dude, I already- those controls look way too complicated.\""]
["07:27,640","07:29,340","\"It's just up, down, left, right.\""]
["07:29,340","07:30,140","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["07:30,140","07:32,940","\"Like I said, those controls are way too complicated.\""]
["07:32,940","07:33,840","\"Goodbye!\""]
["07:33,840","07:38,480","\"I'm it okay, okay, okay, sorry. I need it slow and steady wins the race\""]
["07:38,480","07:44,800","\"Yeah, you know you're so back up well technically no, or you do need some speed but it's that old ancient proverb\""]
["07:44,800","07:52,620","\"Yes, tortoise win the race, you know did you hear a shad was telling me the other version of that story really German version\""]
["07:52,620","07:55,600","\"There's a German version. Yeah, it's the the hair and the hedgehog\""]
["07:55,600","07:58,040","\"This is real really yeah\""]
["07:59,000","08:03,740","\"So apparently you know how like slow and steady wins the raise the story of the tours in the hair\""]
["08:03,740","08:06,400","\"It's about yes, you got it go hold on\""]
["08:06,400","08:08,960","\"Yes, Chris\""]
["08:08,960","08:20,720","\"You know if if you were in the privacy you might have been launched through the windshield and survived that Jesus\""]
["08:20,720","08:26,880","\"So the story goes fuck this thing story goes in in the in the hair and the hedgehog\""]
["08:27,560","08:28,800","\"Yeah\""]
["08:28,800","08:34,080","\"There's a hair and he's he wears a monocle and he's a real condescending rich asshole\""]
["08:34,080","08:40,260","\"Hmm and the hedgehog is this very common kind of like farmer type blue collar person\""]
["08:40,260","08:46,140","\"Yeah, and he's married to another hedgehog who apparently looks identical to him because I guess that's something yeah\""]
["08:46,140","08:53,420","\"Anyways, so he keeps he keeps telling the hair like the hair is like oh I'm so much better than you you fucking suck your\""]
["08:53,420","08:55,220","\"Hedgehog however\""]
["08:55,220","08:58,980","\"The hedgehogs like cool man. How about we race and the hair is like yeah, you got it\""]
["08:58,980","09:02,740","\"But then he keeps having his wife go to the finish line\""]
["09:02,740","09:06,340","\"So then every time the hair approaches the finish line\""]
["09:06,340","09:10,380","\"He tries to go faster and faster, but he obviously can't catch up\""]
["09:10,380","09:14,980","\"So they keep racing and he keeps like wanting a do-over until finally he kills himself\""]
["09:14,980","09:20,820","\"That's the end of the story and then the two and then the two dance on his grave literally dance on his grave\""]
["09:21,540","09:25,340","\"That sounds way more fun. So the entire time the hedgehog is just like\""]
["09:25,340","09:30,740","\"Psychologically like fucking. Oh, yeah, but like the whole I guess the point was\""]
["09:30,740","09:39,360","\"If you are rich and you are powerful do not look down on the peasants because they can be smart, too\""]
["09:39,360","09:43,900","\"Yeah, that's the story, but I love how it's the complete opposite of the tortoise in the hair\""]
["09:43,900","09:49,620","\"Which was about working hard keeping your nose down just you know keep drive and keep going you know\""]
["09:49,660","09:56,620","\"See I feel like this narcissist character the hair like one of the first things he do is assume that he was getting played\""]
["09:56,620","09:58,620","\"If he was losing to this guy\""]
["09:58,620","10:04,980","\"He'd hire a PI who would very quickly discover the whole like wife plot thing\""]
["10:04,980","10:06,980","\"No, and then he'd like him to court\""]
["10:06,980","10:15,380","\"And then the hedgehog would have no way of paying for this protracted court case and the hedgehog's life would still be ruined\""]
["10:15,380","10:18,980","\"That's that's unfortunately more like how reality works true\""]
["10:18,980","10:23,840","\"It is true. You'll make 'em the cop and you're the guy and you just...\""]
["10:23,840","10:31,700","\"Come and get me, cop! *laughs* Get me, get me, get me, get me, get me. I'll do it again. See you later, low time.\""]
["10:31,700","10:41,100","\"Oh, it's mixed characters driving to a r*ck piece like a nut. He's announced like... like, he wrote a letter to the police station.\""]
["10:41,100","10:47,460","\"I'm driving to a r*ck, you can't stop me! Stop me! I can't stop myself!\""]
["10:47,460","10:49,460","\"This is horrible to control.\""]
["10:49,460","10:51,460","\"This is what hurts.\""]
["10:51,460","10:52,460","\"It's code 331.\""]
["10:52,460","10:53,460","\"Look at that!\""]
["10:53,460","10:55,460","\"What are you doing, Chris?\""]
["10:55,460","10:56,460","\"I'm gonna show you how it's done.\""]
["10:56,460","10:59,460","\"It's an unjoyed stick, better for something like this than a...\""]
["10:59,460","11:00,460","\"How do you do this?\""]
["11:00,460","11:01,460","\"Up, down, left, right.\""]
["11:01,460","11:02,460","\"Perfect.\""]
["11:02,460","11:04,460","\"And space is a handbrake, but it doesn't work so good.\""]
["11:04,460","11:05,460","\"No, it's gonna work perfect.\""]
["11:05,460","11:06,460","\"Watch this.\""]
["11:06,460","11:07,460","\"Handbrake?\""]
["11:07,460","11:08,460","\"Yeah!\""]
["11:08,460","11:11,460","\"I'm gonna take a short cut.\""]
["11:11,460","11:13,460","\"You found Nanny Doyle's lane.\""]
["11:13,460","11:15,460","\"How do I fucking restart?\""]
["11:15,460","11:20,220","\"Or for oh my gosh these controls are amazing. I'll click this all right. Thank you, sir\""]
["11:20,220","11:24,180","\"You're following this cursor. He will help all right. I'm fault. Well wait\""]
["11:24,180","11:28,580","\"Fuck you Chris you don't follow the suspect\""]
["11:28,580","11:33,900","\"It's really oh my god. See all right. I got him. I got him\""]
["11:33,900","11:38,340","\"This is one of those self-driving police cars\""]
["11:39,340","11:44,860","\"Let me try okay. What last yeah, let me know you guys okay. It's all you after this\""]
["11:44,860","11:48,260","\"This but I'm actually gonna succeed this time which I know it's surprising to check it out\""]
["11:48,260","11:52,740","\"See it's kind of fun challenging yourself to see how good you can get oh\""]

["12:51,180","12:54,620","\"There's no friction. Oh\""]
["12:54,620","13:01,100","\"Listen, I think it's because when you push the pedal to go forward you can't kind of half press it every time you press it\""]

["14:12,120","14:18,360","\"It's working okay on a straight away. Yeah, and then just be careful because you're gonna tap tap tap\""]
