["00:07,760","00:11,920","\"Actually, it's not, but it does have the best music in the game.\""]
["00:11,920","00:12,640","\"I think.\""]
["00:12,640","00:13,140","\"Wow.\""]

["00:13,600","00:15,040","\"Wow, it was a shifting sandland.\""]
["00:15,040","00:20,320","\"Yeah, exactly. It's the shifting sandland boss and the Mario Odyssey boss and the one and the one with the big schnaz.\""]
["00:20,320","00:22,560","\"Yeah, honestly, this is the most boring kind of boss.\""]
["00:22,560","00:24,720","\"Honestly, this is the most laziest boss I've ever seen Miyamoto.\""]
["00:24,720","00:26,080","\"This music is cool.\""]
["00:26,080","00:28,560","\"It sounds like columns for the Sega Genesis.\""]

["00:48,320","00:50,480","\"I really like robotics mean bean machine.\""]
["00:50,480","00:52,240","\"That has an awesome fucking soundtrack too.\""]
["00:52,240","00:56,880","\"Did you have to explode me into a million pieces?\""]
["00:56,880","00:58,560","\"You have to tick out Mr. Hands.\""]

["01:34,840","01:38,120","\"music is so fucking cool the way it comes in when it gets all scary it's fucking\""]
["01:38,120","01:42,000","\"red eyes are scary the way they use like color and like the rooms and change it\""]
["01:42,000","01:45,800","\"and stuff like that's the coolest part to me it's getting electrocuted oh fuck\""]
["01:45,800","01:50,440","\"I'm out how many fucking eyes does this guy have that you can take out what do I\""]
["01:50,440","01:52,960","\"Do now we're going to pop in his eye. Oh, he'll drop it\""]

["02:30,080","02:35,480","\"Yeah, I think they are dropping you're right look there for near you, but they like break. Oh\""]
["02:35,480","02:41,400","\"That's like later games made that I always thought that was a good mechanic where when an arrow drops you can pick it up again\""]
["02:42,680","02:48,740","\"It makes fucking sense if you if you shot an arrow it doesn't dissipate into the ether you can fucking pick it up again\""]

["06:57,340","06:59,340","\"Yeah, I hated using the stylus\""]
["06:59,340","07:02,900","\"Minish cab using the style was cool. The thing is you can do it right\""]
["07:02,900","07:08,140","\"Just like you can use the Wii remote and nunchuck to fucking do it right like they did with the Mario Galaxy\""]
["07:08,140","07:11,700","\"I don't like how DS games rely on the stylus back in the day\""]
["07:11,700","07:16,900","\"They learn from their miss they learn to the 3ds that you can just make a fucking game with like gimmicks that people can\""]
["07:16,900","07:22,420","\"Optionally use but I hated it this world is so fucking cool. It is cool. It is awesome\""]
["07:22,420","07:28,060","\"I want to tell you my favorite thing about it, but only when I get to it. Okay. I love when the place gets colored again\""]
["07:28,060","07:33,180","\"Trust in my words. What awaits you in stuff? Oh, we're driving froze. Um\""]
["07:33,180","07:35,820","\"He was already dead\""]

["07:48,100","07:50,980","\"Yeah, this was magical when I first saw it as a kid\""]
["07:51,540","07:53,540","\"Just listen\""]

["08:30,420","08:35,700","\"And they had to change like this one part just to be gray so they can change do the color effect whenever it goes back through\""]
["08:35,700","08:37,780","\"Which is a really cool concept\""]
["08:37,780","08:42,820","\"Hey, what's up? Can you tell me what it's like in there? I've been in there in quite a while. Why don't I hang out?\""]

["08:57,540","09:01,140","\"Do you know where to search and what you must do to open the hidden way?\""]
["09:01,140","09:05,220","\"You will find a clue in the shape of the herald near where we arrived at the castle\""]
["09:05,220","09:07,860","\"So you just push them to make a triforce\""]
