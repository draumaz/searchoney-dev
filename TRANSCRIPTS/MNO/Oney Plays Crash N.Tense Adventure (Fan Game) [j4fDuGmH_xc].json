["00:31,120","00:36,620","\"Was ever actually was there a crash game ever like this before from the side? Oh, there was Game Boy Advance games\""]
["00:36,620","00:43,640","\"They did not look this nice actually yeah, I really like the sprites on this it feels fucking spot on\""]
["00:43,640","00:49,160","\"Was this maybe like a dude like it was it was this a studio? Oh, it was me\""]
["00:49,160","00:54,620","\"It's a fan game. So it was made by like three guys one guy did the coding one guy did the F at the graphics\""]
["00:54,620","01:00,340","\"Pile drive the one guy did the news in the game. I've never played craft fandiku before who ass\""]
["01:00,340","01:04,700","\"You know, this is really cool. It's a point of what all the gamers out there\""]
["01:04,700","01:12,100","\"But grandicooters Chris O'Neill's favorite game. He said he'd kill for it. I fucking died already\""]
["01:12,100","01:16,100","\"I would kill for a game like this, but it's a poo instead of crash bandicoot a poo\""]
["01:16,100","01:19,180","\"Now that he's been banished out of the Simpsons\""]
["01:21,180","01:24,740","\"done? I don't know. Okay, good. They bad.\""]
["01:24,740","01:27,580","\"But they should fucking bad about either evil characters.\""]
["01:27,580","01:32,960","\"Do they? This is a legitimate question because I haven't seen the Simpsons like 20 fucking\""]
["01:32,960","01:34,300","\"years. Do they still.\""]
["01:34,300","01:37,480","\"Get that apple. Is that an apple? Is that a reddish?\""]

["01:54,500","02:00,040","\"Talking to three people here that have never watched this like the Simpsons postseason like 10. Yeah\""]
["02:00,040","02:08,060","\"Pass that shit, but I will say I will say actually the recent season they got I think they're with a new studio now\""]
["02:08,060","02:12,900","\"Because the actual story. Yeah the storyboard you like the poses are actually pretty well-animated sometimes\""]
["02:12,900","02:16,220","\"Like they're really experimenting. It's it's you know\""]
["02:16,220","02:22,200","\"They're whipping the Chinese little harder this month. I'm sure they have an ungodly amount of money to pay the whippers now\""]
["02:22,200","02:29,180","\"That was that was kind of bullshit, but okay, okay, so you got to fix that one there. Oh, it's bullshit\""]
["02:29,180","02:33,340","\"Ooh, no, my god\""]
["02:33,340","02:37,420","\"Do you think that crash goes to the Christian heaven when he dies? Oh?\""]
["02:37,420","02:39,740","\"Yeah, he has wings and shit away\""]
["02:39,740","02:43,820","\"And he sings\""]
["02:43,820","02:45,820","\"I know you are here.\""]
["02:45,820","02:48,820","\"Yahweh, my way, your way, I way.\""]

["02:58,820","03:03,820","\"Then he pinches his nose and yanks on it a few times and green goo comes out.\""]
["03:03,820","03:07,820","\"You know, as far as I know, this game has original music.\""]
["03:07,820","03:08,820","\"Really?\""]
["03:08,820","03:09,820","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:09,820","03:11,820","\"This sounds- I just figured they took it from the game.\""]
["03:11,820","03:16,160","\"I think they use the sound font, but yeah, I think this is all that's own thing\""]
["03:16,160","03:23,580","\"Wow check out fucking the doctor effort team of doing stuff right is those who do you think you are?\""]
["03:23,580","03:27,360","\"No, yeah, the guy who did the animation is really good\""]
["03:27,360","03:29,860","\"Yeah, what's it? Oh?\""]
["03:29,860","03:31,860","\"I think it's like\""]
["03:31,860","03:39,260","\"The guy drew him on us on a oni doodles his fans by coincidence\""]
["03:40,300","03:44,460","\"That how you found out about this ah no actually ding dong showed it to me\""]
["03:44,460","03:49,420","\"And then I like lee no download it and played it for a little second and then I saw that he did it and I was like wow\""]
["03:49,420","03:52,220","\"Wow\""]
["03:52,220","03:53,220","\"oh\""]
["03:53,220","03:58,180","\"Wow, I broke two at once um that's not true to the original so delete it yeah\""]
["03:58,180","04:00,420","\"Shut it all down\""]
["04:00,420","04:05,620","\"Hey, uh, Zach. Yeah, tell me what what is your childhood platformer?\""]
["04:05,620","04:08,620","\"I asked my Scott did you play sonic to say?\""]
["04:08,620","04:10,620","\"I\""]
["04:10,620","04:15,640","\"Played Sonic Adventure. I'd say if I had to be a platform under the fucking Donkey Kong 64 like Mario\""]
["04:15,640","04:18,980","\"I had a PS1, but I think I only had Spyro. Oh\""]
["04:18,980","04:23,980","\"And it's Crock. I don't know if I had any of the games. I think GTA or something\""]
["04:23,980","04:29,140","\"But I think I played that you know, there's great turmoil in the Spyro community right now is there because yeah\""]
["04:29,140","04:33,940","\"And in the remake they're changing a lot of the the enemy designs and they all look really stupid\""]
["04:34,540","04:37,920","\"So the graphics all look really nice, but it's really ugly\""]
["04:37,920","04:40,280","\"I saw some of the some of this new stuff for that\""]
["04:40,280","04:46,040","\"I was like you're kind of losing the point a little bit when you see some of the redesign choices. Yeah, let's like it's clean\""]
["04:46,040","04:50,960","\"I don't know. It's really hard to clean up anything like that. Yeah, I think it looks fine\""]
["04:50,960","04:53,920","\"But I never played the original ones. I was looking at something\""]
["04:53,920","04:56,960","\"Somebody remade I could have time it like\""]
["04:56,960","05:00,520","\"Yeah, I remember that those are always shitty\""]
["05:02,640","05:04,640","\"This fucking lens flare\""]
["05:04,640","05:10,560","\"Say is whatever you see somebody try to be really could get like that like any like really really like old game 3d old game\""]
["05:10,560","05:12,640","\"It just doesn't look right. It looks creepy\""]
["05:12,640","05:19,760","\"Well, I mean it's always supposed like I think that's the generation that you should remake because it's probably the one that's aged the worst\""]
["05:19,760","05:25,440","\"Yeah, like super Nintendo sprites and shit still look good like Street Fighter 2 still looks fucking fine\""]
["05:26,960","05:32,320","\"But yeah, like anybody that tells you that golden I still totally holds up visually\""]
["05:32,320","05:35,440","\"Their own\""]
["05:35,440","05:41,500","\"Really good example. Oh, I can't heavily remastered if that was like a like a at 64 PS one game. Oh\""]
["05:41,500","05:44,040","\"That looked really good\""]
["05:44,040","05:48,680","\"Yeah, you know what even though it looks all polygon and we're still stylized really nicely\""]
["05:48,680","05:53,120","\"No, I'm saying the remastered version that was as like done really well\""]
["05:53,600","05:58,440","\"The the insane trails you look pretty good for what it was crash himself looked kind of gross\""]
["05:58,440","06:01,840","\"Actually a lot of the designs look kind of weird\""]
["06:01,840","06:05,160","\"That's what I was that's what I'm trying to give about the best example of that big don't really well\""]
["06:05,160","06:07,160","\"They actually they typically don't\""]
["06:07,160","06:13,880","\"remake games from that generation because it's that it's that strange middle ground of like it's 3d\""]
["06:13,880","06:20,320","\"So it's got like an engine and everything and they have to like rebuild it for modern technology\""]
["06:20,320","06:24,000","\"It's not just a matter polishing up the graphics and stuff like well\""]
["06:24,000","06:29,760","\"Just the fact that they have to build a whole new game from the ground up kind of makes it a lot of work\""]
["06:29,760","06:35,360","\"Which is why they don't do it a lot. There's a really good job of capturing old aesthetics in Mexican with new graphics\""]
["06:35,360","06:39,720","\"They've always did a really good job with that both with the designs in the stages of the yeah\""]
["06:39,720","06:42,880","\"What is what it what?\""]
["06:42,880","06:47,700","\"Try to get winners three symbols. So is that be one is a diamond\""]
["06:48,960","06:55,360","\"And the third is an onk what I'm saying do you is I would say is you must get all three just some of the great and powerful\""]
["06:55,360","06:59,840","\"Foth so you can break his stupid little IBIS be can shove it down his eye\""]
["06:59,840","07:04,320","\"Graspatic good is that you have to collect crystals within each stage to pass it fully\""]
["07:04,320","07:07,760","\"But you only need one but if you want you can get optional ones to complete it 100%\""]
["07:07,760","07:10,360","\"Yeah, and then once you get all the crystals he goes whoa\""]
["07:10,360","07:13,520","\"Yeah\""]
["07:13,520","07:17,640","\"But the the pink one is right the pink one is the most important one\""]
["07:18,160","07:24,380","\"Wow fading technology you see that what the hell look I love that that looks so good. Yeah, I like that a lot of kiss\""]
["07:24,380","07:29,560","\"Yeah, you know what can you do that again put me put a jp to be kissin him\""]
["07:29,560","07:38,880","\"Michael Q sec\""]
["07:38,880","07:46,040","\"That's why that's a big that a big so that little character on the YouTube channel the little character or the little man\""]
["07:46,040","07:48,040","\"Hello\""]
["07:48,040","07:49,960","\"He rebought back the penguins\""]
["07:49,960","07:55,720","\"Lyle do you know penguins have been extinct for 14 years nobody has told anyone nobody noticed\""]
["07:55,720","07:58,920","\"Lyle tell the story about how you buried a kid in Minecraft\""]
["07:58,920","08:05,000","\"Whoa, that Minecraft blocks and then harassed what a forum you were told story is that real?\""]
["08:05,000","08:08,060","\"That not exactly that but yeah, that is\""]
["08:08,060","08:15,640","\"80% about it. Yeah, yeah, basically so basically this is old-school old-school\""]
["08:15,640","08:20,140","\"school Minecraft like before it had a proper online service like really early\""]
["08:20,140","08:26,080","\"like to get into a server you had to go on a forum and get the IP of the server\""]
["08:26,080","08:31,800","\"and manually enter it so me and some asshole friends of mine fucking went\""]
["08:31,800","08:37,840","\"on to this forum and we found something described as a Christian light RP so\""]
["08:37,840","08:42,640","\"a server so basically so you literally did that whole this is a Christian or\""]
["08:42,640","08:43,480","\"- Or a pay server.\""]
["08:43,480","08:45,720","\"- Basically, I don't know how they found it.\""]
["08:45,720","08:47,240","\"I wasn't the one that found it,\""]
["08:47,240","08:50,400","\"but basically what happened was\""]
["08:50,400","08:54,280","\"we fucked up the whole entire thing.\""]
["08:54,280","08:55,280","\"- Oh, wow.\""]
["08:55,280","08:56,280","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:56,280","08:57,120","\"- Oh, yeah.\""]
["08:57,120","08:58,280","\"- I know the story, I'd actually subscribe.\""]
["08:58,280","08:59,120","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:59,120","08:59,960","\"- I don't know if you do tell it,\""]
["08:59,960","09:03,600","\"I feel sick to my stomach about the evil that you've done.\""]
["09:03,600","09:04,600","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:04,600","09:05,440","\"- Go ahead.\""]
["09:05,440","09:07,600","\"- So basically we just fucked up the whole thing\""]
["09:07,600","09:12,400","\"and there was one dude that saw everything happen.\""]
["09:12,400","09:16,280","\"Like we fucked with the whole entire thing after the mods left.\""]
["09:16,280","09:22,400","\"And there was one guy that was running around watching all of it and freaking out going like,\""]
["09:22,400","09:25,280","\"\"\"I'm gonna tell the mods! I'm gonna get you!\"\"\""]
["09:25,280","09:33,800","\"And so I went on the forum, I went on the thread about the server, and I blamed it on him.\""]
["09:33,800","09:40,800","\"And also my character was like the Monopoly man, so I spoke in like old Atlantic English.\""]
["09:40,800","09:45,360","\"I was like, \"\"I do say my good friends! This individual is not to be trusted!\"\"\""]
["09:45,360","09:52,800","\"And so, I don't think anyone bought it, but the key thing about it was the dude thought that people were buying it.\""]
["09:52,800","09:57,300","\"So the fact that I was blaming it on him, he was fucking like freaking out about it.\""]
["09:57,300","10:02,700","\"They were like making these long like, refutation posts of the things that I was saying.\""]
["10:02,700","10:06,700","\"Like, \"\"Uh, thirdly, if you look here, you can see evidence such that...\"\"\""]
["10:06,700","10:08,860","\"And I was like, \"\"I've been framed, I swear.\"\"\""]
["10:08,860","10:11,140","\"For some-- somehow I get them to buy this,\""]
["10:11,140","10:12,780","\"and I go back into the server,\""]
["10:12,780","10:15,660","\"and like, I get whitelisted to go back in.\""]
["10:15,660","10:17,140","\"Uh, and then old Minecraft,\""]
["10:17,140","10:18,500","\"I don't know if it still does this.\""]
["10:18,500","10:20,340","\"If you run into the distance, it'll--\""]
["10:20,340","10:21,900","\"[sniffs]\""]
["10:21,900","10:23,460","\"It'll like, expand the map,\""]
["10:23,460","10:26,700","\"and it'll fucking slow everything down for everybody.\""]
["10:26,700","10:28,940","\"So, because there were actual mods there,\""]
["10:28,940","10:31,460","\"I just snuck off and started doing that,\""]
["10:31,460","10:34,060","\"and then, uh, they realized what I was doing,\""]
["10:34,060","10:36,020","\"and since the mod didn't know how to use\""]
["10:36,020","10:39,660","\"his fucking modding tools, he couldn't ban me.\""]
["10:39,660","10:41,660","\"And he was like, \"\"This guy's hacking!\""]
["10:41,660","10:44,900","\"He's a, I've never seen anything like this.\"\"\""]
["10:44,900","10:49,340","\"So what he could do was he could fucking teleport me back\""]
["10:49,340","10:52,060","\"to where you spawn.\""]
["10:52,060","10:55,420","\"So he kept doing that and he built a box of,\""]
["10:55,420","10:56,900","\"I forget what it's called in Minecraft,\""]
["10:56,900","10:58,100","\"the shit that you can't break.\""]
["10:58,100","11:00,140","\"Yeah, when you dig all the way down, you can't break it.\""]
["11:00,140","11:01,780","\"He built a box of that.\""]
["11:01,780","11:05,660","\"And then he tried teleporting me to the box,\""]
["11:05,660","11:07,660","\"but since he was fucking inside of it,\""]
["11:07,660","11:10,180","\"it kept putting me on top of the box.\""]
["11:10,180","11:13,260","\"And they were like, whoa, he must be speed hacking through.\""]
["11:13,260","11:16,180","\"It was like, I was getting like accused of doing\""]
["11:16,180","11:18,540","\"like this fucking high level hacking,\""]
["11:18,540","11:20,780","\"the likes of which they'd never seen before\""]
["11:20,780","11:22,540","\"because this fucking guy didn't understand\""]
["11:22,540","11:25,420","\"how the game he was moderating worked.\""]
["11:25,420","11:30,420","\"And then yeah, like, I had a spy do some reconnaissance\""]
["11:30,420","11:34,700","\"and there was like a whole entire section\""]
["11:34,700","11:38,460","\"of like the facts, like they had like rules of the server\""]
["11:38,460","11:42,020","\"and signs on the, as soon as he entered.\""]
["11:42,020","11:44,380","\"And there was like a whole sign dedicated to like,\""]
["11:44,380","11:47,220","\"if you see the hacker known as Squeeble.\""]
["11:47,220","11:50,660","\"Never like fucking it was, yeah, it was a bull shark.\""]
["11:50,660","11:51,980","\"Yeah, it was.\""]
["11:51,980","11:54,100","\"That's the only time I've had fun on Minecraft,\""]
["11:54,100","11:55,500","\"the rest of it I fucking hate it.\""]
["11:55,500","11:59,220","\"- It's not the way we've had fun harassing somebody to tears.\""]
["11:59,220","12:02,220","\"- Bring a child, the menace, the societal menace,\""]
["12:02,220","12:04,220","\"not a Squeeble is probably child to tears.\""]
["12:04,220","12:10,680","\"Old school internet was uh that was the real shit. That was the hard shit people didn't treat like it was their fucking living room\""]
["12:10,680","12:12,040","\"Like they do now\""]

["24:39,020","24:50,660","\"I saw possibly like the worst fucking like deviant-art ass image I've ever seen the other day\""]
["24:50,660","24:52,580","\"That's quite a state but I have to say it's quite\""]
["24:52,580","25:04,580","\"It was fucking Sandy from Spongebob Squarepants and she was giant and she had a huge penis with like a swollen urethra\""]
["25:04,580","25:08,340","\"- And she was vacuuming cars up into her penis.\""]
["25:08,340","25:09,840","\"(laughing)\""]
["25:09,840","25:11,320","\"- With what, her penis?\""]
["25:11,320","25:13,500","\"- Yeah, her penis was like a big like,\""]
["25:13,500","25:15,800","\"\"\"You know, Kirby sucks up bad guys.\"\"\""]
["25:15,800","25:17,260","\"It was like doing that.\""]
["25:17,260","25:19,040","\"It was the fucking worst.\""]
["25:19,040","25:20,880","\"- But it was sucking up his cars in so bad guys.\""]
["25:20,880","25:21,880","\"- Yeah, because she was giant,\""]
["25:21,880","25:22,780","\"she was just sucking up,\""]
["25:22,780","25:24,200","\"she was in like a parking lot,\""]
["25:24,200","25:25,720","\"eating cars with her dick.\""]
["25:25,720","25:27,200","\"(laughing)\""]

["25:35,240","25:39,120","\"At least be clear to at least have her sucky a fish people from the show.\""]
["25:39,120","25:43,840","\"No, I think the implication is this is Sandy in the real world.\""]
["25:43,840","25:45,960","\"So she's not in a little costume.\""]
["25:45,960","25:48,080","\"No, no, she's completely new.\""]
["25:48,080","25:50,240","\"Okay, listen to this. Are you listening to this?\""]

["25:51,440","25:52,320","\"Listen to this.\""]
["25:52,320","25:54,040","\"Bullshit.\""]
["25:54,040","25:55,880","\"That sound effect sucks. Get rid of that.\""]
["25:55,880","25:56,360","\"Is it really?\""]
["25:56,360","25:57,480","\"Put in the old version.\""]
["26:00,000","26:05,840","\"Damn this game is fucking awesome, dude. I'm sorry. I'm just gushing cuz I love this shit. Yeah, no, it's it's fine\""]
["26:05,840","26:09,420","\"It's probably the last time I I spent thinking about this the better\""]
["26:09,420","26:14,800","\"I'm just I can't escape it if these guys were given a little budget. They can make an actual better experience\""]
["26:14,800","26:19,080","\"Hey guys, that's what happened with a sonic man. Yeah, I really actually I swear to god\""]
["26:19,080","26:24,600","\"I hope these guys get some kind of chance what's like media. Yeah, they were fans making fan games and then the Sega were like\""]

["26:42,320","26:48,920","\"The no, this is honestly amazing like if you played the Game Boy Advance games\""]
["26:48,920","26:52,760","\"They used to put out they're fucking so gross and ugly and like that they play good\""]
["26:52,760","26:55,240","\"But they're so ugly to look at and this is such a cool little style\""]
["26:56,040","27:01,800","\"This artist guy like this or yeah, no, they played pretty much exactly the same we should actually play them\""]
["27:01,800","27:06,600","\"Just reminds me of Donkey Kong country. I know it's not that but that little Michael. Oh look well\""]
["27:06,600","27:10,360","\"There you go. There you go. Yeah, I like mine cards\""]

["27:47,760","27:49,760","\"You know they're going to.\""]
["27:49,760","27:50,760","\"Whee-yo.\""]
["27:50,760","27:58,560","\"I noticed an episode one of the Crash Band Good Fade game, but 17 minutes and five seconds.\""]
["27:58,560","28:01,440","\"You do realize why they put mine cart sections in the games, right?\""]
["28:01,440","28:03,120","\"It's for a little variety.\""]
["28:03,120","28:04,120","\"Oh.\""]
["28:04,120","28:07,760","\"I thought it was because they wanted to encourage the coal industry.\""]
["28:07,760","28:11,880","\"You can use those big coals in print on video game culture.\""]
["28:11,880","28:12,880","\"Yeah.\""]
["28:12,880","28:13,880","\"Abzak, it's stay tuned.\""]

["28:15,360","28:17,280","\"I think that's it. I don't know how to get in here.\""]
["28:17,280","28:19,120","\"Well, it's closed due to difficulty.\""]
["28:19,120","28:20,120","\"Man.\""]

["28:35,440","28:36,960","\"I got it.\""]
["28:36,960","28:39,360","\"That stage is called a loan in the cart.\""]
