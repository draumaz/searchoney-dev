["01:26,720","01:29,240","\"It's a climber. It's because they didn't want to animate their feet\""]
["01:29,240","01:35,020","\"That's the only reason remember when we went to the arcade and it's full of all the slimer stuff animals and just look like green turds\""]

["04:52,920","04:54,920","\"That was yummy.\""]
["04:54,920","04:57,920","\"It's because the lights got turned out.\""]
["04:57,920","04:59,920","\"It's because, yeah, it's because it's night time.\""]
["04:59,920","05:06,760","\"It's like girl. It's all peaceful bonk bonk. It makes me want to lay down and cuddle up with good book this guy\""]

["05:29,760","05:34,840","\"Don't grab me. Don't grab me. How's he know martial arts? He's good. He's a good man\""]
["05:34,840","05:37,860","\"No, he's dead\""]
["05:37,860","05:42,320","\"We gave me a crystal helper\""]
["05:42,320","05:50,600","\"You know Julian crystal weapons break permanently and you can't use him no more. No, that's thanks. Yep\""]

["05:53,280","05:57,000","\"You can break a diamond for fun\""]
["05:57,000","05:59,000","\"I\""]
["05:59,000","06:05,820","\"Wish this was just like an exploration game you wish it was yeah, cuz I really like how these areas look and I wish there is just like\""]
["06:05,820","06:11,800","\"I mean, you know, it's that's not to say that I wish that this game turned into something different\""]
["06:11,800","06:17,840","\"I just mean I wish there was a game with this level of detail and constructing a world where the only thing you have to do is\""]
["06:17,840","06:19,720","\"Walk around just just look at it\""]
["06:19,720","06:23,760","\"Yeah, because the combat is not something I'd probably be interested in if I was playing this\""]
["06:23,760","06:28,760","\"I'd probably just want to look at shit. Well, you know Julian's probably the most favored thing about this game. Oh\""]
["06:28,760","06:33,560","\"It's a little Pidgey doing what's a game with combat that you actually enjoy?\""]
["06:33,560","06:38,240","\"It's a good question. What's it?\""]
["06:38,240","06:43,080","\"Does Luigi's can't mansion count as combat\""]
["06:43,080","06:49,400","\"Because I feel like Luigi's mansion has the most\""]
["06:51,280","06:53,280","\"Satisfying set of controls that I've ever\""]
["06:53,280","06:58,680","\"Ever played and I really like that you have to use the little control stairs. Oh\""]

["07:10,240","07:14,880","\"You must be having an off day because I remember you being able to kill those guys pretty easily record damn it\""]
["07:14,880","07:17,240","\"I'm gonna try this one more time\""]
["07:17,240","07:19,920","\"But if I die again, I'm just gonna turn it off\""]
["07:19,920","07:23,280","\"Did you hear that?\""]
["07:23,280","07:24,280","\"What was that?\""]
