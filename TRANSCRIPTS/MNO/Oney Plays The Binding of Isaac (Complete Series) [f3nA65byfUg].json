["07:26,000","07:28,080","\"- If that was real there'd be videos of it.\""]
["07:28,080","07:30,460","\"- You know, I've heard that if you have a big, big tapeworm\""]
["07:30,460","07:31,680","\"you put sugar on the end of your tongue\""]
["07:31,680","07:34,000","\"and sit there with your mouth open for a bit.\""]
["07:34,000","07:35,360","\"It will crawl up through your body\""]
["07:35,360","07:36,360","\"and try to eat the sugar.\""]
["07:36,360","07:37,640","\"- See, we've all heard different versions\""]

["07:38,800","07:40,800","\"I don't think it's real.\""]
["07:40,800","07:43,640","\"- That can't be real 'cause there would be videos of it.\""]
["07:43,640","07:46,960","\"- I was gonna say, also the tape worm definitely\""]
["07:46,960","07:48,520","\"is designed to live in your intestines.\""]
["07:48,520","07:52,320","\"I don't think it ever crawls up through your throat.\""]
["07:52,320","07:55,320","\"- It's a really cool myth, but I don't think it's real.\""]
["07:55,320","07:56,640","\"- We should try it.\""]
["07:56,640","07:59,640","\"- There's weirder shit, honestly, that are real in nature.\""]
["07:59,640","08:02,840","\"Like those little zombie slugs with the ants,\""]
["08:02,840","08:06,440","\"little funguses that the Last of Us is based on,\""]
["08:06,440","08:08,080","\"and that's real.\""]
["08:08,080","08:12,640","\"No, it is that's real. There's little power sights to stick get into slugs eyeballs\""]

["08:37,600","08:44,380","\"No actually, isn't that forever isn't that sad face? I don't think so\""]
["08:44,380","08:52,200","\"He looks kind like oh he is crying. Yeah, there's little tears. We should kill him. He's in his misery\""]
["08:52,200","08:54,960","\"No, I like those little MS paint flies\""]
["08:54,960","09:04,080","\"So there's two secret rooms in every level and\""]
["09:05,040","09:07,640","\"You can kind of tell where they are like I didn't have a key\""]
["09:07,640","09:11,320","\"So I couldn't get the item for this, but I really wanted a key\""]
["09:11,320","09:14,600","\"So I had to I had to finagle my way into this room. It's cool\""]
["09:14,600","09:20,040","\"And now I can go get the item. Have you ever played Zalda Link's Awakening or the of course\""]

["09:24,920","09:29,320","\"But yeah, if you run up and down fast enough you you could grab an item and run out without him catching you\""]
["09:29,320","09:34,280","\"Really? And if you come back in he kills you. It's like the class thing with a command man\""]
["09:34,280","09:39,860","\"What yeah, oh my god. No, I have not I don't remember that it means you can never go back to the shop\""]

["11:03,720","11:09,720","\"No, why does it not get old because as you combine items you get like totally different builds\""]
["11:09,720","11:16,120","\"And so I mean look for anybody you can get sick of a game sure but it has but you've never gotten\""]
["11:16,120","11:21,560","\"I haven't it has so much replayability just because it changes so much every single time like even right now\""]
["11:21,560","11:23,840","\"this build is oh\""]
["11:23,840","11:29,720","\"Fuck yeah one heart one heart one heart death. Whoa what happened your head? I have a I have a\""]
["11:29,720","11:36,440","\"Gypsy a gypsy thing on my face watch out. Yeah, they're a little bastards\""]
["11:36,440","11:43,360","\"Yeah, one heart one heart death. I need to get some fucking help. Oh, there we go. This is gonna help\""]
["11:43,360","11:44,640","\"This is good. This is cool\""]
["11:44,640","11:46,940","\"These guys suck because they can fucking chuck shit\""]
["11:46,940","11:51,240","\"So how many like variables you think are in the game that make it so different every time?\""]
["11:52,080","11:58,800","\"Well beyond just like the randomized levels between the items themselves. There's like hundreds and hundreds of items\""]
["11:58,800","12:01,140","\"hundreds\""]
["12:01,140","12:03,140","\"Should I get poo water? Yeah?\""]
["12:03,140","12:05,020","\"Okay\""]
["12:05,020","12:06,840","\"shared shots\""]
["12:06,840","12:12,500","\"Yes, and so do any of the items have negative drawbacks so yeah kind of\""]
["12:12,500","12:17,700","\"There's one item in particular called the crystal skull, which I don't even know why it's in this game\""]
["12:17,700","12:21,400","\"Oh wait this character can fly over holes. Yeah, that's why I start with this character\""]
["12:21,400","12:23,320","\"So we can kind of just like bypass some shit.\""]
["12:23,320","12:25,440","\"This makes the game a lot easier 'cause spikes,\""]
["12:25,440","12:26,680","\"like I can't get hit by spikes on it.\""]
["12:26,680","12:27,520","\"- Oh!\""]
["12:27,520","12:31,400","\"- But the crystal skull, when you get hit once,\""]
["12:31,400","12:34,560","\"you fucking start, like it'll make you start over\""]
["12:34,560","12:35,960","\"from the outside of the room,\""]
["12:35,960","12:39,640","\"which means any progress you had is gone.\""]
["12:39,640","12:40,920","\"So that can suck.\""]
["12:40,920","12:42,040","\"And then there's something called, I think,\""]
["12:42,040","12:47,040","\"soy milk where it gives you like little tiny little bead tears.\""]
["12:47,040","12:50,800","\"They're really fast, but they're like totally useless.\""]

["13:32,400","13:34,240","\"- The troll ball.\""]

["13:46,240","13:48,760","\"- I like the, I remember that this game used to look\""]
["13:48,760","13:53,920","\"a lot more flashy and like yeah it was like smoother yeah how it's pixel art\""]
["13:53,920","14:00,840","\"mm-hmm wow yeah um I actually prefer this if you had one by the eyes of the flash\""]
["14:00,840","14:06,260","\"game right was it yeah there was a flash version on new grounds I used to love\""]

["14:42,180","14:46,780","\"I just I prefer Isaac a lot and then there was that new game that they were doing like this card thing\""]
["14:46,780","14:53,680","\"Hmm, and maybe I'm just not giving it a chance because I got starry eyes for Isaac, but it just doesn't look it doesn't entice my\""]
["14:53,680","15:00,020","\"Doesn't make my gonads tingle. I will say I like I\""]
["15:00,020","15:07,620","\"Like games with consequence. Yeah, and I felt like meat boy didn't have any oh just because you restart like constantly\""]
["15:07,620","15:11,900","\"Yeah, this has the ultimate consequence. Yeah, I like that you build this character\""]
["15:11,900","15:16,960","\"You you you fucking rock and roll and you could be playing for hours and then get one item\""]
["15:16,960","15:21,540","\"If you don't know the items get one item out of the hundreds that fucks your build and\""]
["15:21,540","15:26,780","\"You're just done. I just like all all that out all those hours all that effort\""]
["15:26,780","15:31,840","\"I like for not mischievous and pushing how far I can do something and then if I die\""]
["15:31,840","15:34,760","\"I know I fucked up and it's my fault. What I was your fault\""]
["15:34,760","15:39,440","\"I don't I don't like you remember Feds. Yeah, like there was like no consequence in that either\""]
["15:39,440","15:47,360","\"and it like that's why I never liked it really but I do like end game in this in this yeah yeah\""]
["15:47,360","15:52,640","\"yeah there's like when you get to that skull level is that technically the end of your run uh\""]
["15:52,640","16:00,240","\"or kind uh sometimes you can go beyond far beyond the yeah but yeah there are endings there's\""]
["16:00,240","16:07,840","\"multiple endings um depending on how far how many things you've unlocked and stuff this is this is\""]
["16:07,840","16:14,040","\"not an OP run by the way this is but there are ways to actually kind of break this game\""]
["16:14,040","16:18,800","\"if you get the right combo of things especially in greed mode you can you can break this game\""]
["16:18,800","16:24,560","\"so hard we had entire screen just full of every item in the game really oh yeah and we\""]
["16:24,560","16:29,080","\"got so many of them it started really it like basically it doesn't recycle the items they\""]
["16:29,080","16:35,520","\"all default to breakfast which is a health thing you can get is I'll get that yay or nay\""]
["16:35,520","16:37,240","\"Yeah. All right. Looks like a dummy book.\""]

["17:04,200","17:06,200","\"Remember that Billy Hatcher in the\""]
["17:06,200","17:16,460","\"Hey Tomar, yeah, why don't you make a fan-made sonic game but make it about you make it better\""]
["17:16,460","17:19,840","\"Yeah, just you running is just for the sake of the tome\""]
["17:19,840","17:29,880","\"That game freedom planet I haven't really played it yet, but oh yeah, I see yeah\""]
["17:29,880","17:34,880","\"- I know that's like a big Sonic type fan game.\""]
["17:34,880","17:37,720","\"I guess see, I don't know if, is it fair to call a fan game?\""]
["17:37,720","17:40,160","\"- Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.\""]
["17:40,160","17:41,640","\"- We got money. - We got money.\""]

["17:43,360","17:45,960","\"'cause I'm just interested in what happens.\""]
["17:45,960","17:47,240","\"- That's fair.\""]
["17:47,240","17:49,800","\"- There will be a point though, like if we get a Satan room\""]
["17:49,800","17:51,680","\"where like we just physically can't even get all,\""]
["17:51,680","17:53,360","\"well actually with eight lives, we could get everything.\""]
["17:53,360","17:55,080","\"- What is a Satan room?\""]

["18:03,240","18:04,800","\"I think we'll see another one, we'll see.\""]
["18:04,800","18:07,320","\"Those are randomized, and there's also angel rooms,\""]
["18:07,320","18:08,800","\"but because we grabbed a Satan item,\""]
["18:08,800","18:10,640","\"I think angel rooms are out of the question.\""]
["18:10,640","18:11,640","\"They stopped spawning.\""]

["18:17,640","18:19,760","\"a fan made version, really.\""]
["18:19,760","18:21,840","\"I think it's called Antibirth,\""]
["18:21,840","18:26,840","\"and it's published, I think it's published like officially,\""]
["18:27,680","18:31,280","\"but it wasn't made by them, it was made by a bunch of different people.\""]
["18:31,280","18:35,520","\"But they have the soundtrack for it as fucking phenomenal.\""]

["01:32:34,500","01:32:39,780","\"But we'll see we'll see we'll see making a procedural game is one of the fucking hardest things you can do one\""]
["01:32:39,780","01:32:46,040","\"That's a super fun. Yeah, I was gonna say making it funds hard like this plenty of like really bland procedural game\""]

["01:32:48,900","01:32:53,960","\"So like you're gonna lose a lot of fun, but well, I guess when they're concerned rules that they have you know\""]
["01:32:53,960","01:32:58,700","\"Yeah, I was gonna say like a lot of people choose procedural because it's technically less work than\""]
["01:32:58,700","01:33:04,420","\"Well, fuck you can be less work than hand designing everything if you want a really big game. Yeah\""]
["01:33:04,420","01:33:13,500","\"I do see you still like it's not truly random. So you still are basically designing everything just\""]
["01:33:14,340","01:33:19,020","\"Designing it in a way that's like modular. Oh, I'm saying is it's cool. I like it\""]
["01:33:19,020","01:33:25,260","\"Maybe I get a lot of day. I'll make a game as cool as this\""]

["01:33:45,840","01:33:54,340","\"Yeah, you have to go to the bank and ask for the premium only only only five dollar coins just got your face on it\""]

["01:34:24,200","01:34:30,400","\"You can go slow, but you I'm gonna have a lot of things that you can do to make make your own challenges\""]
["01:34:30,400","01:34:35,620","\"You should do it like that movie speed where if you go slow, you're like a shark. You have to keep moving otherwise you die\""]
["01:34:35,620","01:34:39,440","\"It's honestly I'm trying to make it so like anyone can play it\""]
["01:34:39,440","01:34:43,920","\"but it's gonna have a high skill ceiling and it's pretty much four speedrunners as well.\""]
["01:34:43,920","01:34:50,720","\"That's gonna be fun. I don't want to give away anything about it. We're gonna have a trailer hopefully in March and then you'll find out.\""]
