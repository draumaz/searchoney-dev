["00:35,240","00:37,240","\"I can't fucking wait.\""]
["00:37,240","00:39,240","\"Okay.\""]
["00:39,240","00:42,120","\"Most powerful single attack is the\""]
["00:42,120","00:44,680","\"is the world destroyer.\""]
["00:44,680","00:46,600","\"Don't use it.\""]
["00:46,600","00:47,960","\"The game offer.\""]
["00:47,960","00:51,000","\"If you click both joysticks, the world ends.\""]
["00:51,000","00:52,360","\"Please don't do it.\""]
["00:52,360","00:57,880","\"I can appreciate that the lollipops they have on screen,\""]
["00:57,880","00:59,560","\"it fits into the theme quite well.\""]
["00:59,560","01:03,660","\"Because the game is called Lollipop Chainsaw and the use of Lollipops is quite effective.\""]
["01:03,660","01:04,660","\"Oh!\""]
["01:04,660","01:05,660","\"*laughs*\""]
["01:05,660","01:07,460","\"I heard the song!\""]
["01:07,460","01:11,160","\"If I was to name this game, I'd call it Cheer...\""]

["01:19,460","01:20,460","\"No.\""]
["01:20,460","01:21,460","\"Basically...\""]
["01:21,460","01:22,460","\"I feel okay.\""]

["01:48,460","01:50,460","\"I still alive. How am I still talking?\""]

["01:52,460","01:53,460","\"*laughs*\""]
["01:53,460","01:54,460","\"It's a form, uh...\""]
["01:54,460","01:56,460","\"It's a magical ritual on your head.\""]
["01:56,460","01:58,460","\"It was really hard.\""]
["01:58,460","02:02,460","\"And I don't mean to be a jerk, but I think maybe just a little bit of appreciation is in order.\""]
["02:02,460","02:04,460","\"If I didn't chop on your head,\""]
["02:04,460","02:07,460","\"the better one would pull my feet into your brain and turn you into a zombie.\""]
["02:07,460","02:08,460","\"That's so cool.\""]
["02:08,460","02:09,460","\"Juliet?\""]

["02:16,460","02:17,460","\"She's a zombie hunter.\""]
["02:17,460","02:42,180","\"hunter I know she did this to me okay this music school a lot of fits really\""]
["02:42,180","02:45,080","\"Yeah, they make great choices for almost every single one\""]
["02:45,080","02:48,960","\"Even the unused stuff. Yeah, it's true. There's\""]
["02:48,960","02:53,860","\"There is unused music on the disc as well as under really yeah\""]
["02:53,860","02:59,380","\"The final levels completely rushed and when we get to it, it is the worst part of this game by far. No\""]
["02:59,380","03:00,940","\"But\""]
["03:00,940","03:07,220","\"You'll be very happy with all the other boss fights. It's such a shame when a game ends on the worst thing. Yeah\""]
["03:08,340","03:13,760","\"Just don't put it in if that happens. Just don't yeah, I just put more time into what's before it\""]

["03:28,580","03:31,100","\"you know\""]
["03:33,540","03:40,340","\"That's a problem I see online a lot with videos where people will end the video after the funniest joke is in the middle of the video\""]
["03:40,340","03:43,060","\"Yeah, so why did you not save that for the end?\""]
["03:43,060","03:47,480","\"What I like is when you have the text on screen of what everybody's saying because it's fucking\""]
["03:47,480","03:51,280","\"This is on it. I hate that so fucking much more than anything\""]
["03:51,280","03:56,140","\"Can we start doing that? No funny moments and we put the text over the screen\""]
["03:56,140","04:02,420","\"I hate that every single online reviewer does that exact same style. I fucking hate it\""]
["04:02,420","04:07,940","\"I'm not saying we're highbrow. No, definitely not absolutely, but I wish they had their own fucking style\""]

["06:09,020","06:11,660","\"That's sad\""]

["06:49,860","06:56,040","\"It's a good game. I like the bad guy in it a lot. Yeah, which one they're all really good buff fucking business\""]
["06:56,040","07:00,360","\"Oh sundown no, that's Armstrong. Yeah, that's one of the best final boss fights\""]
["07:00,360","07:06,420","\"I could pick up to in like a recent game. I mean very good. Sam's campaign is way better. It's true. It is\""]

["07:42,300","07:46,100","\"That's a college too\""]
["07:46,100","07:54,140","\"I remember those one the first videos we did was no man's sky and we opened the video because we both we both burped at the same time\""]
["07:54,140","08:03,700","\"That's given speaking a no man's sky they updated the shit. Yeah, it actually looks fun now. It looks okay\""]
["08:03,700","08:09,460","\"I mean, I would okay not okay. I'm gonna jump the guy. It looks cool to explore with friends for me\""]
["08:09,460","08:14,180","\"Yeah, you can customize an appearance and there's multiplayer and stuff. Yeah, they're finally delivering on some of that\""]
["08:14,700","08:19,260","\"It's still screwed up that they lied so much before it's released, but at least they actually tried to fix it\""]
["08:19,260","08:23,420","\"Yeah, at least they're trying now, but um my biggest problem with that game isn't even that it's bad\""]
["08:23,420","08:28,340","\"I just wanted to fly around in space and seamlessly go from space to planet and fly around in canyons\""]
["08:28,340","08:33,140","\"But nothing really loads properly on time. You're also not allowed to remember it scare you away from\""]
["08:33,140","08:37,740","\"Yeah, they got to fix that really they fixed that yeah, you can crash into the earth\""]
["08:37,740","08:43,820","\"But it's still not that fun because you're flying around and things just kind of fade in and out of existence a lot\""]
["08:43,820","08:47,160","\"So you don't know what you're gonna hit anyway, so it's not that fun\""]
["08:47,160","08:54,280","\"Honestly if there was a procedurally generated like Canyon flyer game, I would fucking love that just dodging it in out of rocks\""]
["08:54,280","08:56,280","\"This stuff like a pod racer. I\""]
["08:56,280","08:59,660","\"Mean wasn't that game you showed us just that no I was a flying well\""]
["08:59,660","09:02,140","\"I mean that you're flying downward. I mean like just the\""]
["09:02,140","09:07,140","\"Well, I mean like just like a fucking pod racer like you're just a rock to the bottom\""]
["09:07,140","09:09,700","\"I remember pod racing because I was actually pretty good game\""]
["09:10,740","09:15,840","\"Like even really good atmosphere. I was a good game. It was a really fun way to that\""]
["09:15,840","09:20,780","\"I didn't even have an as I beat that emulated. I got obsessed with that when I was like 16\""]
["09:20,780","09:28,540","\"Discovering emulators when you're younger is the best feeling ever do you remember?\""]
["09:28,540","09:33,260","\"Nestacle I hate a nesticle. Hey, that was the one I hated I had an estopia\""]
["09:33,260","09:37,720","\"I liked nasticle because you could actually not like clicking on a testicle\""]
["09:38,940","09:44,420","\"Listen cuz I was an innocent dumb little boy. I didn't even know what the name man. I'm fucking serious\""]
["09:44,420","09:48,460","\"Yeah, it's like it looked gross. I know you I was a hairy testicle\""]
["09:48,460","09:50,740","\"I thought it was a hairy ass is what I thought about it\""]
["09:50,740","09:54,460","\"I told you this someone called me a fucking online when I was younger\""]
["09:54,460","09:56,460","\"I thought that was like an animal like a fairy or something\""]
["09:56,460","09:59,900","\"Oh, you know you\""]
["09:59,900","10:02,500","\"Really?\""]

["10:27,780","10:32,500","\"There was a really good Genesis fusion and gens. I forget which ones I think I had fusion\""]
["10:33,500","10:37,920","\"But yeah, Genesis emulation is pretty solid. I remember PS1 emulation sucked\""]
["10:37,920","10:45,100","\"You had to download the BIOS and everything straight from your PS1. Yeah, why don't they just fucking include it?\""]
["10:45,100","10:48,040","\"Well now they're legal. Oh it is. Yeah, that was good. Oh\""]
["10:48,040","10:52,840","\"That makes sense now. They have BIOS is ready for me like every country now, so just fuck around with it\""]
["10:52,840","10:57,620","\"To the people who don't even know the fuck we're talking about I'm sorry I\""]
