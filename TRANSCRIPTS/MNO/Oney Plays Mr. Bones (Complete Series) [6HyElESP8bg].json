["16:09,960","16:14,160","\"I love that stuff. It's like a rap though. It's probably the most fun part in this whole game\""]
["16:14,160","16:17,680","\"It was a really good way of doing it. They took away your guitar. Are there more?\""]
["16:17,680","16:25,040","\"Fun, that's it. No, I thought the whole game was gonna be like a guitar adventure. No, I wish I'm sorry\""]

["17:02,880","17:11,500","\"Peck like pelvis by the way this level sucks if that's not clear. This is the least fun part of this game\""]

["18:38,220","18:40,640","\"Yeah, my skeleton glowed in the dark\""]

["18:42,880","18:48,400","\"I picked up my finger until it came out. I know this game is running like shit\""]
["18:48,400","18:53,640","\"But the hitbox is seemed pretty good at least it's not running like shit look at mr. Bones. He's Lee looks\""]
["18:53,640","18:55,640","\"He's had a beautiful 60 frames per second\""]
["18:55,640","19:02,200","\"Yeah, cuz they had to make a fit it's two discs. Yeah, and stuff like this\""]
["19:02,200","19:06,280","\"Which is why it's on do surprise like the foreground and shit always is in front of you\""]

["19:11,040","19:14,960","\"I don't see a second CD games like this. I'm sorry Saturn my view\""]
["19:14,960","19:19,860","\"I would have loved this game as a kid. I fucking like that. Do you ever play Hugo the troll on PS1?\""]

["20:06,140","20:09,940","\"I know that but they don't have nerves on the outside your skeletons coming out\""]
["20:09,940","20:14,200","\"This is a good video.\""]

["21:00,660","21:04,340","\"Just do it to the rhythm. Yeah, it's I actually giving you anything\""]
["21:04,340","21:11,340","\"I mean it's up to you to because for a prep I guess kind of did that but you could easily just break it by mashing buttons around\""]
["21:11,340","21:14,060","\"That's true. Oh, Gemma Lammy's a lot better with it. Yeah, it is\""]
["21:14,060","21:20,220","\"To the point that if you just mash buttons it immediately takes you down a rank for doing it exactly. There's both rhythm\""]
["21:20,220","21:24,780","\"It's fun. Also something you're noticing now about Mr. Bones. These levels are way too long. Yeah\""]
["21:24,780","21:30,120","\"Guitar solo part one. There we go. Yeah, I was yours more. Okay. Don't press anything. You're dink done\""]
