["02:30,280","02:33,320","\"They're really fun because this is the one with the most monkeys so far.\""]
["02:33,320","02:34,320","\"You can just ignore it.\""]
["02:34,320","02:35,320","\"I think you have to get a least.\""]
["02:35,320","02:38,240","\"At the end of the game, remember, there's like five levels back to back where it's like,\""]
["02:38,240","02:39,240","\"oh, catch-spector.\""]
["02:39,240","02:40,680","\"And then you move on to the next level.\""]

["02:49,880","02:52,960","\"That's the tank mission. Yeah, this level looks really cool\""]
["02:52,960","02:57,400","\"And then you don't get a good ending out the door because you have to go back and catch every single monkey in the game\""]
["02:57,400","02:59,900","\"But the boss fights pretty good. Oh, no the cat\""]
["02:59,900","03:10,240","\"Use your first Chris, huh you realize George Lucas will never want to work with you now why not\""]

["03:21,880","03:23,680","\"I didn't say that.\""]
["03:23,680","03:25,760","\"I just said it was a funny scenario.\""]
["03:25,760","03:26,840","\"It didn't happen.\""]
["03:26,840","03:27,840","\"It's okay, George.\""]
["03:27,840","03:29,840","\"Alright, yes it did.\""]
["03:29,840","03:32,240","\"I bought a couple of shorns.\""]

["03:34,440","03:39,680","\"If you could mix any two fictional or non-fictional people together, who would you do?\""]
["03:39,680","03:43,720","\"That little kid from you walk tails and present bush\""]
["03:43,720","03:48,920","\"Okay, he's not a president former president Bush there you go\""]

["04:25,680","04:31,000","\"Would you enjoy Kingdom Hearts as much if it was starring Reggie Reggie Fizzamy?\""]
["04:31,000","04:35,880","\"Probably not. I don't like looking at him every time a character talks to him\""]
["04:35,880","04:41,260","\"He just doesn't say anything. He just makes that face at them puckers his lips up. Who is that guy who hosts the game awards?\""]
["04:41,260","04:44,360","\"No, that was a\""]
["04:44,360","04:51,320","\"What's his name Jeff? Jeff Keeley. That's it. Okay. What would you do if Jeff Keeley walked in?\""]
["04:51,320","04:57,220","\"Put his drink down on the table angry jail would walk in for him and say he's fucking with me\""]

["05:08,640","05:13,820","\"Angry Joe around the parking lot slapping him in the face. It'd be really funny. I mean\""]
["05:13,820","05:18,140","\"That's the equivalent of that video angry Joe uploaded anyways\""]
["05:18,140","05:23,760","\"No, it was and Jeff Kealey was really nice about it. But that's what I'm saying Joe's be that though\""]
["05:23,760","05:29,360","\"That's what I'm saying though is that angry Joe's really really pissed off with him trying to start fighting\""]
["05:29,360","05:32,280","\"He's just slapping him around what if but he's not slapping him around\""]
["05:32,280","05:38,840","\"He's just answering his questions like intelligently. What would you do if a video got released where he's actually just being really mean bully to him?\""]
["05:38,840","05:43,760","\"Uh, I'd be disappointed because the video that already exists was\""]
["05:43,760","05:49,880","\"Probably as good as it could get. It's true. And he walked I love the way he walks in front of his own video\""]
["05:49,880","05:53,480","\"It's like the emperor's new groove\""]

["06:17,800","06:18,800","\"No.\""]
["06:18,800","06:22,800","\"And then he stops the video and goes, \"\"Fo Fantasy did come out this year!\""]
["06:22,800","06:25,800","\"He's messing with me!\"\"\""]
["06:25,800","06:28,800","\"Chris, if you make a horrible mistake, be sure to upload it.\""]
["06:28,800","06:30,800","\"Upload it and interrupt yourself and say\""]

["08:41,660","08:42,500","\"- That's fine, it'll be funny.\""]
["08:42,500","08:45,500","\"It's hard to tell jokes when you're not allowed to tell jokes anymore.\""]
["08:45,500","08:50,000","\"No, for anyone who doesn't know, for anyone who's like not in the loop,\""]

["09:01,500","09:02,500","\"Was it like the title of the game or something?\""]
["09:02,500","09:04,500","\"No, he was just showing like Windows applications.\""]
["09:04,500","09:06,000","\"There was nothing in it.\""]

["09:08,000","09:10,000","\"And he got hit and like-\""]
["09:10,000","09:11,500","\"He's one of the tainless channels.\""]
["09:11,500","09:16,500","\"No, really at like lots of people we know are getting hit and it's like YouTube just demonetizes them because\""]

["09:21,700","09:25,980","\"Well, it doesn't work. That's the problem. The best thing about it is that when you have a question\""]
["09:25,980","09:27,340","\"There's no one to ask\""]
["09:27,340","09:31,500","\"Yeah, cuz they don't respond to anybody. It's because the CEO doesn't know what the fuck she's doing\""]
["09:31,500","09:33,780","\"Well, it's also because they can get away with it. Yeah\""]
["09:33,780","09:35,780","\"She's not enough that nobody would ever exactly\""]
["09:37,220","09:42,900","\"There have also been so many last straw situations where people are like, \"\"Oh, this is it.\""]

["09:45,220","09:46,740","\"There's nobody's willing to leave.\"\"\""]
["09:46,740","09:50,260","\"It's kind of that situation where if a couple big wigs go to a nose,\""]
["09:50,260","09:53,940","\"somewhere else like PewDiePie or Markiplier, it'll maybe change, but it probably won't.\""]
["09:53,940","09:56,660","\"It's never gonna change because Google bought YouTube and they're like,\""]
["09:56,660","09:57,860","\"\"\"This is gonna make us lots of money.\"\"\""]
["09:57,860","10:00,980","\"It's also a lot of immigrants, so they don't care about it.\""]
["10:00,980","10:02,100","\"There's no point to it.\""]
