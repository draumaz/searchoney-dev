["00:54,620","00:55,460","\"Why is he?\""]
["00:55,460","00:56,660","\"There be a baby.\""]

["01:20,660","01:24,580","\"If I say a lot of words, maybe I'll\""]
["01:24,580","01:26,860","\"pretend to understand what's going on.\""]
["01:26,860","01:29,260","\"Maybe people will think there's a story.\""]
["01:29,260","01:33,260","\"And I feel like that's like closest to reality.\""]
["01:33,260","01:41,020","\"What are the odds that Tatsuye and Yumura actually wrote a story?\""]
["01:41,020","01:43,420","\"Like, and it all means something.\""]
["01:43,420","01:44,420","\"What are the odds of that?\""]
["01:44,420","01:48,620","\"Three out of 10.\""]

["02:02,420","02:03,420","\"But...\""]
["02:03,420","02:04,420","\"But...\""]
["02:04,420","02:05,420","\"Maybe.\""]
["02:05,420","02:06,420","\"Just maybe.\""]
["02:06,420","02:10,420","\"I think there's a slight-- you can always account for a slight chance, which is not bad.\""]
["02:10,420","02:11,420","\"DOGG!\""]
["02:11,420","02:13,420","\"Nobody can ever know for sure, but...\""]
["02:13,420","02:18,420","\"Specifically, this game really feels like they were just pulling stuff out of their ass.\""]

["06:26,220","06:37,780","\"game. I recognize that. I bought mine from Sangeak. I bought my top top. We've fought\""]

["06:46,640","06:52,960","\"that was entirely in that style? Kingdom Hearts? Of like, well specifically of like people\""]
["06:52,960","06:57,640","\"pretending to do action like role play shit in real life. That would probably be the best\""]
["06:57,640","07:02,220","\"film I'd ever seen. Like it's actually like a fantasy film but it takes place in somebody's\""]
["07:02,220","07:07,580","\"neighborhood yeah I'd love that would you watch that I probably would if there\""]
["07:07,580","07:11,060","\"was an hour and a half movie of those guys reenacting at Kingdom Hearts that\""]

["07:52,260","07:56,900","\"Look at the camera. Are you keeping up with everything?\""]
["07:56,900","08:02,020","\"Be sure to take notes in the back of the instruction manual\""]
["08:02,020","08:11,580","\"Actually, I remember the day when I got a I bought a game and it didn't have an instruction manual. It really made me sad\""]
["08:11,580","08:13,580","\"Yeah, I remember that too.\""]
["08:13,580","08:18,580","\"I always like collecting them blackbuster. They didn't care if he took one home.\""]
["08:18,580","08:23,580","\"It was really nice when, you know, games would put a lot of extra effort into their instructions.\""]
["08:23,580","08:24,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:24,580","08:26,580","\"And like, make them colored and full of like...\""]
["08:26,580","08:30,580","\"Yeah, well that was the... I remember the one for Kingdom Hearts was not colored. It was black and white.\""]
["08:30,580","08:31,580","\"I remember.\""]
["08:31,580","08:38,580","\"And I was like, already disappointed back then because I was used to Nintendo instruction books that had colors.\""]
["08:38,580","08:42,420","\"Remember Zelda oracles? Oracle of seasons and ages?\""]
["08:42,420","08:43,460","\"I sure do, Chris.\""]
["08:43,460","08:46,260","\"They had really good little instruction books.\""]
["08:46,260","08:51,460","\"I'm pretty sure that that instruction book is what really nailed the coffin and turned me gay,\""]
["08:51,460","08:54,660","\"because I really liked looking at the muscly zoras in it.\""]
["08:54,660","08:55,620","\"Did you have that game?\""]
["08:55,620","08:56,020","\"I did.\""]

["08:56,900","08:57,620","\"Yeah, that was my...\""]
["08:57,620","09:00,100","\"No, that was not my first game.\""]
["09:00,100","09:01,780","\"My first game was Pokemon Gold.\""]
["09:01,780","09:03,300","\"That was my first Zelda game.\""]
["09:03,300","09:03,860","\"I loved it.\""]
["09:03,860","09:04,980","\"That was also my first Zelda game.\""]
["09:04,980","09:06,340","\"That's probably my favorite Zelda game.\""]
["09:06,340","09:08,180","\"I think I'd say the same.\""]
["09:08,180","09:09,180","\"I like it a lot.\""]
["09:09,180","09:12,300","\"Why did Capcom make such good Zelda games?\""]
["09:12,300","09:13,340","\"That's a good question.\""]
["09:13,340","09:14,900","\"They did.\""]
["09:14,900","09:15,340","\"They should.\""]
["09:15,340","09:16,860","\"They should be allowed to do it again.\""]
["09:16,860","09:17,340","\"They did.\""]
["09:17,340","09:19,580","\"Mine is kept to right.\""]
["09:19,580","09:19,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:19,980","09:21,620","\"They sure like that one too.\""]
["09:21,620","09:23,060","\"That's probably my second favorite.\""]
["09:23,060","09:24,340","\"I've never actually played that one.\""]
["09:24,340","09:27,500","\"But what about the legend of Mario?\""]
["09:27,500","09:28,780","\"Do you like that game?\""]
["09:28,780","09:31,180","\"Is that a flash game from 2004?\""]
["09:31,180","09:31,820","\"That's right.\""]
["09:31,820","09:32,500","\"I made it.\""]
["09:32,500","09:36,820","\"Oh, you fight Sonic the Hedgehog on top of Mount Everest.\""]
["09:36,820","09:40,160","\"Remember I'm the guy who reviewed it and said please kill yourself soon\""]
["09:40,160","09:46,560","\"I remember that and I didn't like it too much Zelda in the new warrior order you responded and said I'll do it\""]
["09:46,560","09:49,820","\"I'll fucking do it. I did say that\""]
["09:49,820","09:55,280","\"Never have it. Do you remember the first thing you remember watching on new grounds?\""]
["09:55,280","09:59,620","\"Let me think\""]
["09:59,620","10:05,200","\"It was probably one of the celebrity death videos. They had a whole category for it\""]
["10:05,560","10:08,860","\"Do you remember the yeah, Tom fault made a few of those\""]
["10:08,860","10:14,880","\"He made one where you beat up Britney Spears boyfriend and Britney Spears\""]
["10:14,880","10:21,640","\"I remember that you beat it's a K-fed remember. Yeah, Jeff animated it and so did Stanford. I think\""]
["10:21,640","10:26,020","\"It's kind of mean kind of bully behavior\""]
["10:26,020","10:31,480","\"At child he's accusing you Chris\""]
["10:33,080","10:38,180","\"If in every single court case till the end of time they use that to point at the criminal when they sentence him\""]
["10:38,180","10:40,980","\"Yes, it's a little bit\""]
["10:40,980","10:45,500","\"I was holding a handgun up to you like that. Would you be intimidated by him?\""]
["10:45,500","10:51,020","\"Because that facial expression was pretty dead to me. Yeah, like he doesn't he doesn't care\""]
["10:51,020","10:53,020","\"He had a weird about the holly baby\""]
["10:53,020","10:57,920","\"If you shaved off all of Sora's hair, he'd probably just look like a little baby man\""]
