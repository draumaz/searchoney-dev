["00:02,000","00:06,720","\"Hello hello\""]
["00:06,720","00:09,500","\"Can you fucking hear me?\""]
["00:09,500","00:23,040","\"Hey everybody this is the\""]
["00:23,040","00:25,420","\"This is pretty much\""]
["00:25,420","00:30,940","\"Gonna be the only slays video for this year because I didn't have time to sit down and record Christmas games with anybody\""]
["00:30,940","00:37,660","\"But I'm going to take your suggestions and make some Christmas themed shit\""]
["00:37,660","00:40,480","\"And we're gonna put it all into a nice little scene at the end\""]
["00:40,480","00:42,060","\"so\""]
["00:42,060","00:46,020","\"Give me suggestions Christmas things I could start with Santa or\""]
["00:46,020","00:52,020","\"Rude elf make a hyper realistic snowman. I could start with a snowman. That would be very simple actually\""]
["00:52,020","00:58,060","\"Let's first actually just put a ground underneath everything. So here's a plane\""]
["00:58,060","01:01,140","\"Let's center it check this shit out\""]
["01:01,140","01:07,320","\"It's just going to be a fucking amazing. This will be the start of the scene. So you can subdivide it\""]
["01:07,320","01:09,420","\"Buh-buh, then you can so\""]
["01:09,420","01:14,340","\"Lidify it. You know what? I'm gonna put that on top actually. So it's like sure\""]
["01:14,340","01:16,620","\"make sure to\""]
["01:16,620","01:21,640","\"To light a fire next to your feet and put your feet in it to simulate the Christmas, you know\""]
["01:21,640","01:23,700","\"I'm gonna delete these balls. I don't need all these balls\""]
["01:23,700","01:26,720","\"What we've started with here is a nice little hill\""]
["01:26,720","01:33,400","\"Gonna go smooth it and I'm gonna add the little snow shader. I made so here's our hill\""]
["01:33,400","01:37,100","\"As you can see it looks great\""]
["01:37,100","01:43,700","\"Here's our light our overall light for the scene. Do you think we should make like an a nighty kind of outdoor snow scene?\""]
["01:44,980","01:49,380","\"Because if so we'll have to light it from the back like that and make it kind of a dark blue\""]
["01:49,380","01:55,020","\"Ooh, I'll take this ball. Let's make a little snow friend. Shall we?\""]
["01:55,020","02:02,740","\"Check it out. It's already perfect\""]
["02:02,740","02:08,980","\"It's already if oh, it's so beautiful. Maybe you should put a little fire a little beautiful fire in there\""]
["02:08,980","02:11,820","\"Maybe all right, so let's make some kind of fake-ass fire\""]
["02:13,820","02:17,660","\"Look we'll put in a UV sphere\""]
["02:17,660","02:22,180","\"Bring that shit over. This is the fire now\""]
["02:22,180","02:25,340","\"This is gonna be amazing\""]
["02:25,340","02:27,700","\"That is fucking photorealistic fire\""]
["02:27,700","02:31,060","\"No effort easy\""]
["02:31,060","02:38,500","\"Wow, oh look real fire and rendered Wow\""]
["02:41,540","02:46,660","\"That is so fucking beautiful. All right, so now we can add more detail to this snowman\""]
["02:46,660","02:54,540","\"I'm gonna duplicate this sphere up here bring it towards us make it smiao put it on his beautiful little head\""]
["02:54,540","03:02,200","\"Christmas baby I check this out. Oh\""]
["03:02,200","03:06,300","\"You know what this is blue I'm gonna make this\""]
["03:06,300","03:10,700","\"Blackie where's the good black\""]
["03:10,700","03:20,020","\"shiny black there you go delete you aww and now we got to give him a scarf a\""]
["03:20,020","03:29,340","\"hat and a nose when I just duplicate this little shift in Z is an easy way to\""]
["03:29,340","03:34,020","\"change rendered mode oh thank you I didn't know that look it's a beautiful\""]
["03:34,020","03:42,820","\"little schnaz. And now we could turn on clay strips, which I really like. You can do that.\""]
["03:42,820","03:53,140","\"Oh, there you go. Oh, now back to the render. Look at that.\""]
["04:02,420","04:04,420","\"Let's go burn victim snowman\""]
["04:04,420","04:06,900","\"Okay\""]
["04:06,900","04:11,060","\"Let's see how that looks there you go\""]
["04:11,060","04:18,340","\"You can't even see the detail cuz there's so much subsurf if I turn down his subsurf you'll see it there you go\""]
["04:18,340","04:22,620","\"I like a bit of subsurf though\""]
["04:22,620","04:29,940","\"We'll keep it like there. Okay. Let's give him a hat. Let's give or scarf even so I would just make a Taurus or like that\""]
["04:29,940","04:35,500","\"Okay, and now we can sculpt this sculpt sculpt. Let's give him a blue scarf\""]
["04:35,500","04:38,020","\"This is not gonna look good, but whatever\""]
["04:38,020","04:40,820","\"smoothy smooth\""]
["04:40,820","04:48,100","\"As long as it looks good from the camera view that's all that matters. Oh look at this a real fucking scarf\""]
["04:48,100","04:51,500","\"That's just wonderful\""]
["04:51,500","04:57,360","\"He could just give him an afro\""]
["04:58,620","05:00,620","\"Hello\""]
["05:00,620","05:03,300","\"I'll delete it here\""]

["05:09,460","05:14,380","\"Okay, so this time it's gonna be small. I'm gonna bring up the bottom\""]
["05:14,380","05:16,980","\"With proportional editing\""]
["05:16,980","05:21,940","\"So that's the bottom of the hat. It's not the best, but hey it'll do\""]
["05:21,940","05:27,580","\"Hmm. Okay. There you go, and then add a white to this\""]
["05:27,580","05:32,220","\"and smoothen it and now let's have a look\""]

["05:54,580","05:56,580","\"Sculpt it.\""]
["05:56,580","05:58,580","\"Dine on tall ball.\""]
["05:58,580","06:01,580","\"And now he's got a little, little stick hand.\""]

["06:02,580","06:05,580","\"No, don't do that.\""]

["06:07,580","06:08,580","\"There you go.\""]
["06:08,580","06:09,580","\"Perfect.\""]
["06:09,580","06:12,580","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["06:12,580","06:15,580","\"Okay, now let's make a, who we making?\""]
["06:15,580","06:17,580","\"All right, let's do an elf.\""]
["06:17,580","06:18,580","\"I'm doing an elf, okay.\""]
["06:18,580","06:19,580","\"An elf, an elf, an elf.\""]
["06:19,580","06:22,580","\"Add a UV sphere and drag it.\""]
["06:22,580","06:26,820","\"Lala Lulu he he he now here's the elf\""]
["06:26,820","06:31,180","\"This is gonna be the worst elf so we're gonna do it like this\""]
["06:31,180","06:33,780","\"Beno top all\""]
["06:33,780","06:35,780","\"snake hook\""]
["06:35,780","06:40,620","\"Sweet dude\""]
["06:40,620","06:47,320","\"Look at that little guy okay, let's give him ears\""]

["07:02,120","07:05,980","\"Oh, let's give him a skin shader\""]
["07:05,980","07:13,580","\"Scan scan scan where's this scan there you go. Let's see how he looks\""]
["07:17,780","07:21,860","\"He looks fucking great. These are from the champ. Enzi. I made the other day\""]
["07:21,860","07:26,400","\"Let's drag those on over here\""]
["07:26,400","07:30,540","\"There you go. Let's see what he looks like\""]
["07:30,540","07:41,940","\"He looks so great, why does he look like he was burned alive?\""]
["07:42,460","07:48,620","\"Also the lighting here is kind of shit. Let's uh, let's add a spotlight. Let's rotate it towards the little man\""]
["07:48,620","07:53,580","\"There you go, this should look a lot better. Aw\""]
["07:53,580","07:58,140","\"He's wonderful. He really does look like a burn victim doesn't he?\""]
["07:58,140","08:02,700","\"I wonder, well, he looks scary if I give him the chimp teeth\""]
["08:02,700","08:05,820","\"Okay\""]
["08:05,820","08:07,820","\"We'll move him into his head\""]
["08:07,820","08:10,060","\"I'll shrink him down a little bit more\""]
["08:10,460","08:15,920","\"Now they're inside of his head so we can actually sculpt him his mouth into his teeth\""]
["08:15,920","08:19,420","\"So if we do it like\""]
["08:19,420","08:22,380","\"Like that\""]
["08:22,380","08:34,380","\"Might not use this is what it looked like we need to clothe him\""]
["08:34,380","08:39,760","\"Just give him a little hat. Hey check this out a scuba to do\""]
["08:39,760","08:45,560","\"Now I just give him a little diaper and he said it's it's photorealistic\""]
["08:45,560","08:48,560","\"Merry Christmas\""]
["08:48,560","08:57,520","\"Music kicks in for this really\""]
["08:57,520","09:07,480","\"Let me just show you a trick we'll make it we'll make the diaper shader we'll call it the old diaper\""]
["09:08,200","09:15,160","\"Okay, I spelled it wrong the diaper shader. All right. This is how you make a stained diaper\""]
["09:15,160","09:18,500","\"Set that to the principal to BSDF\""]
["09:18,500","09:22,720","\"add input texture coordinates add\""]
["09:22,720","09:28,600","\"Texture noise. I'm just gonna plug that into the base so I can see it for now\""]
["09:28,600","09:30,920","\"I'm gonna turn the detail up to 16\""]
["09:30,920","09:36,120","\"Turn the scale down to like two you'll see why in a minute. Okay, so add\""]
["09:37,720","09:43,080","\"Converter coloramp, so I'm gonna use this to get the stains just how I want them\""]
["09:43,080","09:48,920","\"There you go vector mapping now we can move this texture around\""]
["09:48,920","09:52,600","\"There you go\""]
["09:52,600","10:01,380","\"Looks like he's pissing himself right now look it's already like a beautiful nativity look at that wow\""]

["16:57,280","17:03,280","\"Let's go to Metallic and Roughness to like that.\""]
["17:03,280","17:07,280","\"And we'll set the base to like red.\""]
["17:07,280","17:11,280","\"This is gonna not look the best, but it will look fine for what we're doing.\""]
["17:11,280","17:16,280","\"I'm gonna copy this.\""]
["17:16,280","17:19,280","\"I'm gonna call it Red Press.\""]
["17:19,280","17:24,280","\"I'm gonna call this one.\""]
["17:24,280","17:27,280","\"Green press.\""]
["17:27,280","17:32,280","\"And there we have it.\""]
["17:32,280","17:33,280","\"Now let's see.\""]
["17:33,280","17:35,280","\"Oh look at the present.\""]
["17:35,280","17:37,280","\"Here we go, here we go.\""]
["17:37,280","17:39,280","\"Now let's see how that looks.\""]
["17:39,280","17:42,280","\"Please don't look like shit after all of that.\""]
["17:42,280","17:50,280","\"Oh look at that.\""]
["17:50,280","17:59,000","\"that that looks great I can't believe that worked now a candy cane I don't know if I\""]
["17:59,000","18:07,540","\"can do that even put one behind the snowman but he's burning them why is there a snowman\""]
["18:07,540","18:19,520","\"next to a fire anyways Rudolph the stupid asshole that's stuck in the snow then he died\""]
["18:19,520","18:23,680","\"a candy cane come up here. Alright, I'll do that next. Let's see if this works.\""]
["18:23,680","18:42,240","\"That doesn't look okay. Let me try again. Let's try this. Let's make it reflect or do that.\""]
["18:46,400","18:52,720","\"That looks pretty pretty decent. It's not the best, but it will clearly get the job done\""]
["18:52,720","18:57,640","\"If there's it fucking huge oops, burn it over here\""]
["18:57,640","19:00,480","\"Shrinky down\""]
["19:00,480","19:06,860","\"There you go, it's a little elves little stick right there\""]
["19:06,860","19:10,000","\"All right\""]

["19:12,680","19:16,040","\"Pull out a little bit like that\""]
["19:16,040","19:25,100","\"and we'll put these more over here to fill out that empty space and we'll have\""]

["19:37,160","19:45,160","\"why am I doing this you ask? Because I am cool. No because this will act as fog.\""]
["19:45,160","19:47,720","\"We'll see if it takes too long.\""]
["19:47,720","19:53,160","\"Volume Scatter is what we need.\""]
["19:53,160","19:54,760","\"We need to plug it into the volume.\""]
["19:54,760","19:57,480","\"And then, let's have a look.\""]
["19:57,480","20:02,160","\"It's completely dark as you can see.\""]
["20:02,160","20:04,840","\"So you need to turn the density down to 0.01.\""]
["20:04,840","20:07,480","\"(laughs)\""]
["20:07,480","20:08,520","\"Look at that.\""]
["20:08,520","20:11,120","\"And then turn the An, Anis Trophy,\""]

["20:16,680","20:19,800","\"That's kind of cool.\""]
["20:19,800","20:21,800","\"Actually, it's not taking so long either.\""]
["20:21,800","20:29,040","\"So this is what we do to make Santi stand out.\""]
["20:29,040","20:31,200","\"We'll put a huge ass light behind him.\""]
["20:31,200","20:33,540","\"(humming)\""]
["20:33,540","20:41,400","\"It's a little too bright.\""]
["20:41,400","20:43,080","\"We can turn that down a notch\""]
["20:44,320","20:48,040","\"And we could change the color of the light to something scary.\""]
["20:48,040","20:49,040","\"Like green.\""]
["20:49,040","20:50,040","\"Hey.\""]
["20:50,040","20:51,040","\"All right.\""]
["20:51,040","20:54,040","\"It's kind of cool.\""]

["23:02,520","23:05,620","\"Guys if I give him stigma while I get in trouble, I honestly don't know\""]
["23:05,620","23:08,780","\"Okay, let's just do it\""]
["23:08,780","23:15,420","\"God damn\""]
["23:15,420","23:17,660","\"God damn\""]
["23:17,660","23:20,320","\"Let's give him the sting\""]
["23:20,320","23:27,040","\"Minus X to plus X no do X to my dare. Yeah go\""]
["23:28,720","23:35,140","\"Now yay, the baby has holes everybody now ain't that special\""]
["23:35,140","23:45,960","\"Now look at that\""]
["23:45,960","23:55,680","\"Mary Jesus so now this should look pretty freaking good, okay, let's see oh\""]
["23:57,880","24:00,340","\"Fuck yes, that is the baby JP\""]
["24:00,340","24:05,280","\"That is Jayper's Crapers have ever seen him\""]
["24:05,280","24:19,400","\"Look at that look at that not the best diaper around but it'll get the job done\""]
["24:23,360","24:28,120","\"Need to fix it up a bit. Maybe this Jesus one shouldn't be piston\""]
["24:28,120","24:33,600","\"Aced\""]
["24:33,600","24:35,800","\"Jesus diaper\""]
["24:35,800","24:40,120","\"The door door door give my yamaka. He was a Jew\""]
["24:40,120","24:49,640","\"I don't think he came out of his mother wearing a yamaka. Okay. All right. We give him a little sub surf on the old diaper\""]
["24:51,520","24:56,800","\"Like this color. Yeah, look at that and there you go. There you have it\""]
["24:56,800","25:02,080","\"Everything's hidden that needs to be hidden. I think that's it. I think that's the picture\""]
["25:02,080","25:14,480","\"So I'm gonna make Jesus's face stand out a little more\""]
["25:14,480","25:19,200","\"I think it's cuz the subsurface turned up super high. Oh, it's cuz he's in the background as well\""]
["25:19,680","25:23,480","\"So I need to move him closer to the fire. So Jesus you need\""]
["25:23,480","25:29,280","\"That like so fucking scary\""]
["25:29,280","25:32,600","\"It's an orange\""]
["25:32,600","25:38,780","\"The little cracks in his eyes are actually black now because of that. Let's see\""]
["25:38,780","25:45,720","\"That kind of helps also the subsurface up way too high so you turn that down\""]
["25:45,720","25:48,920","\"I'm gonna add an input to value node\""]
["25:48,920","25:57,640","\"and plug that into the radius. That helped. Turn it down, down. God, his little lumpy\""]
["25:57,640","26:11,560","\"skin is so gross. And for displacement, we can earn that up a bit. There you go. Oh,\""]
["26:11,560","26:15,360","\"His hand is sick. Okay, I'm gonna put him back. See how he looks\""]
["26:15,360","26:23,240","\"Over the fire and with a halo\""]
["26:23,240","26:34,920","\"Oh, how cute okay, I think that's good. I think that's it everybody\""]
