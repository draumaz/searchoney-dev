["18:29,380","18:32,820","\"And even now, I went specifically to enjoy it.\""]
["18:32,820","18:36,060","\"And after about 20 seconds after the sun rose,\""]
["18:36,060","18:39,620","\"It was like, \"\"I call 'em out!\"\"\""]

["18:41,620","18:43,100","\"- I mean, it's beautiful.\""]
["18:43,100","18:44,580","\"I took a couple photos.\""]

["19:10,060","19:12,340","\"and I ended up stumbling across the Grand Canyon\""]
["19:12,340","19:14,460","\"and I, you know, camped out next to it\""]
["19:14,460","19:16,540","\"and I could just admire it all night.\""]
["19:16,540","19:19,900","\"I think, you know, obviously it would just be magical\""]
["19:19,900","19:22,380","\"in its majesty, but just be--\""]
