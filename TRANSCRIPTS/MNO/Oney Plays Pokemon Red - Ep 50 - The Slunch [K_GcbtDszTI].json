["00:07,440","00:11,360","\"And then someone just yells at you and you're like, \"\"Wow, I just want it to help.\"\"\""]
["00:11,360","00:15,560","\"It's weird when people do that, when they ask for help sometimes too,\""]
["00:15,560","00:21,440","\"and then as you're trying to help them, they just get mad at you and go, \"\"I don't like doing this though! I don't want to do this!\"\"\""]
["00:21,440","00:27,480","\"'Cause it's like, \"\"Why'd you ask? Why do you want assistance if you're just gonna start biting the head off of the person who's trying to assist you?\"\"\""]
["00:27,480","00:30,400","\"The opposite of that is when you go to someone and you're like,\""]

["00:40,940","00:41,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:41,100","00:44,380","\"Three times and every time it makes me despise the person.\""]
["00:44,380","00:46,940","\"Because if someone came to me with a really specific problem,\""]
["00:46,940","00:48,680","\"I fucking love to help them with it.\""]
["00:48,680","00:53,840","\"I love explaining really specific things that like gave me trouble.\""]
["00:53,840","00:54,340","\"Right.\""]
["00:54,340","00:57,260","\"I'm really bad at trying to explain things to people.\""]
["00:57,260","01:02,320","\"So it's like I'm trying to do it. I think I'm good at explaining things to people. I'm good at baby language\""]

["01:13,500","01:16,040","\"But yeah, no shit pisses me off\""]
["01:16,040","01:19,620","\"I just there was a point when I made friends with a guy who did\""]
["01:19,620","01:21,760","\"Like you know music shit\""]
["01:21,760","01:26,960","\"And I was like I noticed you have this exact same plug and I use and I cannot for the life of me figure\""]
["01:26,960","01:32,980","\"I had to make it sound good. Is there any tricks? He was just like yeah, but like just figure it out out like\""]
["01:32,980","01:36,540","\"Okay, I\""]
["01:36,540","01:40,800","\"Can understand that in situations where it would be too difficult to explain\""]
["01:40,800","01:45,560","\"It's not though all all all he had to I figured it out on my own like after like months of trying it\""]
["01:45,560","01:49,940","\"All it was was he he had to say was you need to modulate something more\""]
["01:49,940","01:54,760","\"It was as easy as that literally and he had the time to respond and say no\""]
["01:54,840","01:57,080","\"So it's like what the fuck is wrong with you?\""]
["01:57,080","02:05,200","\"Like I get you can't be explaining everything to everybody all the time, but I don't know when someone's nice and comes to me\""]
["02:05,200","02:07,200","\"And they're very polite about it. I like\""]
["02:07,200","02:12,880","\"Explaining well, did he phrase it directly as like figured out yourself or something it what he said essentially was\""]
["02:12,880","02:16,120","\"Like I don't want to make more competition for myself\""]
["02:16,120","02:22,920","\"Back of my mind is is he doing this just because he wants to keep the trade secrets\""]
["02:22,920","02:25,320","\"It's just that that's the shittiest thing to me though.\""]
["02:25,320","02:30,680","\"I mean, it's also someone can just observe what you did and figure it out.\""]
["02:30,680","02:32,440","\"Yeah, like, I don't know.\""]
["02:32,440","02:34,840","\"He was a real pompous asshole.\""]
