["06:55,620","06:57,620","\"I don't know\""]
["06:57,620","07:02,380","\"Because they have to make them certain colors, I guess they are though. They're not they're blue\""]
["07:02,380","07:04,980","\"That would mean that the red should attract them\""]
["07:04,980","07:09,380","\"They should just be they should just be metal and then means because metal points are blue\""]
["07:09,380","07:15,180","\"So metals get attracted to silver magnets anyway blue lettering on them see blue z\""]
["07:15,180","07:22,900","\"So you think the red would attract them, I think they should have done more with the gimmick though. Yeah, there you go\""]
