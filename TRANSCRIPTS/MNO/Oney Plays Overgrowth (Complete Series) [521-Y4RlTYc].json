["07:47,220","07:49,800","\"That's true. Can you do a frinkin style?\""]
["07:49,800","07:52,440","\"Oh, wow, why did that kill you?\""]

["08:45,160","08:48,880","\"So there's a few more mechanics to this game is you can wield knives and you can throw\""]
["08:48,880","08:49,880","\"them.\""]
["08:49,880","08:51,400","\"There's a dedicated screaming button.\""]

["09:06,000","09:06,600","\"Did you?\""]
["09:06,600","09:06,920","\"Ragged the six flags.\""]
["09:06,920","09:07,960","\"It's just a bunch of hills.\""]
["09:07,960","09:10,120","\"Did you used to roll down hills when you were a kid?\""]
["09:10,120","09:11,960","\"Was that a thing everybody did?\""]
["09:11,960","09:13,040","\"Yeah, no, that's fun.\""]
["09:13,040","09:14,400","\"OK, it is fun.\""]
["09:14,400","09:15,880","\"This is Skizzo the rat.\""]
["09:15,880","09:16,400","\"What's his deal?\""]
["09:16,400","09:17,720","\"Skizzo.\""]
["09:17,720","09:20,360","\"Oh, Oi, what does Stonefist want now?\""]
["09:20,360","09:22,720","\"We're not done surveying the damage.\""]
["09:22,720","09:24,640","\"Well, Stonefisting you and why.\""]
["09:24,640","09:27,280","\"What are you?\""]
["09:27,280","09:28,200","\"What the hell?\""]
["09:28,200","09:28,880","\"These guys are--\""]
["09:28,880","09:29,960","\"You just appeared.\""]
["09:29,960","09:30,960","\"You sure did.\""]
["09:30,960","09:32,400","\"Oh, you want to know something else that's cool?\""]
["09:32,400","09:33,720","\"What was the haul?\""]
["09:33,720","09:38,760","\"The developer put it in the game so that you can actually make your own scenarios and type in your own dialogue and shit\""]
["09:38,760","09:45,960","\"Whoa, no kidding. The cool thing is is that every pose is is laid in manually. I don't know why I said it manually\""]
["09:45,960","09:48,200","\"but uh, so\""]
["09:48,200","09:53,160","\"There's a little bit of like jiggle bone on everything so that when the poses change from one post to another\""]
["09:53,160","09:58,340","\"It's like procedural and they didn't actually animate it, but it looks really good because of the physics itself. Huh?\""]
["09:59,320","10:04,080","\"So I like that sounds very hard to do, but I am not a programmer now climb up there the green lights\""]
["10:04,080","10:07,120","\"Whoa, so you got like Prince of Persia kind of shit go\""]
["10:07,120","10:08,200","\"Wow\""]
["10:08,200","10:11,200","\"Little rabbit claw marks on the walls so you know where to go yeah\""]
["10:11,200","10:13,200","\"I know and I think that's better than just making them yellow\""]
["10:13,200","10:16,080","\"Like every other fucking game. I do like that\""]
["10:16,080","10:21,040","\"I like that you can tell just by the textures like okay stuff is moving along the surface\""]
["10:21,040","10:23,860","\"Yeah, so you should probably do it too. Oh shit\""]
["10:23,860","10:28,520","\"You can see all the other rabbits clob their way up. Oops. I was doing so good\""]
["10:28,520","10:32,820","\"Let's try that again. Oh, I got to the top apparently. Okay. See how to checkpoint. Yeah\""]
["10:32,820","10:35,760","\"The checkpoint seemed really lenient\""]
["10:35,760","10:43,340","\"Oh, who's this? How'd you get here? They caught me last night, but I escaped. How'd you do that? Don't worry about it\""]
["10:43,340","10:46,600","\"Funny rabbit remember just like me\""]
["10:46,600","10:50,840","\"I jumped very high and my ears were really big\""]
["10:50,840","10:57,840","\"Oops, you're gonna like this part Julian. Are there ghosts better do a flopsy\""]
["10:57,840","11:01,980","\"Hey, oh my gosh wait. No, not that\""]
["11:01,980","11:07,260","\"Life he continues to live this building school after such daring big it is\""]
["11:07,260","11:09,360","\"Life finds a way\""]
["11:09,360","11:15,000","\"See all the rabbits are little slaves being controlled by you kick these over that would be actually really cool, but no\""]
["11:15,000","11:25,160","\"Hello, it's all wrapped it's block man. Is that a literal block man or is that a guy with the thing?\""]
["11:25,160","11:27,160","\"That's a worker\""]
["11:27,160","11:33,940","\"I think it would be fun. He's the resident block man. It'd be cool if there was there's I mean there's animals like what else is there?\""]
["11:33,940","11:39,080","\"I don't know shit. Watch this. I only just been introduced to this world. Oh shit. Oh\""]
["11:39,080","11:47,520","\"It just happened if there's one thing I wish they would change about throwing stuff is that I wish they let you aim at yourself\""]
["11:47,520","11:50,440","\"It just automatically goes to where they're walking oh\""]
["11:53,240","11:56,820","\"You think you would hit them though if you had a aim it manually it seems like it'd be really\""]
["11:56,820","12:00,660","\"I never had a chance. That's just a little more skill. I would be willing to learn, you know\""]
["12:00,660","12:09,020","\"He's stuck in the stairs stop I'm dead where to go\""]
