["14:57,020","15:03,660","\"How would you feel if there was a whole stage where you just have to roll down the whole wooden paths?\""]
["15:03,660","15:06,860","\"I kind of wish there was more platforming like that in this.\""]
["15:06,860","15:08,860","\"Yeah, no, the platforming is honestly the best part.\""]
["15:08,860","15:10,860","\"I'd say so. This shit is cool.\""]
["15:10,860","15:12,220","\"I like the movement controls.\""]

["15:14,380","15:14,860","\"That's something.\""]
["15:14,860","15:16,460","\"It's only the wall jumping that's a little weird.\""]
["15:16,460","15:18,060","\"Everything else feels pretty good with the movement.\""]

["15:38,020","15:42,940","\"Somebody just bounced into their camp and kicked one in the head.\""]

["16:06,240","16:09,540","\"That's that's why he can't wield away.\""]
["16:09,540","16:13,840","\"At least he's not going to die or would he are you going to die?\""]
["16:13,840","16:15,040","\"Chris, if you fall from here.\""]
["16:15,040","16:21,940","\"I mean, I guess so.\""]
["16:22,940","16:24,860","\"That's good though, it means he gets a respawn.\""]
["16:24,860","16:25,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["16:25,360","16:26,200","\"I was just wondering.\""]

["17:39,400","17:46,340","\"That's another thing. Uh, I feel like if you're running at an enemy like really fast and you do that kick move\""]
["17:46,340","17:50,380","\"It kills them easier because of the speed you've got yeah, so that like takes a\""]
["17:51,220","17:57,520","\"the two that's really cool for that you get a role your tomb in your time to\""]
["17:57,520","18:00,120","\"a long now\""]
