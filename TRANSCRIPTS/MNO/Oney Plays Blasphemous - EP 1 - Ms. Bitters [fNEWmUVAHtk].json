["02:14,720","02:15,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:15,580","02:18,880","\"I think I beat him the first time I went up against him, so if I-\""]

["03:24,540","03:25,580","\"if you want me to do that\""]
["03:25,580","03:27,660","\"as opposed to like waiting for him to say all this shit.\""]

["04:16,700","04:23,180","\"If he just told me but I know what they are they're not bells. Oh leave that guy well. He wasn't doing anything. He was fucking just\""]
["04:23,180","04:31,540","\"Offensive to the site. Okay, holding paper and I've seen if I could counter him, but I don't think yeah, he's kind of a dick\""]

["05:57,980","05:59,920","\"We made popsicle sticks stage coaches\""]
["05:59,920","06:01,460","\"and learned all about stage coaches.\""]
["06:01,460","06:03,700","\"It was not even that era of history.\""]

["06:42,220","06:44,460","\"- It's not Charlie Chan in the Chan clan, is it?\""]
["06:44,460","06:47,060","\"- No, I don't think so, but Charlie Chan is a white guy.\""]
["06:47,060","06:48,900","\"- Do you mean to tell me you've never been surprised\""]
["06:48,900","06:50,140","\"in your life?\""]

["07:07,500","07:10,820","\"And I had Rograt's Empower us on PS1.\""]
["07:10,820","07:13,860","\"And there's a mini game in that game called Chuck E. Chan.\""]
["07:13,860","07:16,780","\"And I went into school and I told him about Chuck E. Chan.\""]
["07:16,780","07:18,620","\"And then I didn't think about it anymore.\""]
["07:18,620","07:20,180","\"And then the next day I came in,\""]
["07:20,180","07:22,980","\"he was drawing like fucking hundreds of like versions\""]
["07:22,980","07:25,660","\"of Chuck E. Chan, even though he had never played the game.\""]
["07:25,660","07:27,060","\"He was drawing, he was drawing like Chuck E. Chan\""]

["08:09,900","08:13,940","\"Yeah, the art style is definitely the best thing this game I was going for it.\""]
["08:13,940","08:16,580","\"Yeah, just look at that big thing.\""]

["13:38,820","13:41,840","\"Wow, that's that guy's pretty cool. Yeah, wow\""]
["13:41,840","13:47,440","\"It's bold to make a broad generalization like that about something that's been in games since games\""]

["13:53,120","13:58,820","\"I can somewhat agree though. You know why spikes. Yeah, the actual mechanic itself of dying when touching something\""]
["13:58,820","14:05,720","\"That's all a spike is but it is better to like come up with something that is more original like like or something that suits the area\""]
["14:05,720","14:10,720","\"Yeah, I don't know how I feel about like especially in a game like this where you've got like a health bar and stuff like that\""]

["14:14,620","14:21,440","\"I think it's fine. Yeah, if it if it like you know like it's aesthetically tells you better not fucking touch this\""]
["14:21,440","14:24,420","\"So you're gonna die. It's one thing if it's like Mario or something\""]
["14:24,420","14:27,260","\"Or it's like you die in two hits anyway. I\""]
["14:28,180","14:34,740","\"Don't know it adds a little bit of tension to the platform right I think you got a really fuck up for a mechanic like that to be cool\""]
["14:34,740","14:37,240","\"I don't like it playing games without any tension\""]
["14:37,240","14:41,320","\"So if you're jumping over a spike and you fall on it and you don't die. It's like oh, I guess yeah\""]
["14:41,320","14:44,080","\"It's not like they like come at you or something. They're just there\""]
["14:44,080","14:47,920","\"So you have plenty of time to sort of course correct and not fall into the spikes\""]
["14:47,920","14:53,760","\"Yeah, and it's not like there's much of a punishment if you die, right? Yeah in this game\""]
["14:54,240","14:57,760","\"You don't even take your like salt was when you die in this game\""]
["14:57,760","15:02,700","\"No, but they make you get less of them and they also they take your magic bar thing\""]
["15:02,700","15:05,340","\"And you can you can like pray to a guy to get it back\""]
["15:05,340","15:11,120","\"Which cost souls so they kind of do and don't okay another guy with another do you?\""]
["15:11,120","15:16,100","\"Dear Lord am I right dearie me?\""]
["15:16,100","15:22,040","\"Yeah, there's like a little a little feller on top of that thing oh\""]

["15:45,520","15:50,960","\"I guess I guess we're kind of pulling it back. It's an out-of-order story. I suppose it's like a movie\""]

["15:55,700","15:59,640","\"I didn't have a pencil and she she fucking like\""]
["15:59,640","16:03,920","\"Got up all on my face and started like berating me because that's just what she did\""]

["16:07,680","16:10,780","\"Okay, you got any way that she got up in my face\""]
["16:10,780","16:13,360","\"And she started being like she's yeah\""]
["16:13,360","16:15,360","\"You're never gonna have a future\""]
["16:15,840","16:20,480","\"And then she was like, I'll let you use my tent my pencil because I'm so nice\""]
["16:20,480","16:23,940","\"But you're not allowed to sharpen it and you're not allowed to back\""]
["16:23,940","16:30,140","\"So I just I fucking like broke the pencil in half and I like I like screamed at her. I like custer out\""]
["16:30,140","16:31,960","\"I'm sure it wasn't like articulate\""]
["16:31,960","16:38,200","\"But I put together like like an angry video game nerd kind of string of like you fuck bitch hell bastard\""]
["16:38,200","16:42,320","\"Like I just fucking like threw like every swear word I knew at her. Yeah, and then um\""]
["16:42,320","16:45,120","\"fucking the next year\""]
["16:45,120","16:51,400","\"My fifth grade teacher like pulls me aside after class like the first day of the year and\""]

["16:57,560","17:04,160","\"She's got the pencil in like a little baggy like it's evidence this bitch had saved this pencil\""]
["17:04,160","17:10,120","\"Like up until the next school year to like give to my fifth grade teacher\""]
["17:10,120","17:15,040","\"Which means she had to like look into it like after I got assigned my fifth grade teacher\""]
["17:15,040","17:19,900","\"And she retired between those years. So this fucking psycho bitch like\""]
["17:19,900","17:26,200","\"Stuck around just to make sure that she could like fucking like snitch on me to my fifth grade teacher\""]
["17:26,200","17:27,640","\"And maybe get me on her bad side\""]

["20:44,660","20:49,020","\"You can recover your little yeah, you get all your shit back\""]
["20:49,020","20:50,900","\"Okay, if you get back to it\""]
["20:50,900","20:54,820","\"So it's kind of like it actually is probably like less consequences than Dark Souls\""]
