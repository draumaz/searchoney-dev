["14:29,960","14:36,220","\"Call like you would mean to somebody. Oh, no, she was it was because I called them a spastic\""]
["14:36,220","14:39,060","\"Apparently that's like a defensive word. It is it's like called someone or well\""]
["14:39,060","14:40,340","\"No, I mean that makes sense\""]
["14:40,340","14:44,180","\"But the way that you phrase it sounds like she was just mad at you for calling somebody a name\""]
["14:44,180","14:50,340","\"Using the specific it was funny cuz he was like screaming in my face. How'd you like it if I called you a spastic?\""]

["15:05,620","15:09,620","\"There there's a new cover for it because I think I was right about the old cover\""]
["15:09,620","15:13,620","\"Which is why they changed it. Yeah, but the old cover and this\""]
["15:13,620","15:16,740","\"By the way, I'll start this off with a different story\""]
["15:16,740","15:21,860","\"My grandparents were afraid of black people because we lived in Ohio and everybody there's racist\""]

["15:55,100","15:57,500","\"and it was called Stories Julian Tells.\""]
["15:57,500","15:59,180","\"- Oh, I read that book too.\""]
["15:59,180","16:00,860","\"And the cover, it's like, wasn't the meeting pudding?\""]

["16:16,420","16:17,780","\"That's how they drew it.\""]
["16:17,780","16:19,620","\"And surely enough, like 10 years later,\""]
["16:19,620","16:26,780","\"They changed the cover because I think they recognized oh my the art on the cover looks like they exaggerated it for the sake of being offensive\""]
["16:26,780","16:35,740","\"And little stupid me. I didn't I I'm a dumb little kid. Well, that's who's reading the book to begin with totally remember that book all the sudden\""]
