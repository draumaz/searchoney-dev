["04:15,400","04:22,960","\"He uh in a very quick moment because uh Batman Beyond Bruce Wayne is\""]
["04:22,960","04:28,760","\"instructing a new Batman. Yeah, because he's such a super detective just immediately. He says oh\""]
["04:28,760","04:32,120","\"They probably have a keyword that shuts them down or something\""]
["04:32,120","04:37,760","\"What and there's they have a very awkward conversation earlier where he says\""]
["04:38,960","04:44,560","\"This was my old girlfriend. She's in front of a moon her name's April like April moon like that's wrong\""]
["04:44,560","04:51,820","\"Like that that's seriously what he ends up saying Chris made a really funny face and that that's that's what happens is they\""]

["04:54,760","05:00,560","\"He he seriously just immediately jumps to that conclusion and said oh April moon like a song and\""]
["05:00,560","05:05,420","\"Then he tells him that so at the end of the episode when all of them show again\""]
["05:05,420","05:09,100","\"And his plan the whole episode by the way is just fighting these guys and losing every\""]
["05:09,100","05:10,100","\"time he fights them.\""]
["05:10,100","05:11,620","\"He doesn't try anything different.\""]
["05:11,620","05:12,620","\"Why?\""]

["05:15,620","05:17,420","\"And they all shut down.\""]
["05:17,420","05:18,420","\"Wow.\""]

["05:22,820","05:23,820","\"I assume so.\""]
["05:23,820","05:24,820","\"Weird.\""]
["05:24,820","05:25,820","\"Maybe not.\""]
["05:25,820","05:26,820","\"I don't know.\""]

["05:29,740","05:35,140","\"People hold it up pretty highly but that was not a good episode to watch.\""]
["05:35,140","05:41,000","\"I remember there being better episodes, but at the same time I\""]
["05:41,000","05:45,420","\"Was young when I watched it, so I don't know you have to watch more of it\""]
["05:45,420","05:52,420","\"I should have switched out. I'm sorry. You're not switch out once you start this no. Oh, that's really dumb\""]

["06:56,840","07:01,400","\"It's true. I don't know. Julian's not that common a name is it for brown people it is\""]
["07:01,400","07:08,260","\"This was an awful idea. I didn't know it does I mean I forgot it does that I remember though\""]
["07:08,260","07:12,920","\"I didn't I thought it would be five turns max. No is that what it does is in later games?\""]
["07:12,920","07:16,900","\"Do they ever change it? I think they changed in later games. It's a gen one thing I think\""]

["07:24,040","07:27,760","\"Wait, it said you want to keep using him. Yeah, I could have switched out\""]
["07:27,760","07:31,460","\"I'm doing it because I thought he was gonna do no damage\""]
["07:31,460","07:39,600","\"How come nobody can do is it did he get the stats of the poke then why did he win against the other on X?\""]
["07:39,600","07:47,140","\"I don't know. Why are you hitting this little baby? Can't just go look sad. It looks like he's crying. Can't just go look so happy though\""]

["08:03,880","08:06,000","\"20 inches.\""]
["08:06,000","08:13,440","\"Because I remember a general trend in the Pokemon anime was to drive them a lot bigger than they actually are in the game.\""]
["08:13,440","08:20,440","\"Well, that's not true. The sizes are just all sorts of fucked up because Mewtwo is just person-sized in the anime.\""]
["08:20,680","08:25,960","\"Easy enormous in the games. Is he yeah? Yeah, they they go crazy with the sizes\""]
