["00:11,000","00:16,000","\"Yeah, we were playing Rocket League constantly and laughing at people's faces whenever we scored goals.\""]
["00:16,000","00:17,000","\"It's 'cause they would get mad.\""]
["00:17,000","00:19,000","\"They would always get to wear a yes.\""]

["00:21,000","00:25,000","\"If they can run with a joke, it's great, but in Rocket League, people will get really mad.\""]
["00:25,000","00:26,000","\"It's 'cause it's super competitive.\""]

["00:43,920","00:47,480","\"We would play it back really slow and just start making fake laugh.\""]
["00:47,480","00:51,720","\"It goes, and they go, \"\"Fuck you! Fuck you!\"\"\""]
["00:51,720","00:53,720","\"You fucking suck!\""]

["05:04,340","05:05,760","\"It was trending and shit\""]
["05:05,760","05:10,080","\"I know it was but it's because a lot of artists who are still attached to new grounds were pushing for it\""]
["05:10,080","05:15,920","\"I also saw a lot of people just fighting back because of the reputation it has so I don't know if everyone's gonna massively\""]

["06:16,500","06:21,820","\"I don't know that's I guess that because that that attitude prevents people from learning new things\""]
["06:21,900","06:26,960","\"Yeah, but I start like it's but they don't want to learn new things anyway\""]
["06:26,960","06:31,200","\"I wouldn't care if they went over my big thing with this old tumbler thing has just been okay\""]
["06:31,200","06:36,360","\"Hey, remember how they were promising you that they were gonna be like this this beacon for all of you\""]
["06:36,360","06:39,240","\"Well, that's the thing that makes me upset about the whole thing\""]
["06:39,240","06:44,360","\"I it really gets up my butt when my butt when when anybody claims to like oh\""]
["06:44,360","06:47,840","\"I'm here to be righteous and just about the world and then you find out\""]
["06:47,840","06:52,520","\"Oh no, they only did it because money they wanted people to like them. They wanted to get money out of it\""]
["06:52,520","06:57,600","\"And it worked that kind of thing always makes me really really mad. Well what bums me out about it\""]
["06:57,600","07:00,240","\"I don't like doing the whole I told you so thing\""]
["07:00,240","07:03,040","\"But it's like I've been saying this about Tom's for a really long time\""]
["07:03,040","07:08,580","\"But simply why why was it the one that people adopted for our galleries because it was not structured\""]
["07:08,580","07:15,560","\"Never worked it's so bad for people only went there because everyone else did and that's what I'm worried about and\""]
["07:15,920","07:20,360","\"The fact that I'm reason my voice and doing silly George Costanza that means I should shut up\""]
["07:20,360","07:22,240","\"But like well, it's true though\""]
["07:22,240","07:27,760","\"It is frustrating that that was the website that also everyone adopted when it didn't even function that well to begin with\""]
["07:27,760","07:30,640","\"Specifically artists because if you want to get your art exposed\""]
["07:30,640","07:37,680","\"There are actual art websites that were good for that like proper gallery layouts and everything and people adopted the one that didn't really work\""]
["07:37,680","07:39,240","\"Mm-hmm. It felt like to me\""]
["07:39,240","07:41,520","\"They did it because it was a like a broader audience\""]
["07:41,520","07:47,800","\"I guess they thought they were hitting but all that meant was you're usually more and more buried and you're only gonna be relevant within your own circle\""]
["07:47,800","07:50,980","\"By a read so I don't know where they're gonna switch from Tumblr\""]
["07:50,980","07:53,480","\"I feel like just Twitter for now, but then that's gonna go\""]
["07:53,480","08:00,480","\"Yeah, no well also Twitter just doesn't work for art either people just want to see dumb joke posts\""]
["08:00,480","08:04,160","\"They don't want to see art because it's the most efficient way to get\""]
["08:04,160","08:10,320","\"So Twitter and Tumblr were very efficient at like making you like watch your numbers go up\""]
["08:10,320","08:16,320","\"Yeah, so it should be like I'm getting a lot of likes. I'm getting a lot of followers people like the timeline format - exactly\""]
["08:16,320","08:22,920","\"Well, because it's like this constant fear of making you feel better about yourself and I don't think it's a good idea either way\""]
["08:22,920","08:26,820","\"What are you are you prepared for the opposite of resolution?\""]
["08:26,820","08:29,040","\"Deresolution\""]
["08:29,040","08:34,440","\"But see that also means how do you I do like that we're having all this internet talk while in the Tron level\""]
["08:34,440","08:36,780","\"It's it's fitting. It's fitting\""]
["08:38,680","08:43,060","\"Chris why is it took spin about Julian got to hear this for me\""]
["08:43,060","08:48,440","\"It's really embarrassing I was programming it and I referred to something as resing and I felt like a moron\""]
["08:48,440","08:55,840","\"Because that's a Tron term really I started saying it for the worst reason do you know why tell me why when I when I was doing\""]
["08:55,840","09:01,660","\"Business work on second life for a year the official coding language refers to thing with Tron terminology\""]
["09:01,920","09:06,120","\"Does it really do you spawn an object you have to refer to it as resing an object\""]
["09:06,120","09:11,260","\"Oh, so I started picking up on Tron terminology because of that. That's cool. I like that they do that\""]
["09:11,260","09:15,040","\"It's kind of cool to see it actually like seep into something\""]
["09:15,040","09:20,660","\"I was gonna it was thinking Chris about how you said you don't like Tron right because it's the boring great people\""]
["09:20,660","09:26,000","\"That's your main problem with it. I mean I like that. It's a unique look, but yeah\""]
["09:26,000","09:31,600","\"I don't like if you ignore the human characters and you just look at like the backgrounds\""]
["09:31,600","09:38,480","\"Is that with that increase like the fun big red robots flying around honestly doing anything for you there?\""]
["09:38,480","09:41,680","\"I mean, I have a fascination with like\""]
["09:41,680","09:48,000","\"Like microchips like I like the way they look and I feel like Tron looks like a lot of it is microchip\""]
["09:48,000","09:53,360","\"You looking so I like it, but it's just like just the colors in the movie. Just boring\""]
["09:53,360","10:00,640","\"That's fair. I was just curious. I am not trying to convince you either way when I was really like when I was five\""]
["10:00,640","10:06,800","\"I was I think this visual is cool. That is cool. Not that specifically, but in the movie. I think he looks neat\""]
["10:06,800","10:09,400","\"He does I really am alive when I was five\""]
["10:09,400","10:13,840","\"I used to ask my dad's friend to bring over microchips because I was obsessed with them and they're cool\""]
["10:13,840","10:17,520","\"They'd naturally look like a little city. Yeah, I really like them for some reason\""]
["10:17,520","10:22,560","\"But he never did he was an asshole. Do you have to fight the mad clown posse? I?\""]
