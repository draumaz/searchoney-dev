["03:22,700","03:25,060","\"and\""]
["03:25,060","03:31,060","\"This fucking dude came up to us and he just started he just started inviting us to go shooting with him out of nowhere\""]
["03:31,060","03:33,680","\"and I\""]
["03:33,680","03:36,520","\"Eventually left a conversation because it was it was weird\""]
["03:36,520","03:43,640","\"But Kyle got stuck in it and I was talking to somebody else and he was like is your friend still talking to that guy that you said\""]
["03:43,640","03:45,240","\"at the beginning of the conversation,\""]
["03:45,240","03:46,460","\"hey, I'm avoiding that guy\""]
["03:46,460","03:48,460","\"'cause he keeps talking about his gun.\""]
["03:48,460","03:50,820","\"And I was like, oh yeah, he's still in that conversation,\""]
["03:50,820","03:52,180","\"but I thought it was funny\""]
["03:52,180","03:54,900","\"'cause Kyle needs to learn how to stop talking to people.\""]
["03:54,900","03:56,240","\"So I just kinda left him there\""]
["03:56,240","03:58,460","\"'cause I was gonna save him eventually,\""]
["03:58,460","03:59,420","\"but he did get out of it.\""]
["03:59,420","04:01,100","\"- You wanted to teach him and to fish.\""]
["04:01,100","04:02,180","\"- Yeah, exactly.\""]
["04:02,180","04:06,740","\"But Kyle got a message from the guy\""]
["04:06,740","04:11,260","\"on I think it was LinkedIn inviting him to go shooting\""]
["04:11,260","04:13,340","\"and we were very tempted to do it.\""]
["04:13,340","04:16,100","\"We're like, if we get into this scenario,\""]
["04:16,100","04:20,500","\"we're gonna have a story that involves this weird man\""]
["04:20,500","04:24,660","\"that found Kyle on LinkedIn and a live weapon.\""]
["04:24,660","04:27,340","\"And if we live through that, it's gonna be interesting,\""]
["04:27,340","04:28,420","\"you know?\""]
["04:28,420","04:30,740","\"But we didn't do it 'cause it was like this morning\""]
["04:30,740","04:33,760","\"and he literally messaged Kyle like last night.\""]
["04:33,760","04:38,060","\"So, we missed a gun scenario with a guy.\""]
["04:38,060","04:40,020","\"But to be fair, it seemed like he was in\""]
["04:40,020","04:44,740","\"multi-level marketing because on his LinkedIn profile that explains the\""]
["04:44,740","04:51,420","\"aggressiveness and him just being a loathsome human being basically cuz on his on his LinkedIn profile\""]
["04:51,420","04:57,260","\"He basically like anytime you can't distinguish what somebody's job is or what a business does\""]
["04:57,260","05:03,260","\"It's usually like a multi-level marketing thing like anytime. It's like oh this we're the business of relations and\""]
["05:03,260","05:06,100","\"and marketing\""]
["05:06,100","05:09,780","\"So this guy's job title was like I'm the CEO and\""]
["05:09,780","05:17,060","\"CFO trainer of the business division marketing and that that was like all it said and he was like\""]
["05:17,060","05:19,720","\"Oh, yeah, we're gonna go shooting with some other CEOs\""]
["05:19,720","05:25,740","\"So I guarantee you it's like a multi-level marketing. Yeah, everybody calls themselves CEOs\""]
["05:25,740","05:28,700","\"Yes, you technically can\""]
["05:28,700","05:34,980","\"Even if it's just a one-man small business. It's just a bunch of fucking like business jargon\""]
["05:34,980","05:42,720","\"I've actually saved Kyle from some multi-level marketing shit in the past because before he started editing for for\""]
["05:42,720","05:44,720","\"Ownie plays and\""]
["05:44,720","05:50,300","\"Yeah, it's isn't he great you almost forget he's there anyway\""]
["05:50,300","05:55,820","\"though\""]
["05:55,820","06:01,220","\"Kyle was looking for jobs on like monster and and shit like that\""]
["06:01,220","06:07,260","\"You know that the job hunting websites and yeah, he would keep going to these places that were\""]
["06:07,260","06:10,740","\"vaguely described and then um\""]
["06:10,740","06:13,580","\"They would just be fucking multi-level marketing schemes\""]
["06:13,580","06:18,700","\"But one of them like drove him to a different city and they were like okay. What your job is\""]
["06:18,700","06:24,740","\"Is we go to people's houses and we ask if they have AT&T and\""]
["06:24,740","06:27,540","\"basically if if they just uh\""]
["06:29,540","06:35,560","\"Basically what they do is that if you say yes, then they call AT&T and try to put you on like their family plan\""]
["06:35,560","06:39,660","\"Basically and like shave money off the top. Yeah, this is basically all they try to do\""]
["06:39,660","06:44,240","\"That's fucking creepy. But yeah, basically basically\""]
["06:44,240","06:49,620","\"They were like oh we're gonna go to our other office and they just put Kyle in the back of a van and drove him to another city\""]
["06:49,620","06:51,620","\"And we're like okay. This is what we're doing now\""]
["06:51,620","06:55,820","\"So he like called me and I like drove out there and rescue him\""]
["06:56,340","07:00,020","\"Then my then my fucking car blew up. How did that happen?\""]
["07:00,020","07:04,100","\"Oh, it was it was already gonna blow up, but that was like that last voyage of the car\""]
["07:04,100","07:07,580","\"It feels like you're trying to pour on a little extra guilt here of Kyle\""]
["07:07,580","07:15,580","\"Dude this game is awesome. Yeah, it's really cool\""]
["07:15,580","07:20,300","\"Sorry I was talking about multi-level marketing over this it looks actually like a lot of fun\""]
["07:20,300","07:22,300","\"I I I I'm sort of\""]
["07:22,820","07:27,600","\"into the whole MLM because I don't know I have a thing with charlatans and just like\""]
["07:27,600","07:31,360","\"fraud and fakes in general what I love hearing stories about\""]
["07:31,360","07:34,720","\"Any sort of like failure on the part of those people\""]
["07:34,720","07:38,280","\"So the fact that you rescued one person from it\""]
["07:38,280","07:40,480","\"Makes me happy\""]
["07:40,480","07:46,420","\"Yeah, do you have any good multi-level marketing fraud stories? I don't think I have any good ones of my own\""]
["07:46,420","07:49,120","\"any second-hand ones\""]
["07:49,120","07:51,820","\"yeah, but I\""]
["07:52,360","07:55,160","\"Don't know if I want to go into it. Oh, yeah\""]
["07:55,160","07:58,040","\"Because it's like at least\""]
["07:58,040","08:03,960","\"Most of the people involved in them are public figures. Okay. All right. It's not that I\""]
["08:03,960","08:08,960","\"Actually do like leaving that vague. Oh, no\""]
["08:08,960","08:15,040","\"Dude, sorry that I'm not talking to allies usually when I get into a game like this and like wow\""]
["08:15,040","08:17,560","\"Yeah, Chris is on what we call the gamers edge\""]
["08:18,040","08:24,520","\"You know what else I'll say one if if you don't mind we keep going on about multi-level marketing\""]
["08:24,520","08:29,280","\"So I'm not gonna say what the product is or who the people are\""]
["08:29,280","08:37,200","\"Also the product is fuck it. So for some reason in the voice acting industry\""]
["08:37,200","08:44,200","\"Yeah, there's a bunch of people who are really into selling this one like it's basically like anti-aging cream\""]
["08:44,200","08:47,080","\"So it's you know, it's snake oil\""]
["08:47,080","08:47,920","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:47,920","08:50,840","\"But it turns out what it really is,\""]
["08:50,840","08:53,120","\"is it's an extract from some kind of cactus\""]
["08:53,120","08:54,960","\"that's mildly poisonous,\""]
["08:54,960","08:58,000","\"and the reason it makes people's wrinkles disappear,\""]
["08:58,000","08:58,920","\"at least initially,\""]
["08:58,920","09:01,400","\"is because it causes your skin to swell\""]
["09:01,400","09:02,960","\"from an allergic reaction.\""]
["09:02,960","09:04,360","\"- Yeah, that's like the Instagram thing,\""]
["09:04,360","09:05,720","\"there was like the poop tea,\""]
["09:05,720","09:07,800","\"that makes you like shit your fucking guts out.\""]
["09:07,800","09:10,400","\"It's like a weight loss tea,\""]
["09:10,400","09:13,040","\"and basically it's just a laxative.\""]
["09:13,040","09:15,840","\"But I don't know why you got a lie about that.\""]
["09:15,840","09:18,060","\"I mean, like, isn't it compelling enough\""]
["09:18,060","09:20,380","\"just to have like a big, watery shit\""]
["09:20,380","09:22,460","\"that just like, evacuates your pals?\""]
["09:22,460","09:23,960","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:23,960","09:25,260","\"- Isn't that enough?\""]
["09:25,260","09:26,460","\"- Why not sell this? - Well, I just sell this.\""]
["09:26,460","09:27,760","\"- Well, it's a little lax. - Yeah.\""]
["09:27,760","09:29,540","\"- So it is a good time.\""]
["09:29,540","09:31,540","\"Sell it as a fun Tuesday night, you know?\""]
["09:31,540","09:34,460","\"- But I think you still have to make it sound like unique\""]
["09:34,460","09:35,860","\"'cause otherwise people will just be like,\""]
["09:35,860","09:36,760","\"\"\"Oh, that's a good idea.\""]
["09:36,760","09:39,440","\"I'll just buy a cheaper over-the-counter laxative\""]
["09:39,440","09:40,980","\"instead of your stupid thing.\"\"\""]
["09:40,980","09:42,220","\"- No, but it would be like it.\""]
["09:42,220","09:44,580","\"Okay, so like, here's the thing, right?\""]
["09:44,580","09:47,880","\"You've got attractive people on Instagram willing to show this, right?\""]
["09:47,880","09:54,000","\"I mean, like I feel like there's a market for that like oh don't you want to don't you want to imagine a lady like me?\""]
["09:54,000","09:57,180","\"Yeah, don't you want to imagine a lady like me fucking\""]
["09:57,180","10:02,260","\"projectile blasting shit in the back walls of my toilet like yes\""]
["10:02,260","10:06,280","\"I absolutely do I'll buy that product just to have the mental image. You know what I'm saying?\""]
["10:06,280","10:11,140","\"Look see this is this is freaking sweet Lois\""]
["10:12,660","10:16,220","\"Well, I guess I can't go in there. Oh, I can't.\""]
["10:16,220","10:16,740","\"Manidea.\""]
["10:16,740","10:27,460","\"Is it weird to me that hearing a family guy line without the silly voice was just funny to me because I've heard with the silly voice like so many fucking times that it...\""]
["10:27,460","10:28,460","\"*gasp*\""]
["10:28,460","10:30,740","\"Wait, which family guy voice?\""]
["10:30,740","10:33,700","\"He just said, he just said, uh, that's freaking sweet low, isn't it?\""]
["10:33,700","10:36,140","\"I like genuinely laughed at it.\""]
["10:36,140","10:48,900","\"And then I realized the only reason why anybody thought that that was funny in the first place is because of the Peter Griffin voice, but now it's gone so far around that it's funny to not have it.\""]
["10:48,900","10:52,140","\"I got a split kill.\""]
["10:52,140","10:54,740","\"I feel very powerful right now.\""]
["10:54,740","10:57,420","\"So how do you shoot in two different directions? Is that both sticks?\""]
["10:57,420","11:00,820","\"You hold on left trigger and then you'll just aim left. It seems.\""]
["11:00,820","11:02,380","\"Oh, need to remember with that one.\""]
["11:02,380","11:03,100","\"All right.\""]
["11:03,100","11:05,060","\"Yeah, but I'll do.\""]
["11:05,060","11:09,060","\"So basically you just have an offhand that always shoots in the same direction\""]
["11:09,060","11:13,840","\"Make an offhand comment that makes him kill himself. You make an offhand comment that might even have some tracky\""]
["11:13,840","11:18,860","\"Oh, there's lots of tracking going on. Yeah, but it's fine. It's fun\""]
["11:18,860","11:22,420","\"Cool\""]
["11:22,420","11:26,140","\"You know that's true that is kind of cool. That is pretty rataroonie. Look at him dance\""]
["11:26,140","11:30,900","\"This is like hotel Miami music\""]
["11:32,660","11:36,060","\"Oh, it's better we should just make hotel my\""]
["11:36,060","11:41,780","\"Thinking of hotel Mario. I can't tell if this is blocking me or is that okay?\""]
["11:41,780","11:45,940","\"I think the boxes are but now they have an angle on you. Yeah. Oh\""]
["11:45,940","11:51,820","\"No, no, no, see that's so scary. It's a good metaphor for if you put your shit off to late. Oh\""]
["11:51,820","12:01,660","\"Oh\""]

["19:37,780","19:38,620","\"- Okay.\""]

["19:57,740","19:59,380","\"Yeah, well, okay.\""]
["19:59,380","20:03,260","\"So basically, how many wishes would it take\""]

["20:04,620","20:06,220","\"Can I be an asshole on it, and I'd say--\""]

["20:17,220","20:18,860","\"I've always wondered about the wishing for money\""]

["21:10,080","21:14,480","\"Yeah, I guess you could because that would still take a year off your life. Yeah\""]
["21:17,440","21:21,600","\"Okay, it's a cop, but I won't do it. I won't do it just cuz Tomar said it's a cop out. Thank you\""]

["23:13,280","23:19,240","\"I still have a trouble visualizing. It would be like they don't take it into a smaller size\""]
["23:19,240","23:22,240","\"You look like a weird pin starfish guy\""]
["23:22,240","23:30,480","\"So so like the like his wrist like his whole hand would be the width of his wrist. Yeah, can I still be Jeff Bezos if I?\""]

["24:07,680","24:15,260","\"Yeah, I can't tell right because technically we're like we used to be on all fours gravity would make you think that the direction is up\""]

["24:17,600","24:21,240","\"But the head is like that could conceivably be the base right?\""]
