["18:42,760","18:49,900","\"So maybe I can do it now so the original had a camera like this you can switch back and forth\""]
["18:50,040","18:56,360","\"The original has like a fixed camera and subsistence has like a like your kind of traditional like oh 3d or\""]
["18:56,360","19:01,600","\"Person but I mean like all the metal gears were like kind of like top down and you know\""]
["19:01,600","19:05,920","\"So like if I do that that's kind of how it looked. Why did people not like that?\""]
["19:05,920","19:11,940","\"It's just the camera is like a little weird at some places and it gives you like one singular angle\""]
["19:11,940","19:16,520","\"So if I if I was coming from the other direction this angle would actually like really suck ah\""]
["19:16,520","19:19,160","\"But that's that's how two was\""]
["19:19,160","19:24,900","\"But yeah, I can I guess it makes more sense and to because the areas are more constricted\""]
["19:24,900","19:29,320","\"I mean it does make sense to it because you can kind of see like oh, there's a guy right there\""]
["19:29,320","19:35,040","\"Just whoa, oh god. That was close. Yeah, my camouflage is like 95%\""]
["19:35,040","19:39,640","\"So he's gonna have trouble seeing me, but I he fucking blended in\""]
