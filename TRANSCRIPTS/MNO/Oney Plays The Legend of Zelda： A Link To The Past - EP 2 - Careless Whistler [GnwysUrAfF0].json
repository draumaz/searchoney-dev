["11:25,780","11:30,940","\"That's really a lot of thought. They have to like sacrifice their treasure\""]

["11:34,920","11:40,300","\"That used to be how you won sea voyages is you just arrived on the other side with the most balls\""]
["11:41,100","11:45,920","\"And then if you did that it's like a you ever play graffiti in Tony Hawk\""]
["11:45,920","11:51,260","\"Or it would just mark that territory as yours if you do the best trick on it. Yeah, then someone has to do a better trick\""]
["11:51,260","11:54,380","\"That was how land worked back then simpler times\""]
