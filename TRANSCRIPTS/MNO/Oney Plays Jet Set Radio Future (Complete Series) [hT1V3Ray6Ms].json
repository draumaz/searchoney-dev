["04:03,340","04:04,340","\"Yeah, I thought it was fun.\""]
["04:04,340","04:08,340","\"I think that might be just because the acting weird is the only joke.\""]
["04:08,340","04:11,340","\"And I very much appreciate that kind of thing.\""]

["04:28,700","04:33,260","\"hated is because of the original. The original is good. I feel like they can coexist.\""]
["04:33,260","04:36,060","\"That's good. I just think it can't. One doesn't have to be better than the other.\""]
["04:36,060","04:40,940","\"The kid is really bad. The kid is really is awful but I think I had a discussion with\""]

["04:45,940","04:46,940","\"Why is that?\""]
["04:46,940","04:52,500","\"And his theory was that it's supposed to go into making it feel more dreamlike because\""]
["04:52,500","04:55,100","\"they don't act the way you're supposed to expect them to.\""]
["04:55,100","05:00,740","\"I don't know how I feel about that, but it's an interesting idea.\""]
["05:00,740","05:06,220","\"He definitely does have a preliquivity towards actors that don't act like people should act.\""]
["05:06,220","05:08,940","\"Well, it's done motherfuckers didn't put the bar high enough at the top.\""]

["46:32,020","46:35,660","\"This game ran pretty silky smooth usually.\""]

["47:16,760","47:22,280","\"They set up an emulator. It's in GoldenEye's source code. They had was it ZX spec from I forget what it was\""]
["47:22,280","47:23,880","\"They had an emulator for some PC.\""]
["47:23,880","47:25,040","\"How did they do that?\""]
["47:25,880","47:27,400","\"just by knowing.\""]
["47:27,400","47:29,120","\"- But like, you know what, you don't need to look at\""]
["47:29,120","47:31,520","\"Nintendo 64 on an emulator and all the textures\""]
["47:31,520","47:32,440","\"are really blurry.\""]
["47:32,440","47:35,880","\"Did they have to build a game from the ground up?\""]
["47:35,880","47:37,880","\"- It actually turns out, 'cause the N64,\""]
["47:37,880","47:39,680","\"that was like a key feature that we're bragging about,\""]
["47:39,680","47:41,040","\"I was like, oh, we have this,\""]
["47:41,040","47:42,600","\"that we can blur textures and everything.\""]
["47:42,600","47:44,080","\"Most games would do it.\""]
["47:44,080","47:46,240","\"But people found out that you can turn that off\""]
["47:46,240","47:47,920","\"'cause there's a couple of games\""]
["47:47,920","47:50,680","\"that you have it in the options menu to turn that off.\""]
["47:50,680","47:51,520","\"- Yeah, no, 'cause I can't--\""]
["47:51,520","47:53,160","\"- 'Cause it was better when you turn it off.\""]
["47:53,160","47:54,000","\"- It looked ugly.\""]
["47:54,000","47:56,880","\"Yeah, it always typically looks pretty ugly.\""]

["47:58,280","48:00,040","\"- I didn't know you could turn it off.\""]
["48:00,040","48:01,360","\"- You can turn it off.\""]
["48:01,360","48:04,040","\"And some games people have been finding out\""]
["48:04,040","48:07,440","\"game shark codes, because it's built in every game\""]
["48:07,440","48:08,640","\"in the actual code.\""]
["48:08,640","48:11,000","\"You can disable all of the blurring,\""]
["48:11,000","48:13,760","\"so you just get a pixel-perfect clean.\""]
["48:13,760","48:15,160","\"And by doing that, you get to see two,\""]
["48:15,160","48:17,520","\"there's dithering and everything shading.\""]
["48:17,520","48:19,920","\"So, games run better if you do that,\""]
["48:19,920","48:21,640","\"and also they look a lot cleaner.\""]
["48:21,640","48:22,480","\"- This is crazy.\""]
["48:22,480","48:26,480","\"Because every time I emulated a game I never saw a game that didn't use that.\""]
