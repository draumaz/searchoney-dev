["14:40,160","14:46,800","\"But I think that there's they get some sort of thing together to turn him back and then they have to use it to stop the bad guy\""]
["14:46,800","14:51,920","\"Instead, I think that's what happens, but I that might not even be a spoiler\""]
["14:51,920","14:53,920","\"That might be me just kind of filling in\""]
["14:53,920","15:00,240","\"What I would assume it was there was a PSP game where you get to play as Dexter the DAX\""]

["15:51,520","15:54,940","\"Yeah, you could fucking, cause you got a cheat code.\""]
["15:54,940","15:57,500","\"That was a game where you unlocked cheat codes.\""]
["15:57,500","16:03,440","\"And you could get unlimited ammo you could get unlimited darkjack and just fucking like powerbomb civilians. That's fun\""]
["16:03,440","16:09,240","\"Yeah, I remember back in the day the stryol humans was so fun. I'll do destroy all humans. It's great\""]
["16:09,240","16:10,600","\"Yeah, I\""]

["16:53,600","16:59,420","\"That game was a lot of fun, and he sounded like Jack Nicholson. He did that was the best thing about the game\""]
