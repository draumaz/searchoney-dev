["01:16,060","01:22,020","\"Yellow yellow yellow. I think it takes up build was juice though. It's juice. Yeah. Oh look at that\""]
["01:22,020","01:27,480","\"That's like rag doll rag doll bridge physics. You actually dodgy. You can push it down. Whoa you can do a ball ball\""]
["01:27,480","01:31,520","\"Whoa, there's so much shit you can do this is so whoa\""]

["01:43,360","01:48,080","\"You're like a little dragon balls you guy\""]
["01:48,080","01:53,360","\"So this is an ending game of sorts yep\""]
["01:53,360","01:56,920","\"You can tell it has some sonic influence\""]
["01:56,920","02:03,280","\"It really does it just kind of looks like the background it's got a lot of super-to-do influence to just in general\""]
["02:03,280","02:06,920","\"Oh, wow look at different ideas. What a lot of different ideas. Yeah. Yeah, you can dash\""]
["02:06,920","02:09,360","\"Yeah, tough for tough. Like toughly. Oh\""]

["02:30,240","02:33,520","\"They can't do that. Oh wow. Do you see that? Oh?\""]

["02:53,080","02:57,720","\"I'm gonna make a criticism here. Yeah very very wild. I'm making sure for this\""]
["02:57,720","03:01,400","\"I think this game is so unique on its own. I think they need the sonic sound effects\""]
["03:01,400","03:03,240","\"Yeah, they don't need any of the sonic shit\""]
["03:03,240","03:08,560","\"I'm saying if you guys cut you know, maybe that's my little comment there, but it still looks like a great game\""]
["03:08,560","03:10,240","\"It's so unique\""]
["03:10,240","03:12,240","\"You say that as he turns into a fucking son\""]
["03:15,840","03:22,080","\"It's still cool. I'm just saying they can still use that without like having direct references to Sonic\""]
["03:22,080","03:25,720","\"I don't know if I don't know if those side effects were used elsewhere - I'm just saying\""]
["03:25,720","03:29,200","\"Look at this little dash you can do Wow. I\""]
["03:29,200","03:34,160","\"Mean I'm pretty sure there's there's lots of games that have started off as like fan games and they turn them into something\""]
