["00:30,900","00:33,700","\"Ever you can't just say do that again\""]
["00:33,700","00:42,500","\"Yeah, that sounds good the second time, but it's on screen. He's gonna fuck my god\""]
["00:42,500","00:46,680","\"Look it's Tyrannosaurus bone man. He had to yawn\""]
["00:46,680","00:52,220","\"He was bored of this let's play oh\""]
["00:52,220","00:54,860","\"Jurassic nap\""]
["00:54,860","00:58,580","\"Is it well have you ever played this game never?\""]
["00:58,580","01:03,340","\"This was a childhood game and I never beat it. I saw the movie. Well the game's better\""]
["01:03,340","01:10,820","\"Remember when a little girl got done at by those those little screecher things that squeak. Yeah, that's what you play is\""]
["01:10,820","01:17,240","\"Do you get it at by the squeakers? That's the compost nag nag this he's made of compost\""]
["01:17,240","01:22,260","\"He's good for the worms see those prints they're fake. I\""]
["01:22,260","01:25,060","\"Don't dare you\""]
["01:25,380","01:30,980","\"You so what all the people that got eaten by dinosaurs are just crisis actors is that what you're saying Chris?\""]
["01:30,980","01:36,220","\"I would say that yes. I've seen them in Starbucks the other day. They're having a little meeting. There's oh my god\""]
["01:36,220","01:41,940","\"You do play as it told you wait. You're the dinosaurs in this game. You're you're the dinosaurs and the humans\""]
["01:41,940","01:45,060","\"This game fucking sucks my dick\""]
["01:45,060","01:50,780","\"Chris is this the game that when you're slaughtering humans the guys like scream bloody murder\""]
["01:51,700","01:58,660","\"They're like fuck it sounds real. It's like real death yeah, I remember this game schemes fucking horrible\""]
["01:58,660","02:06,300","\"You get to eat the dinosaurs though. It looks like really weird and jerky. Does that do anything for you? Oh it controls like ass\""]
["02:06,300","02:10,580","\"It's awful. Yeah, it doesn't look like this is\""]
["02:10,580","02:14,820","\"But you get to play the dinosaur. That's always fun\""]
["02:14,820","02:19,860","\"I'm sure that like if I got this as the kid I'd probably think that was pretty cool\""]
["02:19,860","02:20,860","\"I love it.\""]
["02:20,860","02:24,100","\"You play the dinosaur, but can only move in two dimensions like a retired dinosaur?\""]
["02:24,100","02:25,100","\"No!\""]
["02:25,100","02:26,100","\"What the fuck are you talking about?\""]
["02:26,100","02:27,100","\"It's a video game!\""]
["02:27,100","02:30,300","\"Also, dinosaurs do only exist in two dimensions.\""]
["02:30,300","02:32,900","\"They didn't invent the third dimension until the 12th century.\""]
["02:32,900","02:35,300","\"Yeah, who invented it?\""]
["02:35,300","02:41,740","\"Mr. Del Flato, which became an ironic name after he invented the third dimension and\""]
["02:41,740","02:45,180","\"he was like, \"\"No, you must call me Roundulus.\"\"\""]
["02:45,180","02:47,860","\"Mr. Del Flato, what are you talking about?\""]
["02:47,860","02:49,820","\"I'm round now!\""]
["02:49,820","02:56,080","\"And then no one believed him. He was he was actually burnt at the stake like Galileo until the world at large\""]
["02:56,080","03:01,800","\"Was ready to accept the third dimension fucking tragic how men of science are so off killed at least they got to watch\""]
["03:01,800","03:08,140","\"At least they had another access to watch his fucking burned murder from this one's a big one more angles\""]
["03:08,140","03:12,060","\"I like the shape of his head. It doesn't looks like the tip of my penor\""]
["03:12,060","03:19,080","\"My dad my perfectly circumcised penor you might have like swollen glands to be honest perfectly circumcised\""]
["03:19,100","03:25,460","\"Dude, whoever whoever cut me did a really good job. It's that was a it's a pretty clean\""]
["03:25,460","03:28,180","\"It's like a perfect like battering. No, oh well\""]
["03:28,180","03:35,260","\"It wasn't confident now. We're back to the beginning. Isn't that fun just like the real dinosaurs when the meteor hit\""]
["03:35,260","03:40,700","\"They all got taken back to the past. I'm not going to change how like only the rats and stuff survived\""]
["03:40,700","03:43,700","\"She for fuck Christ lost half my fucking help ah\""]
["03:44,620","03:48,400","\"I thought that like the fucking sharks and the alligators survived\""]
["03:48,400","03:52,420","\"I mean like you know mammals. I know dinosaurs weren't mammals, but\""]
["03:52,420","03:59,780","\"Like I mean they're they're cold-blooded right so they like you ever had a lizard or known a guy who has a lizard\""]
["03:59,780","04:04,220","\"I had a lizard. I had a pet Gecko. I had a pet Gecko. Yeah, like Chris. Yeah\""]
["04:04,220","04:11,380","\"Because lizards you need like a heatlight and shit to keep them alive. No, you don't they fucking die like that\""]
["04:11,380","04:17,700","\"No, you put him in a like a bitch lizard like put him in a little sock and you hang him over you hang him on the fishing line\""]
["04:17,700","04:24,100","\"Yeah, or you do that but they didn't have socks or heatlights when the ice age came so only shit with like fur\""]
["04:24,100","04:26,180","\"lived yeah\""]
["04:26,180","04:28,860","\"Also like something like a t-rex you would think like\""]
["04:28,860","04:33,780","\"Something like a t-rex would surely survive right because it's big and can kill whatever it wants\""]
["04:33,780","04:39,300","\"But that also means it has to eat more so food becomes scarce big things like fucking starve to death\""]
["04:39,300","04:45,620","\"Did you watch all this on the documentary? No, I mean it's basic common sense shit. Yeah, okay, Lyle\""]
["04:45,620","04:51,540","\"That's why you beat the dinosaurs. I did I killed every last one. There was no meteor. It was me\""]
["04:51,540","04:57,460","\"Now, what were you gonna say about the matter - I called it the me to yours so that everyone would know it was me\""]
["04:57,460","05:02,620","\"But people just didn't pick up on that the Lyle T or I did it. I'd be level one. I should have done called it\""]
["05:02,620","05:05,820","\"Well, if you could name a dinosaur after you, what would it be?\""]
["05:06,420","05:08,420","\"What is my name? Nyle?\""]
["05:08,420","05:12,440","\"Lila Saurus well, I guess that's boring put a\""]
["05:12,440","05:15,580","\"Name it Lyle just Lyle. Yeah\""]
["05:15,580","05:22,780","\"Like I'll just have it take my name like you know how when you get married like technically your your wife would be called\""]
["05:22,780","05:25,740","\"Miss Mrs. Nyle\""]
["05:25,740","05:31,780","\"Who the fuck are you getting a frickin call? Yeah? It's our fucking it's our fucking shitheaded friend\""]
["05:31,780","05:34,260","\"Neil no the other one right here\""]
["05:34,980","05:36,980","\"Are you here?\""]
["05:36,980","05:43,900","\"All right, we are recording right now, and you are ruining it look I'm eating\""]
["05:43,900","05:48,580","\"Raptors welcome up. Oh, so your health goes up when you eat such an uncivilized time\""]
["05:48,580","05:51,660","\"Do you have unlimited shoes of their of their meat?\""]
["05:51,660","05:59,420","\"No, it varies depending on how big they are what you actually fucking like kill them is that little thing yeah\""]
["05:59,420","06:01,900","\"Like well things are fucking bastards their fears\""]
["06:01,900","06:04,980","\"Yeah, they're called later on to the rafters get doors as shields\""]
["06:04,980","06:09,180","\"No, and then you can't get through them because you can't open the door\""]
["06:09,180","06:13,340","\"But then the rafter opens the door and bites you no this is not the movie\""]
["06:13,340","06:18,060","\"This is a game based on the my heard those fuckers are common ancestors with chickens. Yeah\""]
["06:18,060","06:24,700","\"Yeah, those fucking chickens would eat you if they could I heard that they made like a chicken with teeth and then immediately killed it\""]
["06:24,700","06:29,340","\"I don't know just those people\""]
["06:29,420","06:35,140","\"You know those people the science lads. Yeah, they were putting like heads on dogs and stuff\""]
["06:35,140","06:40,960","\"Yeah, they do goofy shit sometimes they just make chickens with teeth and then they go ah\""]
["06:40,960","06:44,260","\"Then they throw it in the garbage\""]
["06:44,260","06:53,980","\"So this little guy its name is a green a source a green a source I'm killing the tooth of source the tooth of source\""]
["06:53,980","06:54,940","\"I\""]
["06:54,940","07:00,580","\"I hate a green with that. That's a rock of source because he lives up here in the rocks. That's easy\""]
["07:00,580","07:05,920","\"You just put any word on to there's a legosaurus there because he has legs, okay?\""]
["07:05,920","07:08,740","\"There's a little armosaurus. Okay. This is a rocket lock of dawn\""]
["07:08,740","07:19,660","\"The dully to the tilapidin then when you kill them they become dead a sore eye\""]
["07:19,660","07:24,260","\"They become bleed a sorase. Yeah, the corpus over dawn\""]
["07:24,260","07:26,260","\"Oh\""]
["07:26,260","07:29,600","\"Stiffosaurus becomes the habeas corpus. Oh\""]
["07:29,600","07:33,020","\"There's a flying one now Jeepers\""]
["07:33,020","07:37,900","\"Whoa did you see through his wings did they have that back then that technology and video?\""]
["07:37,900","07:42,820","\"G of transparent polygons pretty fucking good as impressive\""]
["07:42,820","07:46,340","\"Nighole you need to learn how to make games\""]
["07:46,340","07:49,860","\"Did you see that hey?\""]
["07:49,860","07:52,540","\"Man\""]
["07:52,540","07:55,700","\"What do you think look like are do that are those enemies harder?\""]
["07:55,700","07:59,420","\"Does it get harder as you progress the levels um kind of it's a pet?\""]
["07:59,420","08:03,900","\"It just it depends on what's it in theory. I mean like there's nothing to do with their size\""]
["08:03,900","08:08,340","\"It's just how they move well. How do you move in three dimensions in this 2d platform?\""]
["08:08,340","08:12,740","\"Because it's still on a 2d plane. It's kind of like how he's still flat when he turns like\""]
["08:12,740","08:17,420","\"Yeah, the his tail doesn't animate to follow him. It's just weird\""]
["08:17,420","08:22,060","\"This is a very bizarre game, but not gonna lie. I'm kind of liking it\""]
["08:22,060","08:27,500","\"I fucking oh you will see how shitty it gets it's awful the weird thing these levels aren't bad\""]
["08:27,500","08:33,400","\"But they're not very fun either the weird thing about this game though is like there's no like scorecard or tally or anything\""]
["08:33,400","08:35,920","\"It's like you just you just keep going you've got an eye meter\""]
["08:35,920","08:42,980","\"I like it for that actually that's stuff. I like what is that I in the top right signify it how angry you are\""]
["08:42,980","08:47,220","\"See the more slitter that gets the more anger you get\""]
["08:47,220","08:51,220","\"Yes, that's\""]
["08:51,260","08:54,520","\"No, but Aaron you enter like this rage mode when it gets\""]
["08:54,520","09:01,360","\"Holy shit, no, no, no did that make you matter?\""]
["09:01,360","09:07,900","\"Yeah, okay, we're good a little bit is I yellowed a bit don't fuck it. Oh get out of here. You fucking shit. What is he doing?\""]
["09:07,900","09:10,980","\"Please just fucking end the level come on\""]
["09:10,980","09:13,860","\"No, oh\""]
["09:13,860","09:17,700","\"No, this is fucking shit. This isn't fair\""]
["09:18,580","09:23,060","\"What you have to do jump over these fuck? Oh, yeah, oh you did it right\""]
["09:23,060","09:26,340","\"That the end of that fuck yeah\""]
["09:26,340","09:31,720","\"You know how long do you think we'd survive back then like if we were teleported back there in a time machine?\""]
["09:31,720","09:35,780","\"Cuz I don't think they're I don't think very long. I'd fuck them up. There was fuck them up\""]
["09:35,780","09:42,420","\"I'd fuck them up stinging scorpions back then do everything stung you back then even cockroach. We would have complex diseases\""]
["09:42,420","09:47,020","\"Fuck up everything. Oh, yeah, wouldn't the air kill us like that fucking Tom Cruise movie?\""]
["09:47,020","09:50,900","\"No, it would do the opposite wouldn't it wouldn't we be like super immune to that shit? Probably not\""]
["09:50,900","09:56,140","\"I know there's probably a lot that we've like oh whoa look at it. Look at that. Whoa about that\""]
["09:56,140","09:59,520","\"That's the long leopardly source\""]
["09:59,520","10:06,420","\"Whoa, that's actually pretty neat. It's not it's not fair. You can't predict where their fucking feet are gonna go\""]
["10:06,420","10:12,700","\"Shadows yeah, we'll watch just watch doop doo-doo. Oh, I hope it don't get stepped on oh\""]
["10:13,500","10:17,220","\"Oh, and you didn't oh, okay. Well like there's no way to see it\""]
["10:17,220","10:21,440","\"There's no fucking way and other rocks coming in and look at that look at that. Oh\""]
["10:21,440","10:24,740","\"It's just luck here\""]
["10:24,740","10:31,080","\"Chris did you like Jurassic world no one of the fucking worst movies ever made? Oh\""]
["10:31,080","10:36,700","\"Aren't they making a new Jurassic Park and I think don't they always just say oh my god\""]
["10:36,700","10:38,700","\"I'm bigger done this or this time\""]
["10:38,700","10:42,060","\"Every time's like it's bigger and he's fighting the old one\""]
["10:42,060","10:47,620","\"It doesn't the meteor make an appearance in this one like does it yeah, they get the DNA from the meteor that is\""]
["10:47,620","10:52,700","\"No, no, I mean there is there I think that is the premise of it is no\""]
["10:52,700","10:59,580","\"Island is blown up. It's handsome become the dominant species. What a world we live in look it's just okay. There we go\""]
["10:59,580","11:05,360","\"So you're telling me they clone a meteor yeah, and they fire the meteor become self-aware and then they\""]
["11:07,860","11:11,960","\"And they're like it left and they see the meteor's scratches on the wall\""]
["11:11,960","11:18,380","\"Well, you had me going for a bit because those movies are so bad, but is the meteor a bit real a meteor yet?\""]
["11:18,380","11:21,100","\"I don't know if the meteor is but I know that the island blows up\""]
["11:21,100","11:26,620","\"So in there was a shot of like Chris Pratt running with the dinosaurs and then he jumps off a cliff\""]
["11:26,620","11:29,180","\"And then the dinosaurs all jump off the cliff with him. Oh\""]
["11:29,180","11:33,060","\"What\""]
["11:33,060","11:37,980","\"Fuck that like one shot at you you you can't predict where it's gonna go it makes no sense\""]
["11:37,980","11:42,220","\"You have to literally just do it a hundred times in a row\""]
["11:42,220","11:46,260","\"But guess what after this life there's no more lives and I have to start the whole game again\""]
["11:46,260","11:50,580","\"We like brute force it with like a password or something. Oh totally us exactly what we're gonna do\""]
["11:50,580","11:59,620","\"You're ruining the integrity of let's plays you know that I don't care you know that you know that uh any\""]
["12:00,740","12:06,420","\"Any official guide that shows your speedrunning time on this game they're not gonna count you I\""]
["12:06,420","12:14,880","\"Don't care you know that so few people have speedrunned this game just by beating it legitimately you'd probably rank\""]
["12:14,880","12:16,800","\"That's rude\""]
["12:16,800","12:22,560","\"Ball's anyway like if you ever watch a speedrun. It's just them glitchin through a wall or like glitchin glitchin through shit\""]
["12:22,560","12:26,680","\"It's like it's interesting the first few times you see that stuff and then after a while. I don't know\""]
["12:26,680","12:28,680","\"I remember like- Oh, that's an exploit. That's what you-\""]
["12:28,680","12:29,680","\"Lift through my marriage.\""]
["12:29,680","12:31,180","\"Now- Skipped right to the divorce.\""]
["12:31,180","12:33,680","\"I need you to look up passwords for this game right now.\""]
["12:33,680","12:34,680","\"Do you have to like...\""]
["12:34,680","12:36,680","\"...nash it?\""]
["12:36,680","12:39,180","\"You have to like stop it on the right one.\""]
["12:39,180","12:40,680","\"This is a part of the game.\""]
["12:40,680","12:41,680","\"Also- Oh, what?\""]
["12:41,680","12:43,680","\"Everything seems to be- You lost.\""]
["12:43,680","12:46,180","\"It gives you a time limit to put in a password.\""]
["12:46,180","12:47,680","\"I just typed in password into Google.\""]
["12:47,680","12:49,680","\"*laughs*\""]

["12:55,680","12:57,680","\"Wow\""]
["12:57,680","13:00,300","\"With each other I'm a little I'm a little chap see\""]
["13:00,300","13:03,160","\"See whoa oh\""]
["13:03,160","13:05,320","\"Okay, well there he goes half my health\""]
