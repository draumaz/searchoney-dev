["09:04,500","09:06,240","\"- You're gonna have to find the...\""]
["09:06,240","09:09,180","\"The breaker.\""]
["09:09,180","09:10,740","\"- I found the VHS.\""]
["09:10,740","09:12,020","\"- He broke the breaker.\""]
["09:12,020","09:13,060","\"- Oh, okay.\""]
["09:13,060","09:15,180","\"- That's not a videotape.\""]
["09:15,180","09:16,020","\"I found something.\""]
["09:16,020","09:18,180","\"- Put the photo in the VCR.\""]
["09:18,180","09:19,900","\"- Why would you put that on your wall?\""]
["09:19,900","09:22,060","\"- That's a fucking cool painting, okay?\""]
["09:22,060","09:23,660","\"- It looks goofy.\""]
["09:23,660","09:24,500","\"- I love it.\""]
["09:24,500","09:25,340","\"- I found the button.\""]
["09:25,340","09:27,100","\"- You people don't understand me.\""]
["09:27,100","09:27,940","\"- Wow.\""]
["09:27,940","09:28,820","\"- Derilect.\""]
["09:28,820","09:30,300","\"- That's what it says on the video.\""]
["09:30,300","09:32,260","\"It says Derilect House Footage.\""]
["09:32,260","09:34,060","\"It's like the first game.\""]
["09:34,060","09:35,780","\"- The mission was a derelict.\""]
["09:35,780","09:37,260","\"(coughs)\""]
["09:37,260","09:38,820","\"- What is this?\""]
["09:38,820","09:40,180","\"That's what Barry says.\""]
["09:40,180","09:41,260","\"What is this?\""]
["09:41,260","09:43,660","\"(laughs)\""]
["09:43,660","09:45,180","\"What is that?\""]
["09:45,180","09:47,900","\"(laughs)\""]
["09:47,900","09:49,500","\"- I was talking to Ding Dong earlier\""]
["09:49,500","09:52,980","\"about how my favorite meme is the Bayou Tapestry meme.\""]
["09:52,980","09:54,940","\"- Um, the Bayou Tapestry?\""]
["09:54,940","09:57,180","\"- Yeah, that's when you take another meme\""]
["09:57,180","10:00,700","\"and you Photoshop it together with pieces\""]
["10:00,700","10:03,260","\"from the biotapistry and you'd go,\""]
["10:03,260","10:08,260","\"my example, as I said, you would Photoshop\""]
["10:08,260","10:11,260","\"of just a normal little frog on a horse.\""]
["10:11,260","10:14,100","\"And they would say, here come that lad.\""]
["10:14,100","10:15,100","\"(audience laughs)\""]
["10:15,100","10:16,460","\"And that would have been the move.\""]
["10:16,460","10:18,780","\"- It is called Dara Lake House.\""]
["10:18,780","10:20,700","\"- Yeah, I guess that's actually the name of the tape.\""]
["10:20,700","10:22,260","\"- Is this a fake haunted house?\""]
["10:22,260","10:24,780","\"(screams)\""]
["10:24,780","10:25,620","\"- He went boom.\""]
["10:25,620","10:27,780","\"- Yeah, the sound does kind of, oh, I'm playing the video.\""]
["10:27,780","10:28,620","\"- Oh, what?\""]
["10:28,620","10:30,380","\"- Oh, I've been sucked into the VCR.\""]
["10:30,380","10:32,380","\"That's neat. That's really cool.\""]
["10:32,380","10:34,380","\"I'm surprised if we have to make a change.\""]
["10:34,380","10:36,380","\"Look, it's Tony Hawk.\""]
["10:36,380","10:38,380","\"I'm not too super in other craggy.\""]
["10:38,380","10:46,380","\"[Laughter]\""]
["10:46,380","10:48,380","\"Come on guys, let's rave.\""]
["10:48,380","10:54,380","\"[Laughter]\""]
["10:54,380","10:56,380","\"What's staring Tony Hawk?\""]
["10:56,380","10:58,640","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:58,640","10:59,920","\"(laughing)\""]
["10:59,920","11:01,760","\"- We're here at Situizanis.\""]
["11:01,760","11:05,460","\"(laughing)\""]
["11:05,460","11:07,700","\"What does this have to do with the Umbrella Corporation?\""]
["11:07,700","11:08,980","\"- Get it close up at Tony Hawk.\""]
["11:08,980","11:10,820","\"- I'm under my umbrella.\""]
["11:10,820","11:12,740","\"- I wanna see some liquors.\""]
["11:12,740","11:14,460","\"- I'll look you up front and pokey in the rear.\""]
["11:14,460","11:15,300","\"- After you.\""]
["11:15,300","11:16,140","\"- Ooh, is it haunted?\""]
["11:16,140","11:17,260","\"- Yes.\""]
["11:17,260","11:18,260","\"Yes.\""]
["11:18,260","11:19,500","\"- He just looks like Tony Hawk.\""]
["11:19,500","11:20,820","\"- He looks just like Tony Hawk.\""]
["11:20,820","11:21,660","\"- I know.\""]
["11:21,660","11:22,500","\"- You're right.\""]
["11:22,500","11:23,340","\"- Who was an anchor, you know?\""]
["11:23,340","11:24,580","\"- Weekend sub, Pete.\""]
["11:24,580","11:25,420","\"Not anchor.\""]
["11:25,420","11:26,420","\"Nothing.\""]
["11:26,420","11:28,420","\"What was that feeling?\""]
["11:28,420","11:31,180","\"It was a 900 Tony.\""]
["11:31,180","11:34,860","\"So does this imply that they shot this video back when...\""]
["11:34,860","11:38,140","\"... how could people record it to VHS?\""]
["11:38,140","11:40,340","\"And the camera man kept putting his hands up somehow.\""]
["11:40,340","11:41,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:41,340","11:42,340","\"With his hover camera.\""]
["11:42,340","11:45,380","\"Because the thing is, if it was back then they didn't have cameras that small that you\""]
["11:45,380","11:47,580","\"could operate them hands-free.\""]
["11:47,580","11:49,740","\"Get a shot at it.\""]
["11:49,740","11:54,620","\"Look, I found Pascati.\""]
["11:54,620","11:56,620","\"It's the same food.\""]
["11:56,620","11:58,620","\"Oh...\""]
["11:58,620","11:59,620","\"[laughs]\""]
["11:59,620","12:00,620","\"Andre!\""]
["12:00,620","12:02,620","\"Andre!\""]
["12:02,620","12:03,620","\"Where'd Andre go?\""]
["12:03,620","12:06,620","\"I like the implication that absolutely nothing in this house has changed.\""]
