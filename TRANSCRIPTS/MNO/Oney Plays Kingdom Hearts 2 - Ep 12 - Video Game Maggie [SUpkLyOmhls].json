["00:04,400","00:05,600","\"With friends.\""]
["00:05,600","00:08,600","\"Chris, did your playground ever have an uprising?\""]
["00:08,600","00:09,200","\"What's that?\""]
["00:09,200","00:11,800","\"Oh yeah, you can tell that story, can't you?\""]
["00:11,800","00:17,000","\"Uh, the fifth graders on our playground one day decided they wanted to have an uprising\""]
["00:17,000","00:19,600","\"against all the lower grades.\""]
["00:19,600","00:23,800","\"So they just started beating the shit out of everybody on the playground during recess.\""]
["00:23,800","00:24,200","\"*laughs*\""]
["00:24,200","00:28,400","\"And there were seriously like 40 kids lined up outside the principal's office.\""]
["00:28,400","00:28,900","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:28,900","00:32,380","\"because they were just going on like, they were just beating anyone up.\""]
["00:32,380","00:35,540","\"Like if you were out on the playground, someone was probably going to come over and beat you up.\""]
["00:35,540","00:39,740","\"I remember I got head butted in the crotch by a random kid I knew.\""]
["00:39,740","00:42,900","\"It was a, it was a wild, wacky time.\""]
["00:42,900","00:43,900","\"Awesome.\""]
["00:43,900","00:44,900","\"It wasn't.\""]
["00:44,900","00:47,380","\"I love shit like that.\""]
["00:47,380","00:48,660","\"I remember like my whole life.\""]
["00:48,660","00:49,820","\"I was like, Oh, that's normal.\""]
["00:49,820","00:51,340","\"That happens at schools, right?\""]
["00:51,340","00:54,380","\"I think stuff like that's funny.\""]
["00:54,380","00:57,700","\"As long as people aren't bringing knives to school, there was a kid of my\""]
["00:57,700","01:00,700","\"school used to bring in a switchblade and that's terrified of them.\""]
["01:00,700","01:02,700","\"What's the difference between why?\""]
["01:02,700","01:04,700","\"Nobody flex with them.\""]
["01:04,700","01:08,700","\"What's the difference between being cut open and just being bruised all over?\""]
["01:08,700","01:13,700","\"How severe would a bruise have to be considered to be cut?\""]
["01:13,700","01:17,700","\"I would argue a cut is worse because somebody sticks you with a knife.\""]
["01:17,700","01:18,700","\"That could be failed.\""]
["01:18,700","01:20,700","\"If it hits you in the wrong spot, you're done.\""]
["01:20,700","01:22,700","\"I would say what's the ratio here though?\""]
["01:22,700","01:25,700","\"What size would a bruise have to be that you could...\""]
["01:25,700","01:32,020","\"As bad as a knife yeah, I would say if it's all over your body if you came home from school black and blue all over\""]
["01:32,020","01:35,920","\"That would be pretty bad, but I would still rather be beating the shit out of them stab\""]
["01:35,920","01:40,040","\"I'd be pretty mad if somebody knocked out my tooth. That would be pissed off\""]
["01:40,040","01:42,540","\"Yeah, because it takes me like four days to grow one bag\""]
["01:42,540","01:47,340","\"It's supposed to take you like to what does Hercules even do into that poor guy? Oh?\""]
["01:47,340","01:49,980","\"He's been ha ha another one\""]
["01:51,420","01:55,620","\"Do you spin me right round? Everybody laughed really hard. I would laugh\""]
["01:55,620","02:03,700","\"Do you like this stage Julian the stage sucks? They put it underground and it's all boring. Yeah, they made it pretty boring in this one\""]
["02:03,700","02:08,460","\"It's it's only because all the areas look the same like all the tunnels have the exact same style\""]
["02:08,460","02:13,020","\"Yeah, and it's just not interesting. It's just rocks and dirt\""]
["02:13,020","02:13,740","\"I\""]
["02:13,740","02:17,840","\"Remember to the final coliseum fights that you actually do aren't interesting either\""]
["02:18,020","02:24,440","\"They just line up all the bosses from the game in big groups if ever a girl was to exist. I wish it was her\""]
["02:24,440","02:29,080","\"That would kiss me on the head so she could be crushed by a real pillar\""]
["02:29,080","02:38,900","\"My favorites, she's good. Yeah, she's got the big bazoom goes. It's true. She does. She's got the big hair on goes\""]

["02:45,660","02:47,660","\"Her boobies were not that big in the movie\""]
["02:47,660","02:55,860","\"It's it was the same number that uh when they were designing Laura Croft. Oh, yeah, she said it. I put it in wrong\""]
["02:55,860","02:58,260","\"She said it\""]
["02:58,260","03:00,260","\"You're not a hero. You piece of shit\""]
["03:00,260","03:04,940","\"That duck you're so right walking talking dogs\""]
["03:04,940","03:08,900","\"Well, look at my hair it's wiggly\""]
["03:08,900","03:13,900","\"Can you pick her up and swing her around she's then enough yeah\""]
["03:14,820","03:21,280","\"She looks like she would be satisfying to hit people with like if you grabbed her like around the ankles\""]
["03:21,280","03:23,780","\"And you use her like a bat\""]
["03:23,780","03:26,180","\"Why what would make it satisfying?\""]
["03:26,180","03:29,900","\"I don't know just her shape. Yeah, she's like she's like what is it like what is it like?\""]
["03:29,900","03:38,140","\"To decide in your mind. Okay. I need to pick up this woman and specifically in this pose because she's so stiff like I can imagine\""]
["03:38,140","03:42,660","\"Her being really hard. What do you think is gonna happen when you hit somebody with her?\""]
["03:43,860","03:46,260","\"I don't know they'd be hurt. I\""]
["03:46,260","03:52,140","\"Think she'd be hurt. She probably she probably looks like she would car for stone. Oh\""]

["04:55,320","05:00,100","\"It's a scenario that could lead to some funny situations if you had a person\""]
["05:00,100","05:07,460","\"From today time specifically yeah get sent back to the 90s. They would be trying to warn everybody about everything\""]
["05:08,020","05:14,820","\"And nobody would believe them. I always think about that, but it just wouldn't be a good idea to change anything\""]
["05:14,820","05:18,740","\"It would fuck it up so bad. It was so funny the way it already was. Yeah\""]

["06:25,660","06:31,420","\"Can see that being scary for a little it wasn't scary until everyone laughed and then didn't do anything about it\""]
