["00:13,000","00:14,600","\"Oh, this is what you're talking about.\""]
["00:14,600","00:16,100","\"I mean, I'm Lyle.\""]
["00:16,100","00:18,100","\"I'm Lyle and that's Tomar.\""]
["00:18,100","00:21,000","\"Anyways, uh, we're playing this...\""]
["00:21,000","00:24,000","\"Ding Dong and Julian are dealing with a broken laptop,\""]
["00:24,000","00:26,200","\"so we're doing this while they fix it.\""]
["00:26,200","00:27,200","\"Uh, broken heart.\""]
["00:27,200","00:28,200","\"Could I play a little God of War?\""]
["00:28,200","00:29,000","\"So...\""]
["00:29,000","00:30,600","\"Do you wanna play God very hard?\""]
["00:30,600","00:32,960","\"I wasn't just doing normal, let's just make it a shot.\""]
["00:32,960","00:37,880","\"Too normal, this is gonna be a walk in the Spartan Park.\""]
["00:37,880","00:41,880","\"I haven't played this since it first came out and I...\""]
["00:41,880","00:42,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:42,380","00:45,960","\"It's really weird how you remember stuff looking so much better when you first played it.\""]
["00:45,960","00:46,520","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:46,520","00:48,280","\"I mean this was originally on the PS2.\""]
["00:48,280","00:51,000","\"I guess this is a remaster technically.\""]
["00:51,000","00:51,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:51,400","00:57,240","\"But all the original videos were probably like highly compressed and I don't know if they really had like masters of them.\""]
["00:57,240","00:57,640","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:57,640","01:04,320","\"I also really like I firmly believe that with a lot of these games and you see like the old polygons but\""]
["01:04,320","01:11,320","\"In full HD on like a like a big TV. It makes them look kind of weird whereas they might actually look worse than they\""]
["01:11,320","01:19,720","\"Like the low resolution kind of smears it out, you know like then those rocks you can see all the polygons on them. It looks cool though\""]
["01:19,720","01:26,760","\"You can see how his shoulder joints are not in any way connected to his torso. Oh geez. Yeah. Wow\""]
["01:26,760","01:27,760","\"Wow.\""]
["01:27,760","01:30,560","\"Oh my god, I remember this looking.\""]
["01:30,560","01:32,560","\"Yeah, that's definitely pre-rendered.\""]
["01:32,560","01:33,560","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:33,560","01:34,560","\"That looked way worse than the game.\""]
["01:34,560","01:35,560","\"It snapped out.\""]
["01:35,560","01:36,560","\"But that's the thing.\""]
["01:36,560","01:39,880","\"At the time it happened, they pre-rendered it because it probably looked better than\""]
["01:39,880","01:44,240","\"the in-game graphics, but how it actually looked substantially worse.\""]
["01:44,240","01:46,760","\"Did most people even have a HDTV back then?\""]
["01:46,760","01:47,760","\"I don't think so.\""]
["01:47,760","01:49,760","\"I think they needed it, didn't they?\""]
["01:49,760","01:50,760","\"Did it?\""]
["01:50,760","01:51,760","\"Did it?\""]
["01:51,760","01:56,000","\"The PS2, like, I think was before HDTVs were common or maybe even before they were\""]
["01:56,000","01:59,480","\"You know what you're right dead rising was the first HD game I ever saw\""]
["01:59,480","02:01,480","\"Daniel\""]
["02:01,480","02:03,480","\"You got a strain\""]
["02:03,480","02:09,740","\"You got to feel like you're really pulling on a great and so great those feels like it\""]
["02:09,740","02:12,520","\"And then he just casually flings it like it's nothing\""]
["02:12,520","02:23,160","\"Is this game considered a classic now, I wouldn't think so Sony of America would probably call it that they would probably like to wouldn't they\""]
["02:24,040","02:27,280","\"Well, I know this game definitely has history. I mean yeah\""]
["02:27,280","02:32,680","\"I mean for sure there they're even like doing a new God of War now with the like beard beard crados\""]
["02:32,680","02:39,600","\"When I've been your opinions on that till Mars. I think beards were a good choice. I mean you would\""]
["02:39,600","02:41,880","\"I agree with you. I\""]
["02:41,880","02:46,360","\"Mean I feel like like it's they're definitely trying to be like hey\""]
["02:46,360","02:52,900","\"What have God of War met the last of us and we could do this whole sympathy for a helpless child angle?\""]
["02:53,680","03:00,000","\"So I mean that that part feels transparent but that alone that doesn't make it a bad game or a bad choice\""]
["03:00,000","03:02,000","\"That's just\""]
["03:02,000","03:07,720","\"Is a thing that they're doing I don't know I don't know if that works for God of War honestly\""]
["03:07,720","03:09,960","\"I don't know if God of War supposed to have a heart to it\""]
["03:09,960","03:16,240","\"Like didn't you play God of War three or at the end of God of War three hope saves everyone I\""]
["03:16,240","03:20,560","\"Don't think I ever played three. I played it the hell out of one and two\""]
["03:20,800","03:26,820","\"Yeah, three three has like this really bullshit ending where it's like the power was\""]
["03:26,820","03:31,920","\"Yeah, you the whole time and it was hope it was like there you go. Yeah mash him up\""]
["03:31,920","03:39,180","\"It was quick time events are no match for you Chris. I can identify shapes\""]
["03:39,180","03:43,920","\"I fucking hate this shit. This is the one thing I don't like I\""]
["03:43,920","03:49,080","\"Think it works in God of War just because it's sort of baked into the design of the game\""]
["03:49,080","03:55,100","\"You kind of all what always know when it's coming. I think you like initiate it. This is the best part of God of War right here\""]
["03:55,100","03:57,080","\"The rafts\""]
["03:57,080","04:04,580","\"Sailing on a long raft. Look at him go. He's trying to fall off. See it's weird. Oh, okay. All right. He's weirdly nimble\""]
["04:04,580","04:07,560","\"But he grabs on oh you did a little dive\""]
["04:07,560","04:10,760","\"I think it's an interesting choice to give like a big buff dude\""]
["04:10,760","04:17,240","\"Two two knives instead of like a giant hammer a huge like cloud sword or something because they could have easily\""]
["04:17,240","04:20,920","\"Yeah, I've gotten that direction. I mean you the whole idea of the of the\""]
["04:20,920","04:27,080","\"Extended knives on chains. I think was to be like we want something where you smash your mash your controller\""]
["04:27,080","04:31,520","\"And you will constantly be hitting everything and it looks cool. It does look cool\""]
["04:31,520","04:33,860","\"I think it was a it was a solid choice at the time\""]
["04:33,860","04:39,320","\"Huh at least for what this game was trying to do the boats look at them eat those polygon\""]
["04:39,320","04:42,880","\"Are you trying to get out that way? I don't think so. No, there you go\""]
["04:45,280","04:47,280","\"Okay stay away\""]
["04:47,280","04:56,100","\"Spoiler alert you kill that man three times. Yeah, that's right at the course of the series right yeah in every single game\""]
["04:56,100","04:59,040","\"You kill him the subsequent time like you go\""]
["04:59,040","05:01,480","\"I think you might actually kill him twice in this game\""]
["05:01,480","05:03,960","\"Yeah, I feel like he's a running game\""]
["05:03,960","05:10,420","\"Yeah, because you go to you go to Hades in like every game and you kill this guy after you kill him here\""]
["05:10,420","05:16,840","\"That's right multiple times so like because one time he was kind of a shithead and closed a door on you\""]
["05:16,840","05:19,740","\"Just fucking murder in three times\""]
["05:19,740","05:23,080","\"Yo, is the um you can kill me god\""]
["05:23,080","05:27,540","\"It's harpies for like no reason fucking wrap these guys you just like got them for no reason\""]
["05:27,540","05:33,180","\"I love harpies grab one of the running dudes. Okay. It's like unnecessarily mean\""]
["05:33,180","05:39,580","\"There's no reason but you get it like rewards you directly for doing that. That's fun\""]
["05:39,580","05:44,700","\"I know I like it well that was my point kind of war was never a game that was supposed to be about hard\""]
["05:44,700","05:48,420","\"It was supposed to be a game about just like and that ruthless war word\""]
["05:48,420","05:53,500","\"Doing that's what I hate that the new one fair new one is like I'm taking care of my son\""]
["05:53,500","05:58,860","\"I love him very much. Oh, isn't he isn't he more like kill this deer looking in the eye and kill it\""]
["05:58,860","06:04,860","\"This is like but dad I will have no son of mine be a pussy. I want to be an artist\""]
["06:05,740","06:13,540","\"If I see you drawing or break all your fingers, okay, you fucking ask fucker. I'll give you one singular finger\""]
["06:13,540","06:17,300","\"And you can curl it toward your chest and be like\""]
["06:17,300","06:22,660","\"Singular finger. It's a good bad name\""]
["06:22,660","06:26,620","\"Yeah, I dig it there he is\""]
["06:30,860","06:37,060","\"I like that that's fun. Yeah, that's awesome. I don't know. I I have never really had a problem with quick time events\""]
["06:37,060","06:39,660","\"I know that it's cool to shit on them, but I I really\""]
["06:39,660","06:45,200","\"Haven't I mean sometimes they're done really horrendously, but I've never on principle just hated them\""]
["06:45,200","06:50,260","\"Yeah, I think I think they've been used poorly, but you know they are what they are\""]
["06:50,260","06:54,460","\"They let you they let you add like tension to a cinematic part of the game\""]
["06:54,460","06:56,600","\"And they let you your carif\""]
["06:56,600","06:59,500","\"something that's not in its normal repertoire of moves.\""]
["06:59,500","07:00,340","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:00,340","07:02,520","\"- While still making it feel like it's--\""]
["07:02,520","07:04,020","\"- Like at the time God of War came out,\""]
["07:04,020","07:07,900","\"the idea of having all these contextual things you could do\""]
["07:07,900","07:09,640","\"actually was pretty cool.\""]
["07:09,640","07:13,420","\"I need to stop saying shit like that.\""]
["07:13,420","07:14,980","\"I sound like a dinosaur.\""]
["07:14,980","07:16,140","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:16,140","07:18,060","\"- Just something back in my day.\""]
["07:18,060","07:20,980","\"- Back in my day, we didn't have polygons.\""]
["07:20,980","07:23,180","\"- We didn't have context sensitive action.\""]
["07:23,180","07:24,140","\"- We just had dual guns.\""]
["07:24,140","07:26,420","\"- Greek mythology is super cool in itself.\""]
["07:26,420","07:34,180","\"It really is and everybody fucks everything and the main dude turns himself into a cow and the gods act how gods would act if there were gods\""]
["07:34,180","07:37,460","\"Assholes fleet Creighton. Yeah\""]
["07:37,460","07:42,120","\"Super cool. Don't bite me. You fucking interesting\""]
["07:42,120","07:49,600","\"I wonder I wonder if like the guy who like writes it we can say this about Greek mythology, right?\""]
["07:49,600","07:54,260","\"Like clearly somebody wrote it. We went to the top of the mountain. There's no there's no dudes\""]
["07:54,260","07:56,500","\"There's no gods up on all of this stuff.\""]
["07:56,500","07:59,660","\"We can definitively say that one some dude made up.\""]
["07:59,660","08:00,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:00,660","08:01,660","\"Right.\""]
["08:01,660","08:02,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:02,660","08:06,220","\"So like when it comes to the dude who made that up, like why was he just like fucking\""]
["08:06,220","08:16,500","\"okay, the water dude, he likes horses and he fucking every time you tell a lie, he makes\""]
["08:16,500","08:18,620","\"your daughter infertile.\""]
["08:18,620","08:24,940","\"Did that guy like try to kind of scholarly figure out like an educated guess?\""]
["08:24,940","08:32,180","\"Or did he just fucking what if it was just a guy who lived on Mount Olympus and wanted to make sure nobody came up there and bothered\""]
["08:32,180","08:35,980","\"So initially he just made up this story about like yeah\""]
["08:35,980","08:38,500","\"There's gods up there and they'll mess you up if you ever go\""]
["08:38,500","08:42,820","\"That's a holy place you can't go up there and and then people really bought into it\""]
["08:42,820","08:48,060","\"And he's like man I could I could I could I could turn this into a profitable business somehow\""]
["08:48,060","08:52,780","\"I mean like he wasn't the guy there's a few things were like there's a guy involved\""]
["08:52,780","08:56,200","\"You know and when there whenever there's a guy involved\""]
["08:56,200","09:03,660","\"There's a certain one I'm going out of my way not to men. Oh, how do you has like a guy involved in a religion?\""]
["09:03,660","09:09,060","\"You got to think like okay, so this dude this dude made profit and heavily from like how do you please up back up?\""]
["09:09,060","09:12,340","\"He like you do the gods, but with Mount Olympus\""]
["09:12,340","09:19,340","\"I don't think there was ever like a dude, like a real dude that walked around the earth in that religion, so...\""]
["09:19,340","09:21,340","\"I mean, but they had these like...\""]
["09:21,340","09:23,340","\"They're gonna write! They did have the heroes.\""]
["09:23,340","09:26,340","\"They had priestesses and they had like...\""]
["09:26,340","09:29,340","\"They had like... what do they call them? Oracles, yeah.\""]
["09:29,340","09:30,340","\"I mean, was...\""]
["09:30,340","09:36,340","\"And these people all got like crazy offerings to do whatever it was that they did for a living.\""]
["09:36,340","09:37,340","\"That's true.\""]
["09:37,340","09:41,340","\"Like, we're um... like the fucking ankle guy.\""]
["09:41,340","09:42,940","\"Uh, Achilles.\""]
["09:42,940","09:43,780","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["09:43,780","09:45,460","\"Was he like a real dude?\""]
["09:45,460","09:48,340","\"Obviously the invincible except for his heel thing.\""]
["09:48,340","09:49,180","\"That's not real.\""]
["09:49,180","09:52,580","\"But was he like a real guy that was like, oh yeah,\""]
["09:52,580","09:54,460","\"I'm every part of me is invincible,\""]

["09:55,700","09:57,180","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["09:57,180","09:57,620","\"Probably.\""]
["09:57,620","09:59,580","\"I feel like he didn't even mention that part\""]
["09:59,580","10:00,940","\"until after it happened.\""]
["10:00,940","10:03,300","\"He's like, oh, yeah, you know, he got my heel.\""]
["10:03,300","10:04,300","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["10:04,300","10:07,420","\"That happened to be my one weakness.\""]
["10:07,420","10:09,180","\"Like, make sure you write that down.\""]
["10:09,180","10:10,620","\"Someone write that down.\""]
["10:10,620","10:12,060","\"Look at these losers.\""]
["10:12,060","10:12,940","\"Go to hell.\""]
["10:12,940","10:15,740","\"Get out of here.\""]
["10:15,740","10:16,580","\"Get over here.\""]
["10:16,580","10:18,660","\"- You're sure showing them.\""]
["10:18,660","10:19,500","\"- I know, right?\""]
["10:19,500","10:20,620","\"- Stupid survivor.\""]
["10:20,620","10:22,740","\"- They're just trying to survive against this volley\""]
["10:22,740","10:26,860","\"of arrows and then this dude who has no reason\""]
["10:26,860","10:29,580","\"to hurt them just comes up and stabs them for sport.\""]
["10:29,580","10:31,940","\"- Can they hit me when I'm doing this?\""]
["10:31,940","10:33,260","\"- No, I think, oh.\""]
["10:33,260","10:34,620","\"- Oh. - Oh.\""]
["10:34,620","10:35,740","\"- They can fuck up your box.\""]
["10:35,740","10:37,700","\"- That's really silly that this comes back.\""]
["10:37,700","10:39,780","\"- You can kick the box with our two, I think.\""]
["10:39,780","10:44,700","\"Yeah, yeah, I think what you're supposed to do is just kind of like fuck I think you have to hold it down\""]
["10:44,700","10:49,680","\"It's so I remember like there's a few of these parts specifically that were actually difficult\""]
["10:49,680","10:52,900","\"There's one where you're doing this and it's like on a hill fuck\""]
["10:52,900","10:57,940","\"The first one was a little brutal the the second and third\""]
["10:57,940","11:01,600","\"I kind of remember being a bit more of a breeze, but the first one specifically I\""]
["11:01,600","11:06,380","\"Remember there's a few parts I know stupid asshole. That was your fault\""]
["11:08,860","11:15,220","\"You too. That's so mean. It's it's unnecessarily mean being a game is fun\""]
["11:15,220","11:22,060","\"Dude, it's just a fucking dick hole and this this was also it came out around the time like it was like mid-2000s edgy\""]
["11:22,060","11:29,240","\"Yeah, no one's so many need to like bullshit like a mortal compass into an action game that was just\""]
["11:29,240","11:32,780","\"You know it was cool because it it gave no fucks\""]
["11:32,780","11:35,140","\"There's a there's this interesting\""]
["11:35,540","11:38,260","\"theory that's probably written by someone who's not\""]
["11:38,260","11:45,120","\"Educated enough to have an opinion I say on the video game. Let's play on YouTube where they were saying like\""]
