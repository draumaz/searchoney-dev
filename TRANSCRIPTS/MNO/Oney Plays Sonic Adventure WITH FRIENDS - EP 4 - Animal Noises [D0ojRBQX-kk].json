["04:39,740","04:40,580","\"and knocks the TV.\""]
["04:40,580","04:43,980","\"It's because it's a loud noise.\""]
["04:44,700","04:47,180","\"No, it's because he's doing sit-ups. It's above the head.\""]
["04:47,180","04:49,740","\"You don't like the video where the cat smashes his face into a wall?\""]
["04:49,740","04:51,100","\"You know what those are pretty bad.\""]

["05:04,180","05:04,940","\"He's dying.\""]
["05:04,940","05:08,860","\"I like ones where cats are underestimating a jump they need to do.\""]
["05:08,860","05:09,860","\"He's just a pupa.\""]
["05:09,860","05:11,420","\"And so they hit the wall.\""]
