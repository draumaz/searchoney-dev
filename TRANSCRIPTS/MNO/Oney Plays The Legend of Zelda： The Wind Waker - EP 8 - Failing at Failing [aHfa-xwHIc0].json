["00:17,840","00:19,280","\"Oh yes I can.\""]
["00:19,280","00:22,560","\"You just aim it right towards the center. Uh oh. See?\""]
["00:22,560","00:25,280","\"Yeah that's it. So that's the problem is you don't see the other one.\""]

["01:38,920","01:40,920","\"That's amazing. Yeah\""]
["01:40,920","01:45,520","\"It's fine. You just center it you get the deck of leaf now you can uh\""]
