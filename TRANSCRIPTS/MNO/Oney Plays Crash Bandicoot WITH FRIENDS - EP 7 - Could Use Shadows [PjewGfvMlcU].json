["00:03,400","00:05,360","\"*sigh* With friends!\""]
["00:05,360","00:06,440","\"*chuckles* What the fuck?\""]
["00:06,440","00:09,280","\"*sigh* I like this music. It's cool.\""]
["00:09,280","00:15,800","\"*chuckles* Oh! I push stacks, okay.\""]
["00:15,800","00:20,560","\"This isn't a very unresponsive game. Either that or there's something wrong.\""]
["00:20,560","00:28,320","\"Oh! Oh! It's that you have really slow acceleration in this. It feels clumsy.\""]
["00:28,720","00:33,480","\"Not to mention you can't steer your jumps really at all you have to commit to them\""]
["00:33,480","00:41,420","\"Look at them looking around - I mean - is a huge improvement on that everything is really responsive and it feels great\""]
["00:41,420","00:44,280","\"Oh my god, my debt perception was off there\""]
["00:44,280","00:49,600","\"First I just want you to know that whenever I react that way. I'm not judging you for being a bad player\""]
["00:49,600","00:54,480","\"Don't worry everyone else's I'm just saying it's true. You suck at crash by him quick\""]
["00:54,480","00:59,240","\"I hate it. Don't you know I can play Call of Duty with one arm tied behind my eye?\""]
["00:59,240","01:01,880","\"When was the last time you played this by the way?\""]
["01:01,880","01:07,780","\"Um, I don't know because I haven't played this since it first came out. Um, probably I don't know three or four years ago\""]
["01:07,780","01:14,320","\"Cuz that's that's the thing too is when a lot of people pick up games like this. It's usually like okay\""]
["01:14,320","01:19,160","\"You're not super familiar with it. Oh my god. I can't see where\""]
["01:21,080","01:27,260","\"Yeah, it's really awkward in this one that's a mention. It's not it's a black backdrop. So you can't even keep track of your shadow\""]
["01:27,260","01:34,600","\"But typically when people are doing stuff like this it could be games up there not even\""]
["01:34,600","01:39,600","\"Super familiar with so obviously they're gonna have a harder time than someone who's played it pretty recently\""]
["01:39,600","01:43,540","\"I just find it hard to carry a conversation and concentrate. Yeah, that's the biggest thing\""]
["01:43,540","01:49,300","\"It is really hard to talk and that's what everyone's I ended up standing still on a falling platform because I was trying to talk\""]
["01:49,300","01:51,420","\"That's what everyone claims is so easy to do.\""]
["01:51,420","01:54,900","\"I get frustrations on stuff like that.\""]
["01:54,900","01:57,180","\"Yeah, like if you're watching something for the game,\""]
["01:57,180","01:59,700","\"but why the fuck would anyone watch us for the game?\""]
["01:59,700","02:01,500","\"That's true.\""]
["02:01,500","02:04,620","\"Because they've never seen this game before.\""]
["02:04,620","02:07,980","\"They would think, \"\"What's this new Crash Bandicoot business I want to find out?\"\"\""]
["02:07,980","02:09,500","\"Clearly not really fucking...\""]
["02:09,500","02:10,500","\"I've never seen this game before.\""]
["02:10,500","02:11,940","\"What the fuck were they dying?\""]
["02:11,940","02:13,660","\"I like that.\""]
["02:13,660","02:14,500","\"He's waiting for you.\""]
["02:14,500","02:15,180","\"Three of them.\""]
["02:15,180","02:16,980","\"If I marketed myself as an elite gamer,\""]
["02:16,980","02:18,660","\"then I understand what people are mad.\""]
["02:18,660","02:19,700","\"- I'm a league gamer.\""]
["02:19,700","02:20,940","\"- Fucking.\""]
["02:20,940","02:21,780","\"- Watch out!\""]
["02:21,780","02:23,580","\"- Oh my god.\""]
["02:23,580","02:24,420","\"- That was terrible.\""]
["02:24,420","02:25,400","\"- That was close.\""]
["02:25,400","02:26,240","\"- Wow!\""]
["02:26,240","02:29,540","\"- If you wanna write a teenage character,\""]
["02:29,540","02:30,380","\"I'm sorry they're 20.\""]
["02:30,380","02:32,660","\"- But they're not teenage, they're like 24.\""]
["02:32,660","02:34,220","\"- Listen, that's millennials.\""]
["02:34,220","02:39,220","\"They are 20 plus, but act like they're 11.\""]
["02:39,220","02:40,380","\"- I don't like that.\""]
["02:40,380","02:42,740","\"- I'm adulting.\""]
["02:42,740","02:46,180","\"- I am a nitto, I'm so good to meet you.\""]
["02:46,180","02:49,840","\"- I realize that probably sounds really hypocritical\""]
["02:49,840","02:52,920","\"coming from a channel where we make part sounds all day.\""]
["02:52,920","02:54,100","\"- That's true.\""]
["02:54,100","02:56,060","\"- Although-- - Listen, we don't act\""]
["02:56,060","02:57,180","\"like this all the time.\""]
["02:57,180","02:58,940","\"- I think part of the reason we laugh at that though\""]
["02:58,940","03:00,460","\"is because it's also stupid when we're in the--\""]
["03:00,460","03:02,020","\"- No, obviously it's ironic.\""]
["03:02,020","03:03,020","\"- Let's get this guy.\""]
["03:03,020","03:05,100","\"- But it probably doesn't come off that way.\""]
["03:05,100","03:06,180","\"- I guess that's probably not.\""]
["03:06,180","03:08,460","\"- When you're watching somebody videos like this,\""]
["03:08,460","03:11,020","\"it probably, it's very easy to just be like,\""]
["03:11,020","03:12,500","\"\"\"Oh, that's what they're like all the time.\"\"\""]
["03:12,500","03:13,620","\"- Clearly we should be saying,\""]
["03:13,620","03:15,860","\"\"\"Ugg\"\" and \"\"Like\"\" all the time,\""]
["03:15,860","03:20,160","\"And uh, dot dot dot dot singing the doom song.\""]
["03:20,160","03:20,980","\"Do they really?\""]
["03:20,980","03:22,460","\"He says doom doom doom.\""]
["03:22,460","03:22,960","\"Yep.\""]
["03:22,960","03:24,460","\"And he says tacos.\""]
["03:24,460","03:25,820","\"I thought you were going to say that.\""]
["03:25,820","03:31,500","\"I do say the-- that's what I was very curious if this guy-- the guy who made-- I don't know his name.\""]
["03:31,500","03:37,160","\"I was very curious if the guy who made Night in the Woods was actually specifically inspired by invaders in,\""]
["03:37,160","03:41,940","\"because they got the tacos, they got the doom, they got the random character.\""]
["03:41,940","03:44,140","\"That's the one everybody likes, by the way.\""]
["03:44,140","03:46,140","\"They say he's so cute.\""]
["03:46,140","03:47,580","\"He put cups on his ears.\""]
["03:47,580","03:48,420","\"He's so wacky.\""]
["03:48,420","03:53,060","\"Oh, that's what I say when I'm playing it.\""]
["03:53,060","03:56,060","\"- We talked about Night in the Woods way longer\""]
["03:56,060","03:57,180","\"than I wanted to.\""]
["03:57,180","03:59,180","\"- I feel like it's a good discussion though,\""]
["03:59,180","04:00,340","\"'cause otherwise we're not gonna have anything\""]
["04:00,340","04:02,420","\"to talk about. - It just makes me sad.\""]
["04:02,420","04:04,060","\"- I mean, I bought it.\""]
["04:04,060","04:06,620","\"I wanted to actually hope for it to be something\""]
["04:06,620","04:08,460","\"more than that. - Yeah.\""]
["04:08,460","04:10,340","\"- I was worried that's what it was gonna be\""]
["04:10,340","04:11,740","\"but at the same time. - I knew it.\""]
["04:11,740","04:12,580","\"- When I saw-- - I was the one\""]
["04:12,580","04:13,420","\"who was optimistic.\""]
["04:13,420","04:14,900","\"I was like, we really should play it.\""]
["04:14,900","04:15,820","\"I think it would be neat.\""]
["04:15,820","04:18,700","\"- I love how it looks visually and oh my god.\""]
["04:18,700","04:21,020","\"'Cause I think that's the thing too.\""]
["04:21,020","04:22,700","\"A lot of people probably assume for me like,\""]
["04:22,700","04:25,780","\"oh you just want all games to be video games\""]
["04:25,780","04:26,620","\"where it's action.\""]
["04:26,620","04:28,740","\"No, I can take it into something like that.\""]
["04:28,740","04:30,620","\"I am completely fine with something like that\""]
["04:30,620","04:32,620","\"if it does a good job with it.\""]
["04:32,620","04:36,020","\"The visuals were why most people back the Kickstarter\""]
["04:36,020","04:39,500","\"wasn't 'cause they're like, oh, punk teenagers.\""]
["04:39,500","04:40,580","\"That's what I want.\""]
["04:40,580","04:43,740","\"If anything, that seems to me like it would push people.\""]
["04:43,740","04:45,260","\"- If it didn't have animal characters\""]
["04:45,260","04:46,660","\"and it didn't have that art style,\""]
["04:46,660","04:48,460","\"nobody would care about it.\""]
["04:48,460","04:50,020","\"If it was people characters,\""]
["04:50,020","04:51,540","\"'cause I'm mostly only,\""]
["04:51,540","04:53,620","\"that's what the audience right now,\""]
["04:53,620","04:56,220","\"it seems to be just exclusively furries at this point,\""]
["04:56,220","04:58,660","\"'cause I don't hear anyone talk about it.\""]
["04:58,660","05:01,900","\"Everyone like day one was big about it,\""]
["05:01,900","05:03,700","\"and then they just kind of shut up.\""]
["05:03,700","05:06,980","\"A lot of websites still haven't even reviewed it,\""]
["05:06,980","05:08,220","\"but it did well.\""]
["05:08,220","05:10,780","\"- They made half a million in like the first week.\""]
["05:10,780","05:11,780","\"- What the?\""]
["05:11,780","05:13,460","\"- Oh fucking come on dude.\""]
["05:13,460","05:15,580","\"- You got flat and on top of the acid.\""]
["05:15,580","05:16,820","\"- These bouncing barrels,\""]
["05:16,820","05:18,780","\"you can't fucking see where they are.\""]
["05:18,780","05:19,820","\"- I'm trying to think though,\""]
["05:19,820","05:23,500","\"there was something really stereotypical\""]
["05:23,500","05:25,660","\"of like writing a teenage character that they did.\""]
["05:25,660","05:27,940","\"I'm forgetting what it was.\""]
["05:27,940","05:29,860","\"Like I, what is it?\""]
["05:29,860","05:31,660","\"- I mean, I just think about the entire character.\""]
["05:31,660","05:33,140","\"- It is the entire thing.\""]
["05:33,140","05:36,580","\"It's why it's frustrating to hear people say\""]
["05:36,580","05:41,540","\"It's so relatable because it's taking the easy way out on everything.\""]
["05:41,540","05:42,540","\"It's just going...\""]
["05:42,540","05:45,740","\"Maybe everybody who relates to the character is a teenager.\""]
["05:45,740","05:47,580","\"They think?\""]
["05:47,580","05:48,580","\"It could be.\""]
["05:48,580","05:51,820","\"But even then, it's like, oh, they dropped out of college.\""]
["05:51,820","05:52,980","\"I relate to that.\""]
["05:52,980","05:56,700","\"Okay, do you relate to hallucinating all the time?\""]
["05:56,700","05:57,700","\"Passing out randomly?\""]
["05:57,700","05:58,700","\"Vomiting for no reason?\""]
["05:58,700","06:00,540","\"That's a whole another discussion.\""]
["06:00,540","06:04,940","\"Breaking down and deciding that you're disconnected from reality knowledge.\""]
["06:04,940","06:08,740","\"So you're going to smash someone's face in with a baseball bat. That's what you connect with is that you?\""]
["06:08,740","06:11,500","\"Is that's the character? That's the main character\""]
["06:11,500","06:16,620","\"I hope you don't relate with that fully look at this shit. How am I supposed to dodge this?\""]
["06:16,620","06:21,160","\"I can't I think that I the thing that I really that oh you did it Chris\""]
["06:21,160","06:28,540","\"The thing that bugs me about that specifically is I understand people being like oh, I also have a mental illness\""]
["06:28,540","06:30,780","\"I can I can empathize with that. That's one thing\""]
["06:31,260","06:37,340","\"But it's not a mental illness issue. It's not an allegory. It's that they went crazy because a\""]
["06:37,340","06:41,620","\"Yep, a fucking Lovecraftian monster entered their dreams\""]
["06:41,620","06:45,740","\"I think people people too who are analyzing the game were like, oh well\""]
["06:45,740","06:53,940","\"It still could be in their head no because no because they go to great lengths to make to show the audience that it's not and they bring in a fucking cult\""]
["06:53,940","06:56,340","\"Who's talking about things that they're already aware of too?\""]
["06:56,340","07:00,580","\"So but which by the way no build up on the cult in any way\""]
["07:00,580","07:05,940","\"They just show them here and there and then the end of the game is an hour and a half dedicated then just saying\""]
["07:05,940","07:10,300","\"This is who we are and this is everything we're doing and this is our plan and this is why we're here\""]
["07:10,300","07:15,460","\"And it's like great, you know, you had seven hours to build this up and you didn't do it\""]
["07:15,460","07:19,880","\"You're just dropping it at the end. That's bad writing in general. Where are the checkpoints?\""]
["07:21,100","07:24,580","\"fucking Jesus they really should have shadows under those by the way\""]
["07:24,580","07:26,580","\"yeah I\""]
["07:26,580","07:32,620","\"Crash has a shadow why don't I don't know because I am fucking oh there was a check point okay\""]
["07:32,620","07:38,260","\"It's a useful thing in a lot of games. I remember people the the Winnie the poo\""]
["07:38,260","07:40,980","\"Baseball flash game that everyone said super hard\""]
["07:40,980","07:46,300","\"The the secret to that one is that you just watch the shadow because the perspective doesn't matter\""]
["07:46,300","07:48,860","\"I'm just blasting through it because there's no strategy\""]
["07:48,860","07:54,220","\"There's no way to actually see where the fuck it is. Is it random when he throws a bouncing one? It seems like it\""]
["07:54,220","07:59,680","\"Yeah, I can't fucking I can't see where it is. I mean, yeah sure\""]
["07:59,680","08:06,100","\"That said if you like nine the woods, that's fine like I'm not gonna hate you god bless you for being able to look past all the stuff\""]
["08:06,100","08:08,100","\"That we didn't like yeah\""]
["08:08,100","08:12,100","\"Get out of there\""]
["08:18,460","08:21,020","\"My name is Crash and I'm here to flop!\""]
["08:21,020","08:22,020","\"Help!\""]
["08:22,020","08:23,860","\"Ton of brought me into the trees!\""]
["08:23,860","08:25,660","\"The mushroom tree.\""]
["08:25,660","08:26,660","\"Pop.\""]
["08:26,660","08:29,460","\"This color is really nice up here.\""]
["08:29,460","08:30,460","\"Pop.\""]
["08:30,460","08:31,460","\"Oh.\""]
["08:31,460","08:32,460","\"Did you get?\""]
["08:32,460","08:33,460","\"You fucking loser.\""]
["08:33,460","08:35,020","\"I didn't mean it.\""]
["08:35,020","08:36,020","\"You're cool.\""]
["08:36,020","08:37,700","\"I forgot it's not Crash too.\""]
["08:37,700","08:38,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:38,700","08:39,700","\"It's weird too.\""]
["08:39,700","08:40,700","\"What were you trying to do?\""]
["08:40,700","08:42,540","\"If you spin, he kind of just goes out of control while spinning.\""]
["08:42,540","08:43,540","\"You can't stop.\""]
["08:43,540","08:44,540","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:44,540","08:45,540","\"He skates along.\""]
["08:45,540","08:46,540","\"See?\""]
["08:46,540","08:47,540","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:47,540","08:52,880","\"Yeah, look at that. That's just me tapping it. That's really weird. I was gonna take a while to get used to\""]
["08:52,880","09:02,340","\"Well, I see all of them are now this perspective. There's no I'm telling you it's fucking bullshit\""]
["09:02,340","09:06,080","\"If it was in 2d like, you know side view would be nice be fine\""]
["09:06,080","09:16,240","\"Okay, well, there's no shadow I I'm looking at the exact spot there that I need to get to the not the changes\""]
["09:16,240","09:19,240","\"Yep, it does.\""]
["09:19,240","09:22,240","\"Boom, boom.\""]
["09:22,240","09:24,240","\"They really fucked this one.\""]
["09:24,240","09:26,240","\"Why did anybody like this game when it came out?\""]
["09:26,240","09:28,240","\"I feel like people are a lot more.\""]
["09:28,240","09:29,240","\"Hey, you did it, baby.\""]
["09:29,240","09:30,240","\"I feel like people...\""]
["09:30,240","09:31,240","\"Do you know how I did that?\""]
["09:31,240","09:32,240","\"I feel like people...\""]
["09:32,240","09:37,240","\"I looked at the grading as it was bouncing to just memorize what spot it was I could stand on.\""]
["09:37,240","09:41,240","\"I feel like people would tear apart a game if it was this hard to get through.\""]
["09:41,240","09:42,240","\"Oh.\""]
["09:42,240","09:43,240","\"I know.\""]
["09:43,240","09:44,240","\"It's challenging.\""]
