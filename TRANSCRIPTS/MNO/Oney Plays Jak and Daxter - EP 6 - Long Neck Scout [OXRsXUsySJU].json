["00:11,600","00:14,400","\"I don't know why the police were aiming at him.\""]
["00:14,400","00:16,280","\"\"\"He's that piece that was too long and fuckin' wrong.\"\"\""]

["00:17,800","00:18,600","\"\"\"That's why.\"\"\""]
["00:18,600","00:20,000","\"\"\"Why would they want to hurt him?\"\"\""]
["00:20,000","00:22,960","\"\"\"He lived in a nice little British house.\"\"\""]
["00:22,960","00:24,400","\"\"\"He didn't like friendly?\"\"\""]
["00:24,400","00:25,600","\"\"\"Yeah, he didn't do anything.\"\"\""]
["00:25,600","00:27,040","\"\"\"He was just a long neck man.\"\"\""]
["00:27,040","00:29,960","\"It sounded like he was like scouting for prey.\""]
["00:29,960","00:31,400","\"Oh, that's possible.\""]
["00:31,400","00:33,400","\"He's a log like scout.\""]
["00:33,400","00:34,880","\"[LAUGHING]\""]
["00:34,880","00:35,720","\"Like a scout ant.\""]
["00:35,720","00:36,320","\"He's like a scout ant.\""]
["00:36,320","00:37,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:37,160","00:38,080","\"Back to the-- OK, no.\""]
["00:38,080","00:39,240","\"We never resolved this.\""]
["00:39,240","00:40,480","\"Is there such things as a scout ant?\""]
["00:40,480","00:41,600","\"Yes or no?\""]
["00:41,600","00:42,200","\"No.\""]
["00:42,200","00:43,560","\"What do you mean no?\""]
["00:43,560","00:45,000","\"It sounds pretty fucking fake.\""]
["00:45,000","00:46,880","\"Because the act just walked out of the room in a huff.\""]
["00:46,880","00:48,600","\"He was tired of this conversation.\""]
["00:48,600","00:49,520","\"Scout ants.\""]
["00:49,520","00:52,960","\"Someone once told me that they send out one ant\""]
["00:52,960","00:54,280","\"to look around to see if there's food.\""]
["00:54,280","00:56,160","\"And if they find it, that that ant goes back\""]
["00:56,160","01:00,160","\"and tell the other ants and then that big long line of ants come, is that true?\""]
["01:00,160","01:01,740","\"That might be true.\""]
["01:01,740","01:03,540","\"Sit down or ask fucking scout ants!\""]
["01:03,540","01:05,100","\"This is being conversational.\""]
["01:05,100","01:08,160","\"Oh, fuck you! You made me feel like an idiot!\""]
["01:08,160","01:11,380","\"You made me feel like I was a fucking moron thinking that...\""]
["01:11,380","01:13,620","\"Ants are fucking really smart.\""]
["01:13,620","01:17,000","\"This is some Crash Bandicoot bullshit I've ever seen it.\""]
["01:17,000","01:19,420","\"This game is made by Not Hold a Dog.\""]
["01:19,420","01:21,000","\"Yeah, but they've already done this shtick.\""]
["01:21,000","01:25,100","\"They should get some new ideas, like a white male swinging around on a rope.\""]
["01:25,600","01:26,600","\"*laughs*\""]
["01:26,600","01:32,540","\"That would be a pretty outlandish one. I don't know why nobody's ever thought of it. I'm kidding, but uh\""]
["01:32,540","01:38,320","\"Obviously, I'm not the most social justicey guy in the world\""]
["01:38,320","01:44,720","\"But I will say there was a point where I was getting kind of sick of hearing that voice actor voicing every fucking game character\""]
["01:44,720","01:51,800","\"No one North. Yeah, cuz he never changes his voice to sound different. I mean mostly people cast him because of that\""]
["01:51,800","01:56,860","\"I know I know like this not obviously if I was him I would do the same, but I was just getting sick of hearing it\""]
["01:56,860","02:04,200","\"He was a good boy. I mean he's still is an excellent voice actor, but it gets old when you all you hear is him in every fucking game\""]
["02:04,200","02:09,560","\"And he always yeah, he was almost always like the same type of character\""]
["02:09,560","02:20,540","\"He's like I'm I'm an every man who now has to be a shoot boy to me\""]
["02:20,540","02:25,820","\"He was always just man man man guy man guy man guy and dude boy\""]
["02:25,820","02:31,160","\"Obviously he's a talented motherfucker. It doesn't he do the motion capture as well. Yeah, he does\""]
["02:31,160","02:35,680","\"Yeah, that's that's gotta take some skill. Yeah, it does like video game acting is\""]
["02:35,680","02:41,860","\"Pretty much just acting now. Yeah, I would love a cheap motion capture suit\""]
["02:41,860","02:44,260","\"So I can make fun videos\""]
["02:44,260","02:48,220","\"You should get one. Maybe I will lile then you'll see\""]
["02:49,100","02:51,100","\"Will you wear it always?\""]
["02:51,100","02:52,100","\"I'll wear it always.\""]
["02:52,100","02:54,100","\"I'll wear it in my gymma jams.\""]
["02:54,100","02:57,100","\"What are these things again? Eggs?\""]
["02:57,100","02:59,100","\"Yeah, they're precursor eggs.\""]
["02:59,100","03:01,100","\"Everyone loves them.\""]
["03:01,100","03:05,100","\"I was reading comments on our OniPlays YouTube videos\""]
["03:05,100","03:10,100","\"and I saw someone said that the precursors were pretty much just gotten rid of in the third game as a joke.\""]
["03:10,100","03:12,100","\"Yeah, have you not played it?\""]
["03:12,100","03:13,100","\"No.\""]
["03:13,100","03:17,100","\"Uh, yeah, there's a little bit of a reveal with them.\""]
["03:17,100","03:19,100","\"It turns out it was all bullshit.\""]
["03:19,100","03:20,100","\"Kind of, yeah.\""]
["03:20,100","03:21,100","\"That's really lame.\""]
["03:21,100","03:23,100","\"It isn't, it isn't.\""]
["03:23,100","03:26,100","\"It's kind of like a Wizard of Oz type thing.\""]
["03:26,100","03:27,100","\"I feel you.\""]
["03:27,100","03:30,100","\"But I kind of liked it,\""]
["03:30,100","03:34,100","\"'cause those games get like stupid dark at points.\""]
["03:34,100","03:36,100","\"Yeah, and then that's like with a humor and all.\""]
["03:36,100","03:41,100","\"Yeah, it's a little bit of like levity to kind of bring it all home.\""]
["03:41,100","03:42,100","\"Bring it all.\""]
["03:42,100","03:43,100","\"What?\""]

["04:13,220","04:18,220","\"Is that why he's so drunk he's hallucinating a big penguin that doesn't make any sense. I know it honestly\""]
["04:18,220","04:21,700","\"I I legitimately love that movie, but that's the only part I don't like really\""]
["04:21,700","04:24,420","\"Oh, yeah, I just I was taking it up a second. I go for that coffee\""]
["04:24,420","04:27,980","\"I just read the shitty thing about that is is that when you try to show people that movie\""]
["04:27,980","04:29,980","\"That's the first scene they get\""]
["04:29,980","04:33,820","\"It's really it's really funny, but the rest of the movie is hysterical\""]
["04:33,820","04:39,580","\"No, I that movie I still hold up it has a lot of funny stuff. It's hysterical at points. I've seen was at the dinner table\""]
["04:39,580","04:41,580","\"He's like spitting the sound out\""]
["04:41,700","04:47,940","\"No, my favorite part is that speech was like god. I've got a mercy on yourself. Yeah, not only was I like I used to love the whole thing\""]
