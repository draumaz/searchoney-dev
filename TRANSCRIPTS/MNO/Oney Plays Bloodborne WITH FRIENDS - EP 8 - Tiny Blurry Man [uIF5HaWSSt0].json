["05:24,240","05:27,360","\"-What if the man just fell out of the screen and he was tiny in real life?\""]
["05:27,360","05:30,520","\"-Like Mike TV from where we walk.\""]

["05:53,280","05:54,600","\"- No he won, 'cause he's trying.\""]
["05:54,600","05:56,440","\"- You'd find him like behind the stove,\""]
["05:56,440","05:57,280","\"he suffocates.\""]
["05:57,280","05:59,480","\"- Yeah but he's clearly your whole stove.\""]
["05:59,480","06:01,320","\"- He's clearly a supernatural entity\""]
["06:01,320","06:02,880","\"if he comes out of the fucking TV.\""]
["06:02,880","06:04,360","\"- If he's a tiny man running around,\""]
["06:04,360","06:06,360","\"that doesn't mean anything.\""]
["06:06,360","06:07,800","\"His power was to be a tiny.\""]

["06:12,880","06:13,960","\"and put his hands on the wall\""]
["06:13,960","06:15,000","\"and started flipping up the wall\""]
["06:15,000","06:16,360","\"like those little guys you throw at the wall\""]
["06:16,360","06:17,200","\"and flip down the wall?\""]
["06:17,200","06:19,800","\"- Except in reverse, he's going up the wall.\""]
["06:19,800","06:21,880","\"And he goes up to the ceiling and hides in the crack.\""]
["06:21,880","06:23,080","\"- I'd hang up a bug zapper,\""]
["06:23,080","06:24,320","\"so he could crash in the wall.\""]
["06:24,320","06:25,520","\"- He's not gonna fall for that.\""]
["06:25,520","06:28,080","\"He's a grown human male.\""]
["06:28,080","06:28,920","\"He's not a bug.\""]
["06:28,920","06:29,760","\"- He's a tiny.\""]
["06:29,760","06:30,680","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:30,680","06:32,040","\"And he's blurry.\""]
["06:32,040","06:32,880","\"- But why is he blurry?\""]
["06:32,880","06:34,640","\"- That one became out of the TV.\""]
["06:34,640","06:35,960","\"- He's got static and he's blurry.\""]
["06:35,960","06:37,300","\"- That would be freaky in any case.\""]
["06:37,300","06:38,720","\"If there was a normal size person\""]
["06:38,720","06:40,600","\"and they were just blurry all the time.\""]
["06:40,600","06:42,200","\"- I'm shooting Nerf gun at him.\""]
["06:42,200","06:45,240","\"He turned the Nerf gun black and white.\""]
["06:45,240","06:49,600","\"- How would you react if you went out to go get some snacks\""]
["06:49,600","06:53,320","\"at night and you went out into, it was a dark alley\""]
["06:53,320","06:55,400","\"and this guy, it's perfectly lit.\""]
["06:55,400","06:58,800","\"It's not a dark alley, it's lit and so a guy comes out.\""]
["06:58,800","07:00,920","\"- It's perfectly lit dark alley.\""]
["07:00,920","07:03,040","\"Just enough light to be dark.\""]
["07:03,040","07:04,560","\"- I can't think of this.\""]
["07:04,560","07:08,640","\"guy comes out and his edges are all blurry and you can't make out his features and he\""]
["07:08,640","07:17,440","\"goes \"\"I'd be frightened. I throw a trash can lid at him and see if it goes through him.\"\"\""]
["07:17,440","07:19,480","\"It bounces off of him and he goes \"\"Rooooo!\"\"\""]
["07:19,480","07:27,300","\"Then I'd run at him and kill him because he got hurt by a trash can lid.\""]
["07:27,300","07:32,520","\"But Julian, what if the little man came out and he ran up and grabbed your foot and then\""]
["07:32,520","07:34,760","\"You were just, no sound came out of you anymore.\""]
["07:34,760","07:37,280","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:37,280","07:38,120","\"- Okay.\""]
["07:38,120","07:41,080","\"- You're just like screaming, like no sound.\""]
["07:41,080","07:43,560","\"- Stealing Ariel's voice.\""]
["07:43,560","07:46,000","\"- Yeah, all you can hear is a really low rumble like.\""]
["07:46,000","07:50,520","\"But he's like screaming blood at the top of his lungs.\""]
["07:50,520","07:51,600","\"- Oh, you're here already.\""]
["07:51,600","07:52,840","\"Make your blasting.\""]
["07:52,840","07:55,320","\"- We're gonna get through this.\""]
["07:55,320","07:56,480","\"- After we get through this,\""]
["07:56,480","07:58,000","\"'cause when I first played this game,\""]
["07:58,000","08:01,160","\"I thought the whole thing took place in this town.\""]
["08:01,160","08:03,500","\"But, and it was like, oh, there's more, there's a world out there.\""]
["08:03,500","08:04,840","\"Oh, it's a white hat.\""]
["08:04,840","08:05,840","\"Owie!\""]

["08:25,600","08:27,680","\"Yeah, wide walker.\""]
["08:27,680","08:29,640","\"That's awfully offensive.\""]
["08:29,640","08:31,720","\"Yeah, I would say that's our word.\""]
["08:31,720","08:32,640","\"- I like this game.\""]
["08:32,640","08:37,200","\"- Does Donkey Jockey sound like a racial slur?\""]
["08:37,200","08:38,200","\"Donkey Jockey.\""]
["08:38,200","08:39,800","\"- It doesn't sound like a racial slur,\""]
["08:39,800","08:42,920","\"but it sounds like it implies you fuck donkeys.\""]
["08:42,920","08:43,840","\"- Oh, right, yeah.\""]
["08:43,840","08:44,680","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:44,680","08:48,680","\"- I think back then they just say you're a Donkey fucker,\""]
["08:48,680","08:49,520","\"though.\""]
["08:49,520","08:50,400","\"I think they were pretty blunt about that.\""]
["08:50,400","08:51,640","\"They weren't very creative.\""]
["08:51,640","08:57,000","\"And I think in that day, it probably wasn't that weird.\""]
["08:58,520","09:00,520","\"Yeah, so\""]
["09:00,520","09:07,080","\"Hey, sister, so sister, I'm gonna get that doll sister. Oh long\""]

["09:39,240","09:41,240","\"Pretty good.\""]
["09:41,240","09:42,240","\"It's pretty nifty.\""]
["09:42,240","09:43,240","\"I will say this game has--\""]
["09:43,240","09:46,240","\"I do like how when you hit people do you see the blood splatters?\""]
["09:46,240","09:47,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:47,240","09:48,240","\"They actually go with your blade.\""]

["09:50,240","09:51,240","\"No, they are.\""]
["09:51,240","09:52,240","\"They're very much directed.\""]
