["00:15,500","00:16,500","\"That was perfect.\""]
["00:16,500","00:17,500","\"Do you think he's tall?\""]
["00:17,500","00:18,000","\"Yeah.\""]

["00:21,500","00:23,500","\"He's a hopper man.\""]
["00:23,500","00:26,500","\"That's the idea of no pool mats.\""]
["00:26,500","00:28,500","\"He tried to defend himself from being sonic.\""]
["00:28,500","00:30,500","\"He's almost all coming his face\""]
["00:30,500","00:36,860","\"Don't you remember me I made what we get angel now set to be free\""]
["00:36,860","00:46,700","\"It's just this fucking normal Japanese man\""]
["00:46,700","00:52,580","\"Leave Malone really yeah\""]
["00:52,580","00:56,660","\"He doesn't have any powers defend himself with\""]
["00:56,660","01:00,900","\"This game is a big range of big teams.\""]
["01:00,900","01:02,260","\"I don't like it.\""]
["01:02,260","01:03,460","\"What is a big range?\""]
["01:03,460","01:04,460","\"And what is it?\""]
["01:04,460","01:05,460","\"No such thing!\""]
["01:05,460","01:06,460","\"What is a big Tames?\""]
["01:06,460","01:08,660","\"Like the Tames River in here.\""]
["01:08,660","01:11,660","\"And why is the big range similar to the big Tames?\""]
["01:11,660","01:15,060","\"They're not just similar, it is a big Tames.\""]
["01:15,060","01:17,660","\"A big range is a big Tames.\""]
["01:17,660","01:18,660","\"The big Cooper.\""]

["01:20,860","01:23,060","\"What the fuck was that bullshit?\""]
["01:23,060","01:25,660","\"Mario's got a big C.\""]
["01:25,660","01:29,820","\"Big C. Man. I love that guy.\""]
["01:29,820","01:34,140","\"You should have a rap battle against Lady Gaga.\""]
["01:34,140","01:37,660","\"You just call her a geek.\""]
["01:37,660","01:41,860","\"A loser type of geek. And I found a lot.\""]
["01:41,860","01:45,460","\"No she really does suck though.\""]
["01:45,460","01:50,460","\"You know what he's talking about. I love that video.\""]
["01:50,460","01:54,260","\"Now we got a shortcut. Can you take it?\""]
["01:54,260","01:59,000","\"No, you just stay trapped in there forever. This is the bad ending\""]
["01:59,000","02:06,160","\"Chris would you get upset if you got in the cage and it just started going down forever\""]
["02:06,160","02:11,200","\"Like it a bit like you left the game for 15 minutes and you came back and it was still going down\""]
["02:11,200","02:17,180","\"That would be that would be hell Julian. You always asked me Chris. Would you hate this obviously terrible thing?\""]
["02:17,180","02:20,920","\"You gotta say Chris. What would you rather? I said, what would you do?\""]
["02:21,480","02:26,120","\"Okay, what would I do? What is your reaction? What would I do if I was going down in a case?\""]
["02:26,120","02:28,440","\"Not if you were in just in the game Chris if you're going down\""]
["02:28,440","02:34,040","\"I turn it off and I'd reset it. You're assuming it was a glitch. Yeah, what would you think it was?\""]
["02:34,040","02:37,640","\"A very artistic moment\""]
["02:37,640","02:43,320","\"An artistic moment. I if it were a different game. I'd probably assume it was for an artistic point\""]
["02:43,320","02:45,320","\"But since this is an action game\""]
["02:46,040","02:50,260","\"Even if it was for an artistic point like you're doing that for 15 minutes straight\""]
["02:50,260","02:53,740","\"I don't think anyone who's playing it is gonna sit there and be like that was\""]
["02:53,740","03:00,040","\"You know that actually had some oh hey, I like this man. That's that person who wants to come in and kill me\""]
["03:00,040","03:01,840","\"probably\""]
["03:01,840","03:05,480","\"Run maybe it's not oh the big man. Oh my god\""]
["03:05,480","03:08,200","\"It's the iron giant Julian\""]
["03:08,200","03:10,680","\"Jesus Christ\""]
["03:10,680","03:15,960","\"You've got himself a temper give them a spank you know a Mexico. It's called the iron jigante\""]
["03:15,960","03:20,960","\"You say take a quesadilla why don't you?\""]
["03:20,960","03:23,760","\"God damn it dude. How come he's not getting up?\""]
["03:23,760","03:27,240","\"Didn't we go somewhere and someone actually said quesadilla\""]
["03:27,240","03:36,140","\"Didn't we order food somewhere? I forget where I think that did happen. Yeah, Mario might be stinky, but I'm\""]
["03:36,140","03:38,960","\"stinky pinky with the big link\""]
["03:38,960","03:42,960","\"I like smashing things. It's fun.\""]
["03:42,960","03:44,960","\"Irontark is...\""]
["03:44,960","03:46,960","\"Are you gonna fight another monster?\""]
["03:46,960","03:48,960","\"You're the monster.\""]
["03:48,960","03:50,960","\"Yeah, we're the monster.\""]

["03:52,960","03:54,960","\"Here's another. Here's another...\""]
["03:54,960","03:58,960","\"Here's another really clever hypothetical. What would you do if you went through that\""]
["03:58,960","04:02,960","\"white mist and on the other side you saw the monster?\""]
["04:02,960","04:06,960","\"I'd run real quick. Like the monster's are scary.\""]
["04:06,960","04:11,920","\"pulls down his pants and says nice butt remember that and then he gets a little\""]
["04:11,920","04:17,360","\"boner because he knows she was looking at a little boner it's really tiny oh\""]
["04:17,360","04:25,880","\"hey look at this guy he's a big fool he's already he's pretty neat do you like\""]
["04:25,880","04:29,360","\"like he's not a monster or anything but I like the proportions I gave him it's\""]
["04:29,360","04:33,440","\"very inhuman yeah I like it what if Tiny Tiger was dressed up like that\""]
["04:33,440","04:36,080","\"Julian I'd be perfectly last night in the stream\""]
["04:36,080","04:38,480","\"Somebody said\""]
["04:38,480","04:44,720","\"What if tiny tiger was in a police uniform and I almost fainted really no I didn't that's an exaggeration\""]
["04:44,720","04:46,720","\"But I thought it was a fun idea\""]
["04:46,720","04:50,800","\"We'll be happy if he pulled you over\""]
["04:50,800","04:55,520","\"This guy's pretty easy. Yeah, he's not even moving\""]
["04:55,520","05:01,120","\"We're kicking his butt though. You say that after summoning someone. Oh, yeah, I\""]
["05:01,720","05:07,280","\"Don't know I want to blast through it. I don't really care that much Chris what what what?\""]
["05:07,280","05:10,040","\"What did I do?\""]
["05:10,040","05:14,840","\"You go through the fog door he's\""]
["05:14,840","05:19,860","\"That's that little cheerio. How did you get in here? How did you infiltrate my layer?\""]

["07:32,100","07:32,940","\"- Ah.\""]
["07:32,940","07:35,180","\"- What do you think it would do to people?\""]
["07:35,180","07:37,500","\"- It makes the seats comfortable.\""]
["07:37,500","07:39,140","\"So you sit on them and then it crushes you\""]
["07:39,140","07:40,700","\"into another seat.\""]
["07:40,700","07:42,140","\"- Which is also very comfortable.\""]
["07:42,140","07:43,940","\"- And then it turns you into holy water.\""]
["07:43,940","07:46,180","\"- How comfortable is that?\""]
["07:46,180","07:48,820","\"- Holy water.\""]
