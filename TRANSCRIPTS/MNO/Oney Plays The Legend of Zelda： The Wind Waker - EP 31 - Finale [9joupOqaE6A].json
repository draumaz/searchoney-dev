["05:57,920","06:03,300","\"This guy's talking about like all the evil shit when he's literally fucking like 200 of his cousins all at once\""]
["06:03,300","06:09,300","\"I know I feel I don't remember like any of this but he looks like he regrets it\""]
["06:09,300","06:12,240","\"I feel like I've seen so much sequence breaking of this game that I\""]

["06:46,360","06:50,760","\"Wow look on his face. They really cut her brain open. They could have been a different ending\""]
["06:50,760","06:58,160","\"Look at Ganon just beating the shit out with Todd learn. He's like, I'm so buff do not fear. I will not kill you\""]
["06:58,160","07:02,560","\"I merely have need of your death\""]

["11:16,980","11:18,980","\"Oh fuck!\""]
["11:18,980","11:20,980","\"I thought he was going to put a sword directly down in your head.\""]
["11:20,980","11:23,980","\"He just bit slept there. Holy shit. I'm not afraid of you.\""]
["11:23,980","11:28,980","\"Holy fuck. That's actually pretty damn cool. Imagine if a boss just became sentient and just murdered the fucking healer.\""]
["11:28,980","11:31,980","\"I got Grandma's suit.\""]

["12:01,480","12:06,400","\"God this is such a cool boss, but she's like, oh thank God you didn't stab me with the sword\""]
["12:06,400","12:12,720","\"That would have been fucking disgraceful. See Ganondorf's an asshole, but he's not like you know\""]
["12:12,720","12:17,920","\"He's he's still a gentleman. He's trying to kill you, but he's not gonna murder the person who's gonna murder him\""]
["12:17,920","12:25,080","\"You're so right. Oh, man. He's going on shit. Come on get over here\""]

["12:36,560","12:43,920","\"No, Zelda that's weird. I mean yeah, she shot me\""]
["12:43,920","12:50,560","\"Why does again just chill out you can just live in the happy peaceful world? It doesn't have to do this. What the hell's this problem?\""]
["12:50,560","12:53,120","\"I think he's tired of living in this is proper wasteland\""]
["12:53,120","12:56,160","\"But they're fixing it the King wish that it would be better\""]
["12:58,800","13:00,800","\"Oh no\""]
["13:00,800","13:08,480","\"You have to distract him are you ready I'll aim for your shield oh\""]
["13:08,480","13:14,960","\"Use your fucking shield she's gonna aim for you and you use the shield dude. That is awesome\""]
["13:14,960","13:17,440","\"I don't remember that at all actually. Oh shit\""]
["13:17,440","13:24,480","\"Whoa, I got a fairy - holy fuck why you did it as you died. That's incredible\""]
["13:24,480","13:29,280","\"That was so fucking cool. Yeah, holy shit. I think about this you fucking idiot\""]
["13:29,280","13:34,040","\"Just your blood spraying fucking violently like it's an anime\""]
["13:34,040","13:41,400","\"Link hit the exact smart center of his brain\""]
["13:41,400","13:46,920","\"Like sadly so deep he forgot the n-word\""]
["13:53,440","13:55,440","\"Rigamord is set in quick\""]
["13:55,440","14:01,300","\"You gotta lose your sword now it's stuck in the body of a man\""]
["14:01,300","14:05,680","\"That's kind of cool. That's someone ganks it out. He's like\""]
["14:05,680","14:15,040","\"That's like a bait worse than what happened to fucking Inuasha being paired against a tree as a fucking sword\""]
["14:15,040","14:19,320","\"Staff to his brain by Joe Drake. He's just a rock now. He doesn't exist anymore\""]
["14:19,320","14:22,440","\"he has regret and\""]
["14:22,440","14:26,440","\"And he washes he could do things over.\""]
["14:26,440","14:29,440","\"But Dark Forces keep him alive.\""]
["14:29,440","14:35,440","\"He's like, \"\"You thought you killed the last person on Earth who knew the N-word, but you're wrong. I know it too.\""]
["14:35,440","14:41,440","\"And I'm gonna say it. And then you'll know it too. And then I'm gonna tell everybody. And I'm gonna make it rain it.\"\"\""]
["14:41,440","14:48,440","\"That would be a good ending to a game. It's like all memory of the N-word vanish. Thanks to you.\""]
["14:48,440","14:54,680","\"Wow, wow we forgot it too.\""]
["14:54,680","14:58,520","\"Now my children go out and cancel everyone.\""]
["14:58,520","15:02,160","\"It's just a montage of canceling Ganon's monsters.\""]
["15:02,160","15:05,320","\"Is there any other guys there at the bottom of the ocean?\""]
["15:05,320","15:11,760","\"They should definitely call it that for the next game, the cancel arrow.\""]
["15:11,760","15:15,160","\"Just change the light arrow to Kataka.\""]
["15:15,160","15:17,160","\"*laughing*\""]
["15:17,160","15:22,600","\"The Kentucky area. The Kentucky area. That's a nice little little rollback to anyone who plays video games.\""]
["15:22,600","15:24,600","\"I hope no one fires what it means!\""]
["15:24,600","15:29,320","\"It's like you're fine. Come with us you old fucking ghost man.\""]
