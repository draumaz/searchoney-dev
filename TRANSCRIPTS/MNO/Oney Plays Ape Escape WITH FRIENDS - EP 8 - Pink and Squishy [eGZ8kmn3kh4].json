["09:02,240","09:06,340","\"Did I already tell the story about the pizza what on the show?\""]
["09:06,340","09:09,020","\"Did what's the pizza story? It's not it's not that great of a story\""]
["09:09,020","09:15,100","\"But it's one of the few things that I remember from being very very young was the first time that\""]
["09:15,100","09:21,860","\"But I guess I learned just to fucking put shit in your mouth instead of making a little\""]
["09:21,860","09:24,780","\"bitch about it.\""]
["09:24,780","09:29,420","\"There was this one period I was like three or four where I refused.\""]
["09:29,420","09:35,460","\"I was just like, \"\"Hey, if I want pizza, I'm just going to refuse to eat anything but pizza.\"\"\""]
["09:35,460","09:38,220","\"And so my parents were like, \"\"No, you have to eat actual food.\""]
["09:38,220","09:41,660","\"You can't just have pizza.\"\"\""]
["09:41,660","09:46,580","\"And so I just refused any food that they gave me for three old days.\""]
["09:46,580","09:49,460","\"Obviously, you can't go that long without eating.\""]
["09:49,460","09:55,140","\"And so after three days of me going on hunger strike for pizza, they were finally like,\""]
["09:55,140","09:57,140","\"\"\"Okay, Jesus, we'll get your pizza.\"\"\""]
["09:57,140","10:00,900","\"If you fucking eat.\""]
["10:00,900","10:05,580","\"But then they were like, \"\"Okay, the stipulation is you have to have a little bit of salad\""]
["10:05,580","10:07,380","\"before you eat your pizza.\"\"\""]
["10:07,380","10:11,020","\"And I ended up being so hungry that I just ate the whole thing of salad.\""]
["10:11,020","10:13,020","\"I never ate the pizza\""]
["10:13,020","10:18,060","\"That sucks. And so that's how I learned Julie want to hear funny story kind of similar not to be a jerk go ahead\""]
["10:18,060","10:21,780","\"It's not starving or nothing, but there's a video tape of me somewhere at home\""]
["10:21,780","10:29,380","\"Where I'm like I'm like sitting on a chair pouting really hard and crying and my mom's like what's wrong with you Chris? I'm like\""]
["10:29,380","10:34,580","\"Daddy would you buy me a super speech?\""]
["10:34,580","10:36,580","\"I'm saying it like that.\""]
["10:36,580","10:38,580","\"Adam crying.\""]
["10:38,580","10:40,580","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:40,580","10:42,580","\"And I just keep saying it over.\""]
["10:42,580","10:45,580","\"He wouldn't buy me a super speech.\""]
["10:45,580","10:47,580","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:47,580","10:49,580","\"It's really funny.\""]
["10:49,580","10:51,580","\"That is funny. I wish I could see that video.\""]
["10:51,580","10:54,580","\"There's a video of my sister where she's holding a spoon up to my mom.\""]
["10:54,580","10:57,580","\"She's like, \"\"Look at yourself in the mirror, Daddy.\"\"\""]
["10:57,580","10:58,580","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:58,580","11:00,580","\"Why did you both talk like idiots?\""]
["11:00,580","11:01,580","\"I don't know.\""]
["11:01,580","11:02,580","\"It's like a children.\""]
["11:02,580","11:04,580","\"It's like a banger Irish accent.\""]
