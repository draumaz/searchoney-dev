["08:49,100","08:49,940","\"- What?\""]
["08:49,940","08:52,900","\"- The idea of like forcing animals to have tattoos,\""]
["08:52,900","08:55,340","\"like you have to strap them down\""]
["08:55,340","08:56,900","\"and you start poking them with the needle.\""]
["08:56,900","08:57,740","\"- It's cool though.\""]
["08:57,740","09:00,460","\"Have you ever given your dog an eye tattoo?\""]

["09:06,180","09:07,900","\"- No, no, no, you grab the white of their eye\""]
["09:07,900","09:10,300","\"and you tattoo it so it's black so it looks scary.\""]
["09:11,700","09:17,120","\"Say spooky pooch. This is the one time I really hate the camera because it goes diagonal to make this harder\""]
["09:17,120","09:23,460","\"This level is dropping frames - well, yeah, it does run slower because this is big. Oh, yeah, it's very big\""]
["09:23,460","09:28,100","\"What is this some kind of joke what fuck?\""]
["09:28,100","09:35,200","\"Expecting me to play games turns into a slump when it's tilted. This is really and it doesn't work so good\""]
["09:35,200","09:40,620","\"Yeah, what if Mario was dead\""]
["09:40,620","09:43,620","\"That would be the best story I ever read.\""]

["10:00,620","10:03,620","\"He's fat and he has a mustache, that's all it takes.\""]
["10:03,620","10:06,620","\"Julian, I would be furious if he wore a Gaelic t-shirt.\""]
