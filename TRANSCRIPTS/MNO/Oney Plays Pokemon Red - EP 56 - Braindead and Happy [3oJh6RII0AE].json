["00:10,920","00:12,240","\"Did I whip you up a--\""]
["00:12,240","00:13,080","\"- Then I'll whip you up a stick.\""]
["00:13,080","00:16,460","\"- Stick off your butt, you gonna wump up a pokemon league.\""]
["00:16,460","00:17,300","\"Come on!\""]
["00:17,300","00:19,360","\"- Okay.\""]
["00:19,360","00:20,360","\"- We're gonna fight him now.\""]
["00:20,360","00:21,400","\"- Hey, that's Gary.\""]
["00:21,400","00:22,240","\"- What?\""]
["00:22,240","00:23,900","\"- Dude, it's true, it is.\""]
["00:23,900","00:24,740","\"- Aww.\""]
["00:24,740","00:25,580","\"- Look, he means business this time.\""]
["00:25,580","00:26,660","\"- Aww, he's so beautiful.\""]
["00:26,660","00:28,100","\"- He's gonna throw that rock at me.\""]
["00:28,100","00:28,940","\"- Good.\""]
["00:28,940","00:31,140","\"What kind of badge do you think he has on his jacket there?\""]
["00:31,140","00:33,940","\"Police Officer badge.\""]
["00:33,940","00:35,440","\"Holy shit, you're leveled, ain't you?\""]
["00:35,440","00:40,140","\"He became the sheriff because he shot the deputy repeatedly.\""]
["00:40,140","00:43,140","\"Gary would do that. He's cold blooded.\""]
["00:43,140","00:45,340","\"Maybe game Gary.\""]
["00:45,340","00:49,640","\"I think anime Gary would probably be too cowardly.\""]
["00:49,640","00:51,340","\"Was he cowardly?\""]
["00:51,340","00:53,240","\"He didn't do anything.\""]
["00:53,240","00:54,940","\"All he did was ride around in his car.\""]
["00:54,940","00:56,040","\"He had a car?\""]
["00:56,040","00:56,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:56,840","00:59,800","\"He had a car and like 15 beautiful girls hanging off him all the time.\""]
["00:59,800","01:01,080","\"That doesn't sound cowardly to me.\""]
["01:01,080","01:02,520","\"That sounds like the perfect light.\""]
["01:02,520","01:03,520","\"Heh heh heh.\""]
["01:03,520","01:06,360","\"I'm saying he didn't do shit, like he didn't do Pokemon stuff.\""]
["01:06,360","01:09,200","\"He did lots of stuff, he vandalized the one sign, remember?\""]
["01:09,200","01:11,280","\"To say that Ash was a loser.\""]
["01:11,280","01:13,920","\"And a geek and a suuuuuck.\""]
["01:13,920","01:15,680","\"And then everyone started calling him a slut.\""]
["01:15,680","01:18,280","\"I wonder if that's still there, I had a friend.\""]
["01:18,280","01:21,240","\"I had a friend grow up.\""]
["01:21,240","01:25,800","\"And I wrote Gary was here, Ash was a loser up in his attic.\""]
["01:25,800","01:27,240","\"I don't know if that's still there or not.\""]
["01:27,240","01:28,240","\"I would watch that.\""]
["01:28,240","01:29,080","\"Probably not, I think.\""]
["01:29,080","01:29,580","\"No.\""]
["01:29,580","01:30,580","\"The house is still there.\""]
["01:30,580","01:33,400","\"It got remodeled or something.\""]
["01:33,400","01:34,840","\"I don't know.\""]
["01:34,840","01:37,120","\"If that was the main conflict in Pokemon,\""]
["01:37,120","01:41,600","\"was that Gary told everyone to call Ash a slut,\""]
["01:41,600","01:44,160","\"that would be really fucking good.\""]
["01:44,160","01:46,600","\"I mean, he already tells them to do everything else to him.\""]
["01:46,600","01:48,000","\"Call him a slut, everybody.\""]
["01:48,000","01:49,640","\"Nah!\""]
["01:49,640","01:50,600","\"Call him Gary.\""]
["01:50,600","01:51,760","\"That'll really mess with him.\""]
["01:51,760","01:53,200","\"I'm not a slut!\""]
["01:53,200","01:55,040","\"I'm going to start dressing up as him.\""]
["01:55,040","01:56,040","\"I'm not going to kill me!\""]
["01:56,040","01:57,040","\"He's got me!\""]
["01:57,040","01:58,040","\"Ash!\""]
["01:58,040","01:59,040","\"That'll really screw with him!\""]
["01:59,040","02:00,040","\"What?!\""]
["02:00,040","02:02,040","\"What the fuck?\""]
["02:02,040","02:03,040","\"This shit!\""]
["02:03,040","02:05,040","\"That could be a series.\""]
["02:05,040","02:09,040","\"Ash will wake up every day and people just do things to screw with them mentally.\""]
["02:09,040","02:12,040","\"Did you see that kind of uh, the put them in a new house?\""]
["02:12,040","02:13,040","\"It has more adult.\""]
["02:13,040","02:16,040","\"It was like a Pokemon series where it's like it follows the game more.\""]
["02:16,040","02:18,040","\"Yeah, Pokemon origins or whatever it was called.\""]
["02:18,040","02:19,040","\"Yeah, I remember.\""]
["02:19,040","02:23,040","\"And at the start you can see Squirtle getting bit on the face really hard.\""]
["02:23,040","02:25,040","\"*screams*\""]
["02:25,040","02:27,040","\"*screams*\""]
["02:27,040","02:29,040","\"*screams*\""]
["02:29,040","02:31,040","\"*screams*\""]
["02:31,040","02:35,040","\"I remember everybody was very impressed, they were like \"\"Pokemon's finally dark and for adults\"\"\""]
["02:35,040","02:37,040","\"and I was like \"\"Shut up, it doesn't matter\"\"\""]
["02:37,040","02:41,040","\"Hey, hey, that's cynical, hey\""]
["02:41,040","02:43,040","\"I'm a cynical man\""]
["02:43,040","02:46,040","\"I've led a long life of people being shitty to me\""]
["02:46,040","02:47,040","\"Hey!\""]
["02:47,040","02:48,040","\"Wow Julie, yeah!\""]
["02:48,040","02:49,040","\"That's true!\""]
["02:49,040","02:51,040","\"That's why I feel the way I do about things\""]
["02:51,040","02:52,040","\"That's fair\""]
["02:52,040","02:55,440","\"He's standing on the stank though, you gotta admit that.\""]
["02:55,440","02:57,520","\"It's true, Gillian. Think about it.\""]
["02:57,520","02:59,800","\"I really like Alakazam's sprite.\""]
["02:59,800","03:03,280","\"I think it looks really cool, that's a good pose.\""]
["03:03,280","03:04,560","\"Uh oh.\""]
["03:04,560","03:06,520","\"[whimpering]\""]
["03:06,520","03:08,800","\"Leed seed was sucked out of Alakazam.\""]
["03:08,800","03:10,600","\"Little stank might have just died, did...\""]
["03:10,600","03:13,040","\"Nooooooo.\""]
["03:13,040","03:15,960","\"Goo-lo, come back.\""]
["03:15,960","03:18,240","\"Oh no, you're choosing a shitty head.\""]
["03:18,240","03:21,800","\"Excuse me, this big shitty kitty can do this.\""]
["03:21,800","03:28,800","\"the all your dead die die goodbye oh my god it's because he's poison yep and\""]
["03:28,800","03:32,720","\"beautiful maybe maybe it wasn't a good idea to make almost everything in this\""]
["03:32,720","03:38,800","\"game poison it's true they really liked poison in this generation that's fair\""]
["03:38,800","03:45,200","\"I'm poison what type of what we're gonna do what poison am I revivable to\""]
["03:45,200","03:52,840","\"What do you say? Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm revivable to deep sea eel poison\""]
["03:52,840","03:58,060","\"Why is that because my father fought them for his whole year?\""]
["03:58,060","04:03,160","\"Here in the thousand-year war thousand eel war\""]
["04:03,160","04:08,200","\"Imagine a thousand eels circling you that would be very scary\""]
["04:09,600","04:11,600","\"Morails, Morails are fuckin' scary.\""]
["04:11,600","04:13,600","\"I think that many seals could... seals.\""]
["04:13,600","04:14,100","\"Eels.\""]
["04:14,100","04:16,100","\"That many eels could probably bite you to death.\""]
["04:16,100","04:16,600","\"No.\""]
["04:16,600","04:18,600","\"Did you just see how much that did?\""]
["04:18,600","04:19,600","\"Whoa.\""]

["04:20,600","04:21,600","\"That's his poison!\""]

["04:22,100","04:22,600","\"Who's poison?\""]
["04:22,600","04:23,600","\"That's unfortunate luck.\""]

["04:30,100","04:32,100","\"Oh, just killed him in one hit.\""]
["04:32,100","04:35,100","\"Unfortunately, you can't depend on Max Goof either because...\""]
["04:35,100","04:36,100","\"Oh, whoops.\""]
["04:36,100","04:38,100","\"The weaknesses are inverted in this one.\""]
["04:38,100","04:39,100","\"You're out of revivies.\""]
["04:39,100","04:41,100","\"Yeah, no, we got one more.\""]
["04:41,100","04:46,500","\"Please, please, dearie, please use a potion on him.\""]
["04:46,500","04:49,500","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["04:49,500","04:51,500","\"I got another one too.\""]
["04:51,500","04:54,500","\"It's just a matter of getting lucky with this right now.\""]

["05:03,700","05:05,700","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["05:05,700","05:07,700","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["05:07,700","05:14,700","\"Is this song gonna be remembered in like a hundred years? Are people gonna sing the song and not know it was from?\""]
["05:14,700","05:16,700","\"Probably not.\""]
["05:16,700","05:20,700","\"The anime versions of this music is really good too.\""]
["05:20,700","05:32,700","\"I miss. It was really exciting. Once I, I think when I started watching Pok√©mon, I had never played the games, but once I did it was always really exciting to recognize like, \"\"Oh, that's a song from the game!\"\"\""]
["05:32,700","05:36,100","\"It's being played by real instruments instead of a Game Boy speaker.\""]
["05:36,100","05:37,100","\"It's so cool.\""]
["05:37,100","05:40,900","\"It was like reported with a really cool orchestra and a rock band.\""]
["05:40,900","05:41,400","\"It's true.\""]
["05:41,400","05:44,500","\"I had an interesting sound to it too.\""]
["05:44,500","05:45,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:45,000","05:49,400","\"It wasn't just like, I don't know, rearranged in the same way,\""]
["05:49,400","05:53,500","\"but with instruments, they actually like put a fun spin on it.\""]
["05:53,500","05:55,500","\"I love that kind of music.\""]
["05:55,500","05:58,900","\"Do you... when did you...\""]
["05:58,900","06:01,000","\"How do you feel about O.C. remix, Chris?\""]
["06:01,000","06:02,000","\"I mean, the website.\""]
["06:02,000","06:02,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:02,500","06:04,180","\"Do you like the stuff that they do there?\""]
["06:04,180","06:05,940","\"Not usually at all.\""]
["06:05,940","06:07,540","\"It's... I feel the same way.\""]
["06:07,540","06:08,980","\"It's usually too different.\""]
["06:08,980","06:14,340","\"It's usually like they take a little inspiration and make something entirely new and I just don't care.\""]
["06:14,340","06:16,260","\"I sometimes like them.\""]
["06:16,260","06:17,940","\"But sometimes they get a good one.\""]
["06:17,940","06:21,460","\"I look for me. It's just the styles of music that they go for.\""]
["06:21,460","06:23,780","\"It's just not generally the kind of thing I like to listen to.\""]
["06:23,780","06:30,820","\"I enjoy like when people put...\""]
["06:30,820","06:33,040","\"I like putting it in a different genre.\""]
["06:33,040","06:36,040","\"- Yeah. - Like take this theme and like,\""]
["06:36,040","06:38,200","\"I don't know, make it, don't do metal,\""]
["06:38,200","06:40,640","\"'cause everybody does metal, but like,\""]
["06:40,640","06:42,400","\"I don't know, do smooth jazz.\""]
["06:42,400","06:43,740","\"- Oh, you beat me a battery.\""]
["06:43,740","06:44,740","\"- It's Pokemon Battle theme.\""]
["06:44,740","06:45,580","\"- You're just saying that,\""]
["06:45,580","06:46,480","\"\"\"Negasmooth Jazz\"\" is your favorite.\""]
["06:46,480","06:47,380","\"It's not my favorite.\""]
["06:47,380","06:48,840","\"- I think I just like it a lot.\""]
["06:48,840","06:52,180","\"- I can't really get into new music\""]
["06:52,180","06:55,480","\"unless it like moved or affected me in some way.\""]
["06:55,480","06:57,720","\"Like if I saw it in a movie or a game\""]
["06:57,720","06:59,760","\"and it suited it really good,\""]
["06:59,760","07:01,440","\"That's usually when I get into a song.\""]
["07:01,440","07:03,760","\"Can you make any music recommendations?\""]
["07:03,760","07:05,900","\"Is there anyone you've listened to recently?\""]
["07:05,900","07:07,400","\"Recently?\""]
["07:07,400","07:08,880","\"No, I've just been...\""]
["07:08,880","07:11,760","\"I've been listening to the same shit for the last 10 years.\""]
["07:11,760","07:12,760","\"Oh.\""]
["07:12,760","07:13,360","\"It's...\""]
["07:13,360","07:14,320","\"You gotta look around.\""]
["07:14,320","07:14,880","\"Kind of sick of it.\""]
["07:14,880","07:16,560","\"You gotta look around real hard now.\""]
["07:16,560","07:17,560","\"I just don't...\""]
["07:17,560","07:18,360","\"I'm not...\""]
["07:18,360","07:19,600","\"Like I said, I just...\""]
["07:19,600","07:21,360","\"I don't think I've signed it hard to get into stuff.\""]
["07:21,360","07:22,960","\"DJ Khaled.\""]
["07:22,960","07:26,560","\"There'll be like new games or movies that come out and I'll get into them.\""]
["07:26,560","07:29,240","\"Um...\""]
["07:29,240","07:35,240","\"I got really upset with the Lion King soundtrack recently.\""]
["07:35,240","07:38,240","\"You seem to really like movie soundtracks.\""]
["07:38,240","07:39,240","\"Yeah, you do.\""]
["07:39,240","07:42,240","\"Because that's sort of a style you want to go for too, right?\""]
["07:42,240","07:44,240","\"Yeah. I like that stuff.\""]
["07:44,240","07:47,240","\"Check out my SoundCloud. I make lots of music there.\""]
["07:47,240","07:50,240","\"That's the kind of music I like. It's because I make it.\""]
["07:50,240","07:52,240","\"What are your favorites from the Lion King soundtrack?\""]
["07:52,240","07:56,240","\"I really like, I think one of the songs is called,\""]
["07:56,240","07:58,060","\"I was trying to be brave like you.\""]
["07:58,060","07:59,920","\"- Oh, that's a really good song.\""]
["07:59,920","08:01,480","\"- I don't remember the track listings.\""]
["08:01,480","08:02,800","\"I had the CD when I was a kid,\""]
["08:02,800","08:03,840","\"but I don't remember any of them.\""]
["08:03,840","08:08,840","\"I remember Elton John doing songs for the end credits.\""]
["08:08,840","08:11,520","\"He composed everything, yeah?\""]
["08:11,520","08:13,360","\"- Him and Hans Zimmer was that movie?\""]
["08:13,360","08:14,200","\"- Okay.\""]
["08:14,200","08:15,640","\"- That is a good Hans Zimmer soundtrack.\""]
["08:15,640","08:17,640","\"I'll cut the Manson slack.\""]
["08:17,640","08:19,160","\"He can do good soundtracks.\""]
["08:19,160","08:22,120","\"It was that, it was when Superman,\""]
["08:22,120","08:23,360","\"oh, his man of steel came out.\""]
["08:23,360","08:25,920","\"I was like, okay, he fucking sucked now.\""]
