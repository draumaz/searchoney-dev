["09:16,640","09:19,480","\"I think it just does the voices it leaves it alone\""]
["09:19,480","09:24,320","\"It's possible I doubt that he actually reviews the full episodes with ixity editing\""]
["09:24,320","09:26,920","\"I mean I could be totally wrong about that, but I mean\""]
["09:26,920","09:31,960","\"There's episodes of only plays that you haven't seen right like probably I\""]
