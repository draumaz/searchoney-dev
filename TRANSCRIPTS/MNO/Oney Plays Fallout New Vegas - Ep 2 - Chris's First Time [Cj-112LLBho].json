["08:46,940","08:48,220","\"And we were like, \"\"No, that's okay.\"\"\""]
["08:48,220","08:53,220","\"And then, um, we did what we did want to go to a strip club, but what happened was, uh,\""]
["08:53,220","08:56,140","\"we were like, \"\"Let's just get an Uber because these guys are scary.\"\"\""]
["08:56,140","09:01,420","\"But then, another one of those guys came up and, uh, he was being, like, really pushy, too.\""]
["09:01,420","09:03,580","\"And he was like, \"\"Where you guys going?\"\"\""]
["09:03,580","09:07,020","\"And we were just like, \"\"Uh, to a strip club, we're just gonna get this Uber, though thank you.\"\"\""]
["09:07,020","09:11,660","\"And he was like, \"\"What? No! What? No, I can get you there for free!\"\"\""]
["09:11,660","09:15,340","\"We're like no no. Thank you. Bye bye. He's like you fucking idiot\""]

["09:20,760","09:24,940","\"You know there's something wrong. No, they say he was scary and he had a ponytail a promoter\""]
["09:24,940","09:27,900","\"He works for every body. He gets in it. He gets paid for everybody\""]
["09:27,900","09:31,420","\"He he personally gets into the club. Oh, now something else after me\""]
["09:31,420","09:35,180","\"But what happened was we were getting into the uber and he was screaming at us and he was like running at us\""]
["09:35,180","09:40,020","\"We were all like this is scary. Oh, oh, it's a cousin door bats bats\""]
["09:40,500","09:45,980","\"Those things will fuck you up bad - really yeah, okay. They're actually probably stronger than the scorpions\""]
["09:45,980","09:50,480","\"What what fuck dude? Oh my god, dude?\""]
["09:50,480","09:56,820","\"What this game is too fucking hard? No, it's I think this is all to prevent you from going toward in the direction of Vegas too early\""]
["09:56,820","09:58,820","\"You're really not supposed to damn\""]
["09:58,820","10:00,740","\"These things are tough\""]
["10:00,740","10:04,340","\"Yeah, what the hell look at this shit you low on health dead dude\""]
["10:04,340","10:09,340","\"Is this a good idea? I don't know if we're supposed to head to Vegas. Okay?\""]
["10:09,660","10:14,300","\"You try to in some quests near bottom damn. Let's not go that way\""]
["10:14,300","10:18,480","\"You do I mean like with the ride sure I'm it's a car\""]
["10:18,480","10:23,180","\"But like why would you ever want to get into a car with the stranger who's like screaming at you to get in their car?\""]
["10:23,180","10:26,120","\"Yeah, but when we were doing no scenario that makes sense\""]
["10:26,120","10:31,500","\"Well, we were getting into the uber that he was screaming at us and following us and then Veronica just stuck her head out of the car\""]
["10:31,500","10:33,500","\"And was like cut your ponytail you\""]
["10:36,380","10:39,780","\"He looked like he was going to murder her like he looks so fucking scary\""]
["10:39,780","10:44,020","\"But it was funny. She's gonna get into trouble one day baby\""]
["10:44,020","10:50,460","\"Maybe maybe your baby, so I guess there's probably little quests down here, huh? Yeah\""]
["10:50,460","10:57,800","\"Hit up the town hit up Trudy. She probably wants you to get rid of some rats probably watch me to head up to booty\""]
["10:57,800","11:01,020","\"I got five rats in my basement. I really need some help getting rid of that\""]
["11:01,020","11:02,780","\"You think you can handle that with your vermin shooter\""]
["11:02,780","11:08,840","\"This is why I've never started games like this in a long time. The first few hours is always like kill the rats\""]
["11:08,840","11:13,660","\"Yeah, and then the scavenger guy is gonna be like hey listen, I'm getting kind of old\""]
["11:13,660","11:18,060","\"But there happens to be a warehouse out on the outskirts of town. Maybe you can pick me up a\""]
["11:18,060","11:20,100","\"CPU or two yeah\""]
["11:20,100","11:24,940","\"Like if you ever tried playing World of Warcraft the first like 10 levels in that game is like mmm\""]
["11:24,940","11:29,420","\"Go kill bars in the woods. It's like how do people sit through that? I don't understand\""]
["11:29,420","11:35,860","\"I used to love that stuff when I was younger and had a lot of patience and time. Yeah, you could have shortened that to when I was stupid\""]
