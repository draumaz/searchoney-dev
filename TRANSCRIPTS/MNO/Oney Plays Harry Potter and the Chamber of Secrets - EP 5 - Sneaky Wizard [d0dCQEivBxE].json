["01:04,360","01:06,360","\"They didn't show me in the fourth film.\""]
["01:06,360","01:08,240","\"That would have been a cool sight.\""]

["01:11,480","01:15,160","\"This is just the practice for the oncoming competition.\""]
["01:15,160","01:17,080","\"It's very nice because you're a mudblood.\""]

["01:22,760","01:23,760","\"I'm not sure about that though.\""]
["01:23,760","01:24,760","\"Might be wrong.\""]
["01:24,760","01:25,760","\"Okay.\""]
["01:25,760","01:26,760","\"Both Lillian and James.\""]

["01:38,640","01:48,800","\"-You do! -Yeah! Yay! -Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! -It's actually kind of feel bad for Petunia because as a kid, Lily gets to go to Hogwarts that she doesn't.\""]
["01:48,800","01:57,640","\"It's like the meanest shit ever. -Wait, who's Petunia? -Lily's sister. Harry's aunt. -You seem to be great at distinction. And because of that excellent performance, Harry, here's a brand new song.\""]

["02:17,400","02:18,920","\"I\""]
["02:18,920","02:26,080","\"Am kind of curious as to like there has to be a big open world Hogwarts section or it'll just be doing loading screens every second\""]

["02:31,240","02:35,920","\"party guys see me win but I love putty honesome hmm Harry you're a disgrace to\""]
["02:35,920","02:41,000","\"the house it was embarrassing to watch fucking wrong\""]

["02:51,800","02:52,800","\"Oh, cool.\""]
["02:52,800","02:56,800","\"I mean, that's true.\""]
["02:56,800","02:58,800","\"She is kind of a mudblood in that regard.\""]
["02:58,800","03:00,800","\"It's better than everyone else.\""]
["03:00,800","03:03,800","\"Anyway, it's a horrible thing to say.\""]
["03:03,800","03:06,800","\"If that's been the hybrid showing up, I'd have cursed him.\""]
["03:06,800","03:08,800","\"Doesn't seem that hard.\""]

["03:11,800","03:14,600","\"I mean, it sounds more like a child's insult.\""]
["03:14,600","03:16,600","\"If they were called a scumb blood, then I would get it.\""]
["03:16,600","03:18,800","\"I'd be like, \"\"You're f--\"\" That's kind of mean.\""]
["03:18,800","03:20,800","\"I got scumbed in my blood.\""]
["03:20,800","03:23,100","\"I guess Mudbud is like calling someone a bastard.\""]
["03:23,100","03:25,100","\"I mean, you're a bastard, so fuck you.\""]
["03:25,100","03:26,700","\"But it's like wizard version of bastard,\""]

["03:42,300","03:43,700","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["03:43,700","03:45,200","\"Yeah, look, I didn't know you could do that.\""]

["03:53,180","03:55,880","\"Dude, this is what I remember. This is fucking sick.\""]
["03:55,880","03:57,080","\"It's a ring mini game.\""]
["03:57,080","03:59,000","\"It's pretty amazing they had this in this game.\""]
["03:59,000","04:00,000","\"That is pretty cool.\""]
["04:00,000","04:04,720","\"Oh god, it just beans.\""]
["04:04,720","04:06,440","\"It's beans hovering in the sky.\""]
["04:06,440","04:08,720","\"Dude, you can fly all the fuck around Hogwarts now.\""]
["04:08,720","04:10,520","\"Can you land on top and get some secrets?\""]
["04:10,520","04:13,080","\"Go through the portrait and find the secret Yoshi.\""]
["04:13,080","04:14,280","\"What's water room in here?\""]
["04:14,280","04:16,800","\"Shit, you can't. Can you stop flying and walk on the roof?\""]
["04:16,800","04:18,160","\"Um, no.\""]
["04:18,160","04:20,200","\"You can definitely get off at certain points,\""]
["04:20,200","04:21,200","\"But I guess not here.\""]
["04:21,200","04:22,200","\"Wait, go up higher.\""]
["04:22,200","04:23,800","\"Like go all the way up.\""]
["04:23,800","04:25,680","\"You mean, like look up there.\""]
["04:25,680","04:26,840","\"Ooh, what's this red ring?\""]
["04:26,840","04:27,840","\"Red ring.\""]

["04:31,680","04:34,280","\"Can you go on the roof?\""]
["04:34,280","04:38,040","\"You can look right in this window and see Hermione changing.\""]
["04:38,040","04:39,040","\"That specific window.\""]
["04:39,040","04:41,240","\"Oh, you in there.\""]
["04:41,240","04:43,240","\"So rude.\""]
["04:43,240","04:46,680","\"Imagine what that looked like from inside the window.\""]
["04:46,680","04:49,160","\"I must have hit a magical barrier.\""]
["04:49,160","04:50,160","\"How clever.\""]
["04:50,160","04:54,440","\"very yep go for the blue one that's a new ring there's a blue ring down below\""]
["04:54,440","04:58,160","\"I think this is a little different to the PlayStation version I don't remember\""]
["04:58,160","05:03,880","\"it like this how the fuck did you get my first time doing said fucking\""]
["05:03,880","05:11,320","\"said fucking be swim deep oh wow they actually have a particle effect that's\""]

["05:16,480","05:17,480","\"Neville long-time.\""]
["05:17,480","05:18,480","\"Neville.\""]
["05:18,480","05:24,000","\"I wish there was a penalty for smacking in the things.\""]
["05:24,000","05:25,000","\"This is pretty cool.\""]
["05:25,000","05:26,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:26,000","05:27,000","\"I wish the penalty was death.\""]
["05:27,000","05:32,840","\"Yeah, I would love to see the small child ragdoll down the side of the hill.\""]
["05:32,840","05:36,800","\"Can someone please, please, please rip every single model from this game, including the\""]
["05:36,800","05:38,960","\"environment so we can just do it in Blender?\""]
["05:38,960","05:40,800","\"Thank you for your sure.\""]
["05:40,800","05:41,800","\"No one has.\""]
["05:41,800","05:42,800","\"Yeah, no.\""]
["05:42,800","05:43,800","\"I was actually checking it out recently.\""]
["05:43,800","05:48,800","\"I made the thumbnail. I got Harry's model from this game off the models resource.\""]
["05:48,800","05:53,800","\"You could probably imply like reverse kinematics or whatever. What's it called?\""]
["05:53,800","05:59,800","\"When they're feet and first kinematics is when you want their like hand or foot to stick to something properly.\""]
["05:59,800","06:05,800","\"Okay, that's not what I meant. I just meant ragdoll. I was trying to sound smart, but I don't know anything about 3D.\""]
["06:05,800","06:10,800","\"How do you get off? B. Maybe you have to be in the area.\""]
["06:10,800","06:13,800","\"Oh, you think I can't get off here because I'm not supposed to walk around here?\""]
["06:13,800","06:15,300","\"Yeah, you can probably do it here.\""]
["06:15,300","06:15,900","\"Hit B.\""]
["06:15,900","06:17,300","\"Go more close to him.\""]
["06:17,300","06:18,300","\"There you go.\""]
["06:18,300","06:18,800","\"See?\""]
["06:18,800","06:19,800","\"Weird.\""]
["06:19,800","06:21,300","\"That's strange.\""]
["06:21,300","06:23,300","\"It's weird.\""]
["06:23,300","06:23,800","\"You know what?\""]
["06:23,800","06:25,300","\"Okay, now I'm confused, Chris.\""]
["06:25,300","06:30,300","\"Why is it that you teleport incredibly fast to the next area instead of being able to run?\""]
["06:30,300","06:32,300","\"But you can fly over those areas.\""]
["06:32,300","06:32,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:32,300","06:35,400","\"I mean, I think that's all to do with how they had to design this game.\""]
["06:35,400","06:38,000","\"So you could do that without it breaking everything.\""]
["06:38,000","06:40,200","\"They should have just given you the broom from the get-go.\""]
["06:40,200","06:40,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:40,700","06:45,580","\"You had a broom to begin with, yeah, it just wasn't as good as the broom handle 2000.\""]
["06:45,580","06:49,740","\"I guess you end the day, right? Your day's done. Yeah.\""]
["06:49,740","06:51,900","\"Huh, your parents are crazy.\""]
["06:51,900","07:01,420","\"I'm well aware they're crazy. I live with my grandmother.\""]
["07:01,420","07:04,380","\"Well, that was good.\""]
["07:04,380","07:06,860","\"Is it that Neville's parents are Death Eaters or something?\""]
["07:06,860","07:09,180","\"No, they were tortured by Bellatrix LaStrange.\""]
["07:09,180","07:15,780","\"Oh, she went crazy. Mmm, and they never got better. Oh, there you go nice\""]
["07:15,780","07:21,680","\"40 points it kind of looks like the line. Oh, you got 40 points. You got more than 40 points\""]
["07:21,680","07:27,780","\"You must have got some extra credit when you did the fuck her catch and all those snitches. Oh God. They're winning\""]
["07:27,780","07:33,820","\"Wait, yeah, what I think they're dial clocked up\""]
["07:38,220","07:41,960","\"Yeah, it goes past it. That's so weird. Yeah the last\""]
