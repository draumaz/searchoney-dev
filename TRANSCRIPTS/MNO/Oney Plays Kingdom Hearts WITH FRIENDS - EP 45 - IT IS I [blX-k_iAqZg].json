["00:14,540","00:20,180","\"Remember some of our teachers. You said that's why there's so many fucking videos of like teachers losing the shit\""]
["00:20,180","00:24,480","\"No, those are really common our class. Did ever tell you about the system for our school?\""]
["00:24,480","00:29,120","\"Where like the entry tests and shit never tell you that no our school was like\""]
["00:29,860","00:35,560","\"Before you go into high school, you do an entry exam, and then they sort you into classes based on your intelligence\""]
["00:35,560","00:39,660","\"So the stupid kids were in 1A1 and the really smart kids were in 1A5\""]
["00:39,660","00:46,240","\"So the classes between 1A2, 1A3, 1A4 like 1A3 was the most average kids and that's where I was in and\""]
["00:46,240","00:53,500","\"Um, for some reason our very average class was the most worst behave in the whole school and we used like\""]
["00:53,500","00:57,560","\"I didn't personally but the kids in my school used to make our teachers cry daily\""]
["00:57,820","01:04,060","\"Like burst into tears and I was so fucking I remember that that happened when I was in middle school was that we were\""]
["01:04,060","01:06,540","\"there's only two grades that went to the school and\""]
["01:06,540","01:13,540","\"We were probably the tamas like our grade in specific. We're all the tamas people. We never fucked with anyone\""]
["01:13,540","01:15,540","\"Yeah, teachers or anything and\""]
["01:15,540","01:21,060","\"Well, we cut scenes. It's got seen as too autistic to continue\""]
["01:21,060","01:26,140","\"This is it\""]
["01:26,700","01:28,700","\"This plot is fucking stupid\""]
["01:28,700","01:32,720","\"That's so cool I\""]
["01:32,720","01:39,500","\"Really like the animation and sleeping beauty even though the movie's boring shit it is but the yes, it's a very beautiful movie\""]
["01:39,500","01:47,600","\"They knew what they was doing I like characters in it. Yeah, it's a it could have really been something\""]
["01:47,600","01:49,600","\"It was it was a really interesting\""]
["01:49,600","01:53,540","\"Stylistic change for Disney. I don't think a lot of people appreciate that\""]
["01:53,540","01:54,800","\"I like the music in it too.\""]
["01:54,800","01:57,700","\"Well no one ever appreciates when Disney does something different.\""]
["01:57,700","02:01,380","\"They just want the standard formula for Tony.\""]
["02:01,380","02:03,940","\"Holy shit, that was close.\""]
["02:03,940","02:09,340","\"But what I was saying was that we moved up into...\""]
["02:09,340","02:11,040","\"We moved up into...\""]
["02:11,040","02:13,340","\"I guess it was eighth grade we moved up into.\""]
["02:13,340","02:17,640","\"And the seventh graders came in and they were all fucking crazy.\""]
["02:17,640","02:21,540","\"The point I remember getting followed home by like three of them one day for no reason.\""]
["02:21,540","02:23,740","\"and they stood there on my line for like five minutes.\""]
["02:23,740","02:25,140","\"I have no idea why.\""]
["02:25,140","02:28,420","\"But what ended up happening was that we all got called\""]
["02:28,420","02:30,940","\"into the auditorium randomly at the end,\""]
["02:30,940","02:31,860","\"not the end of the year,\""]
["02:31,860","02:34,380","\"but it was like a few months before the end of the year.\""]
["02:34,380","02:36,740","\"The entire school got called in\""]
["02:36,740","02:38,900","\"and said us down and say, okay,\""]
["02:38,900","02:43,420","\"so someone smeared feces on all the lockers.\""]
["02:43,420","02:44,420","\"All the lockers.\""]
["02:44,420","02:47,700","\"And it was one of the seventh graders\""]
["02:47,700","02:50,460","\"fucking spread his ass open, stuck his hand in there\""]
["02:50,460","02:53,580","\"and smeared across all the lockers.\""]
["02:53,580","02:54,680","\"And he did it in the bathroom too,\""]
["02:54,680","02:56,380","\"and he wrote words on the wall within my face.\""]
["02:56,380","02:57,700","\"- But I got in my school to that too.\""]
["02:57,700","03:00,060","\"- And we all got called out for it,\""]
["03:00,060","03:00,900","\"and they were saying like,\""]
["03:00,900","03:02,720","\"okay, we're not going to let any of you leave\""]
["03:02,720","03:04,140","\"until someone speaks up about it.\""]
["03:04,140","03:05,700","\"And it's like, what the fuck is this?\""]
["03:05,700","03:06,540","\"- I think it's always a whole thing.\""]
["03:06,540","03:08,420","\"- You're gonna hold the entire school.\""]
["03:08,420","03:09,420","\"- Yeah, that's what they do.\""]
["03:09,420","03:10,380","\"- It seems like such an inefficient way\""]
["03:10,380","03:11,580","\"to deal with the problem.\""]
["03:11,580","03:13,020","\"- Well, what happened was the kid who did it\""]
["03:13,020","03:14,500","\"fucking pulled the fire alarm,\""]
["03:14,500","03:16,660","\"so everyone ended up leaving anyways.\""]
["03:16,660","03:20,220","\"But you can't hold an entire school\""]
["03:20,220","03:21,820","\"responsible for something like that.\""]
["03:21,820","03:22,820","\"That's just what they do.\""]
["03:22,820","03:24,220","\"And that was what happened.\""]
["03:24,220","03:29,020","\"And it was annoying because our class didn't ever do anything.\""]
["03:29,020","03:31,620","\"And then as soon as this younger class comes in,\""]
["03:31,620","03:32,520","\"it's constant.\""]
["03:32,520","03:35,420","\"This was happening all the time that they were just fuck around\""]
["03:35,420","03:38,120","\"and everyone would get pulled in together.\""]
["03:38,120","03:40,820","\"Because it happened like four or five times during the year.\""]
["03:40,820","03:43,820","\"It was this one kid in specific who kept doing this crazy shit too.\""]
["03:43,820","03:45,720","\"I think he eventually got expelled.\""]
["03:45,720","03:48,620","\"But it was really frustrating to have that happen all the time.\""]
["03:48,620","03:54,680","\"Class was the fucking worst for bullies - we had three kids in my class all called Steven and they were the first bully ever\""]
["03:54,680","04:00,760","\"They were the Stevens like the actual Stevens I fucking hated most of them one of them is really cool now\""]
["04:00,760","04:02,760","\"But the other two are still tense\""]
["04:02,760","04:05,800","\"They point to you saying you're dead\""]
["04:05,800","04:10,720","\"It was a guy in my school called Richard and he was a scariest motherfucker ever\""]
["04:10,720","04:16,480","\"He used to bully the shit out of me and one time I said called him crater face and he y'all I think he was gonna kill me\""]
["04:16,480","04:18,480","\"I\""]
["04:18,480","04:22,860","\"Heard he didn't I heard he grew up to be a very nice man though, but I haven't seen him since I\""]
["04:22,860","04:25,620","\"Don't think I ever had an experience like that at least\""]
["04:25,620","04:29,180","\"He was fucking scary. He was like the scariest guy ever\""]
["04:29,180","04:34,800","\"He was like super tall and like buff. I mean I had that swing Chris\""]
["04:34,800","04:38,160","\"I had that in high school and I remember someone was threatening to\""]
["04:38,160","04:40,320","\"Beat the shit out of me in the classroom\""]
["04:40,320","04:43,640","\"I just said okay go for it because there's a teacher standing right there. I said all right\""]
["04:44,800","04:50,040","\"Pull him up. He just ended up walking out, but he was really pissed about and whined about to everybody\""]
["04:50,040","04:52,680","\"I fucking had to keep worrying about it. I knew how like\""]
["04:52,680","04:59,160","\"Boys brains worked back when I was in school because if a guy like starts on you in school\""]
["04:59,160","05:03,900","\"And he's like what a fucking kill you just if you say anything but do it fucking try it\""]
["05:03,900","05:06,280","\"They're just gonna just keep doing that\""]
["05:06,280","05:12,200","\"But you don't think about that at the time you fucking actually say do it. They'll never do it again\""]
["05:12,200","05:16,200","\"I haven't talked to almost anyone I went to school with at this point.\""]
["05:16,200","05:22,200","\"The last one that I spoke to, I remember, was because I signed into my\""]
["05:22,200","05:29,200","\"my Xbox Live account in like 2000 11 or something and I was playing Halo with some friends.\""]
["05:29,200","05:32,200","\"And he sent me a message like, \"\"Hey, you want to play Halo?\"\"\""]
["05:32,200","05:37,200","\"And I invited him in. And I got to remember how much of an asshole he was during high school.\""]
["05:37,200","05:40,200","\"I kind of forgot because some years had gone by.\""]
["05:40,200","05:43,840","\"They acted completely the same to the point that he was just whining about the game and\""]
["05:43,840","05:48,720","\"I remember he had died in a match because we're all doing like a team game together.\""]
["05:48,720","05:50,720","\"I'm just not going to play anymore.\""]
["05:50,720","05:51,720","\"I died.\""]
["05:51,720","05:52,720","\"I'm not going to play anymore.\""]
["05:52,720","05:53,720","\"It's over.\""]
["05:53,720","05:54,720","\"We lost.\""]
["05:54,720","05:55,720","\"And everyone was just like, \"\"Shut up.\""]
["05:55,720","05:56,720","\"Keep playing.\"\"\""]
["05:56,720","05:59,080","\"And then he would throw it back in my direction.\""]
["05:59,080","06:03,240","\"I ended up just making a joke at his expense because that's what he would always do was\""]
["06:03,240","06:04,840","\"that he would shit on everybody else.\""]
["06:04,840","06:08,400","\"And I just made a joke at his expense and he freaked the fuck out and I said, \"\"What's\""]
["06:08,400","06:09,400","\"your problem?\""]
["06:09,400","06:12,900","\"Why are you always attacking me? What's your problem? Why are you doing this to me right now in front of everybody?\""]
["06:12,900","06:14,280","\"What is this?\""]
["06:14,280","06:16,680","\"And he left and everyone's just like\""]
["06:16,680","06:19,400","\"Do you ever want to just not play with him again?\""]
["06:19,400","06:23,440","\"I said yeah, and I never spoke to him again. Sounds cool\""]
["06:23,440","06:27,120","\"Guess what time it is. Kyrie fucking time?\""]
["06:27,120","06:32,660","\"You're me. You're Miku. He's got a little...\""]
["06:32,660","06:33,860","\"Years Miku?\""]
["06:33,860","06:35,860","\"It's Miku.\""]
["06:35,860","06:39,000","\"Years Miku.\""]
["06:39,000","06:41,000","\"Kyrie's a princess?\""]
["06:41,000","06:43,000","\"Yes.\""]
["06:43,000","06:48,000","\"I would have gotten that Domino's app if I have Riku instead of Miku.\""]

["06:51,000","06:53,000","\"He says it is I.\""]
["06:53,000","06:54,000","\"And so.\""]
["06:54,000","06:59,000","\"But first, you must give the princess back her heart.\""]
["06:59,000","07:02,000","\"I love this game dude.\""]
["07:02,000","07:06,000","\"I fucking love that this game was just made for dumbass little 12 year olds.\""]
["07:06,000","07:08,000","\"I just think this is the most epic shit.\""]
["07:08,000","07:10,280","\"This is the corniest cutscene in the game.\""]
["07:10,280","07:11,360","\"Give her back her heart!\""]
["07:11,360","07:13,820","\"But first, look at my light!\""]

["07:21,560","07:23,560","\"Yes, Kairi's inside me!\""]
["07:23,560","07:25,000","\"I made it!\""]
["07:25,000","07:27,440","\"You think anybody got off on that?\""]
["07:27,440","07:29,760","\"You think that turned on any kids?\""]
["07:29,760","07:30,260","\"Wait?\""]
["07:30,260","07:31,760","\"It is I.\""]
["07:31,760","07:33,440","\"And some.\""]
["07:37,600","07:38,600","\"There you go.\""]
["07:38,600","07:41,640","\"That's the tagline for the game.\""]
["07:41,640","07:49,880","\"Are you ready to see this cutscene three times, Julian?\""]
["07:49,880","07:50,880","\"Get out.\""]
["07:50,880","07:52,280","\"This is a serious moment.\""]
["07:52,280","07:53,280","\"No silly cartoon.\""]

["08:43,320","08:47,620","\"I probably I think I just grew out of it at that point, but if I was like seven or eight\""]
["08:47,620","08:50,060","\"I for sure would have been doing that separate\""]
["08:50,060","08:54,740","\"This is why it's good that we didn't have YouTube because I would have been doing that shit\""]
["08:54,740","08:58,520","\"I had a taiko video camera. I would record shit like that. Oh, I did too\""]
["08:58,520","09:00,960","\"I used to make Lord of the Rings priorities when I was super young\""]
