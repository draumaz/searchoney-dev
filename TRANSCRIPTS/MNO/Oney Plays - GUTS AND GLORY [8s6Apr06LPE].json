["19:12,140","19:14,140","\"Here's what happened. So I was talking to that guy.\""]
["19:14,140","19:16,140","\"And then as the conversation went on,\""]
["19:16,140","19:19,140","\"he started getting more weary and he started getting like kind of snobby.\""]
["19:19,140","19:22,140","\"And then there was a part where I jumped on the bottom of his car\""]
["19:22,140","19:26,140","\"and I discovered that there was an emote that let you spam guitars.\""]
["19:26,140","19:29,140","\"So if you touch the button, you would take out a guitar.\""]

["19:39,620","19:41,100","\"And he drove away.\""]
["19:41,100","19:42,900","\"And then I was just like, \"\"What? Okay.\"\"\""]
["19:42,900","19:45,940","\"And then I got in the military truck and I rammed him.\""]
["19:45,940","19:46,780","\"(laughs)\""]
["19:46,780","19:48,180","\"But that was good to him.\""]

["19:49,420","19:50,260","\"- No, but scary.\""]
["19:50,260","19:53,660","\"But then afterwards, I got banned.\""]

["19:55,420","19:56,380","\"I did way worse shit.\""]
["19:56,380","19:58,820","\"And then it turns out it was because of that guy,\""]
["19:58,820","20:02,100","\"he went on his stream and he pulled into the side,\""]
["20:02,100","20:06,480","\"for 20 minutes and he built up a huge report and the main reason he got me\""]
["20:06,480","20:10,740","\"banned was because I spawned guitar on his car and that was why I got banned\""]
["20:10,740","20:14,980","\"it's like it's not even a rule that you can't do that because the perception is\""]
["20:14,980","20:18,740","\"that you got banned because of that chase yeah no I'm also because I broke\""]
["20:18,740","20:26,940","\"roleplay but yeah but in my mind it was if you could spam a guitar why not oh\""]
["20:26,940","20:34,700","\"but that was the main reason I got banned was the guitars oh wow look at you go\""]
