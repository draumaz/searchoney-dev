["09:58,380","10:03,680","\"Yeah, we were talking about how it's it's kind of dumb that this game doesn't have the Estus\""]
["10:03,980","10:08,500","\"Yeah, and I think I do still stand by that I like the Estes system better that it's like okay\""]
["10:08,500","10:10,500","\"You have this amount of set things\""]
["10:10,500","10:18,380","\"Yeah ration it out, but there is a element of like you having to be in charge of your healing items that it does make souls kind of more important\""]
["10:18,380","10:22,180","\"Yeah, that's true because it's like yeah\""]
["10:22,180","10:24,740","\"They're still important in the other games because you use them to level up\""]
["10:24,740","10:28,460","\"But in this it's like you have to worry about that and potentially buying shit\""]
["10:28,460","10:32,340","\"Just like the blood vials and bloodborne so it is then another difficulty thing\""]
["10:32,340","10:37,280","\"But I don't know if I like it. I don't know the only problem is it like you can abuse it by as much as you want\""]
["10:37,280","10:38,380","\"Right\""]
["10:38,380","10:43,940","\"But also if you're not good at the game you get doubly fucked because you're not you don't have any cells to level up\""]
["10:43,940","10:45,300","\"Because you keep spending them on vials\""]
["10:45,300","10:50,780","\"Yeah, and then like if you can't buy vials you're just gonna keep dying over and over and not make any progress\""]
["10:50,780","10:57,720","\"Yeah, so yeah, I could think I still don't like it. Well, I don't know. That's just like here. It's just a very\""]

["16:30,480","16:33,280","\"and everything is AI, where it starts like freaking out\""]
