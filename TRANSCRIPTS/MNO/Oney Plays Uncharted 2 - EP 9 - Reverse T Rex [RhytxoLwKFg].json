["00:37,680","00:38,960","\"It's really a real...\""]
["00:38,960","00:43,120","\"A lot of games save on memory by using PNG sequences when they don't need 3d models.\""]

["01:13,120","01:20,040","\"I'm sure there's a really like good explanation, but they used to put games on cassette tapes, and I don't understand how that's even possible.\""]
["01:20,040","01:21,540","\"\"\"Maybe cassette. Wait, what are you doing? What's the case?\"\"\""]

["04:20,580","04:22,280","\"I was calling it bull cutters.\""]
["04:22,280","04:23,420","\"I was calling it the Super Bowl.\""]

["05:26,420","05:33,420","\"I would watch that show if it was like it's shearly consisted of exotic insects\""]
["05:33,420","05:39,580","\"You see the crawling on Kim Kardashian the fuck you feel she fights a little garden snake if you stood stepping on\""]
["05:39,580","05:44,220","\"She starts smushing it with her big high heels. She takes it. She sits breastfeed again\""]
["05:44,220","05:50,220","\"I've seen the episode where Kanye West walks in with a big mallet and starts smushing her toes\""]
["05:50,220","05:56,320","\"Have you seen the emphasis where he takes his screwdriver and screws a big screw?\""]
["05:56,320","05:59,100","\"That was a great one\""]

["06:26,020","06:29,900","\"He just put him in his closet. Oh, that's boring. I know\""]
["06:29,900","06:33,740","\"Should have made him into a new dinosaur. What if what if\""]
["06:34,140","06:38,380","\"His whole motive was he thought that the Smithsonian had assembled them wrong\""]
["06:38,380","06:44,140","\"And he was like the T-Rex really has tiny legs and really really big arms you guys will see\""]
["06:44,140","06:47,860","\"Once I get my hands on these bones all have the answers\""]
["06:47,860","06:51,260","\"Why did T-Rex's evolved to have such useless goddamn arms?\""]
["06:51,260","06:56,000","\"Why couldn't they have normal arms and normal legs and why couldn't they talk like us?\""]
["06:56,000","07:00,460","\"Yeah, how come T-Rex's were not up to date with the latest friends?\""]
