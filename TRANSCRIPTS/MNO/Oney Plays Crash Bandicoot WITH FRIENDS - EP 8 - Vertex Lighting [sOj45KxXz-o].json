["09:51,120","09:52,120","\"Fuck you.\""]
["09:52,120","09:57,040","\"It was a small focused effort. I like subtle music. I don't mind it\""]
["09:57,040","10:01,200","\"But I'm wondering to if it was also it's not catchy. You're not gonna listen to it in your car\""]
["10:01,200","10:04,080","\"But I am because of how how simple it is\""]
["10:04,080","10:08,440","\"I'm wondering if it was kind of like a quick thing they got in there too because I don't mind it\""]
["10:08,440","10:12,760","\"But I'm wondering I think it suits absolutely perfect\""]
["10:12,760","10:16,360","\"It's fucking rats\""]
["10:16,360","10:19,720","\"One sample\""]
