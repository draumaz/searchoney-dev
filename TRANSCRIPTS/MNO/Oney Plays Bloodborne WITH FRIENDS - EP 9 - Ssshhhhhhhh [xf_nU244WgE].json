["00:19,000","00:22,000","\"and like 20 feet away from the actual accident,\""]
["00:22,000","00:25,000","\"there's not a whole lot of blood, but you see the head,\""]

["00:40,760","00:44,520","\"Why would it be smiling? I think the second you smile when you\""]
["00:44,520","00:48,480","\"the second the very microsecond I knew that I'd seen death I would turn away\""]
["00:48,480","00:52,440","\"and walk until I didn't have to deal with it. Unless there was no one else\""]
