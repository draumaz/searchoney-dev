["00:05,580","00:07,880","\"Guy, what a stupid fucking enemy I'm fighting right now.\""]
["00:07,880","00:10,080","\"Yeah, it ever brought him back.\""]
["00:10,080","00:12,600","\"I brought him back for a crash bash.\""]
["00:12,600","00:14,520","\"Oh what?\""]
["00:14,520","00:16,140","\"By the way, he's- he's...\""]

["00:20,520","00:23,320","\"To be fair, he's not very good looking here though.\""]

["00:24,140","00:24,700","\"This music is-\""]
["00:24,700","00:27,080","\"Yeah, look at that fucking mug in the corner.\""]
["00:27,080","00:27,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:27,580","00:28,580","\"It's terrible.\""]
["00:28,580","00:29,720","\"Come on.\""]
["00:29,720","00:32,320","\"Music though doesn't seem very fitting for this fight.\""]
["00:32,320","00:33,320","\"Fuck you.\""]
["00:33,320","00:35,120","\"You got one shot at this, Chris.\""]
["00:35,120","00:37,120","\"He's gonna throw his big bowler.\""]
["00:37,120","00:42,080","\"Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are the demographic cohort following Generation\""]
["00:42,080","00:47,080","\"X. There are no precise dates for when this starts or ends, but researchers typically\""]
["00:47,080","00:53,400","\"use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid 1990s to early 2000s as ending\""]
["00:53,400","00:54,400","\"birth years.\""]
["00:54,400","00:55,800","\"You're a millennial, Chris.\""]
["00:55,800","00:57,080","\"Well, it doesn't make any sense.\""]
["00:57,080","00:58,360","\"Why is it called millennial then?\""]
["00:58,360","00:59,800","\"Because it's close to the millennium.\""]
["00:59,800","01:00,600","\"Yeah, I guess so.\""]
["01:00,600","01:05,240","\"We're just stupid, but yeah, you would assume it's people who were born in 2000.\""]
["01:05,240","01:07,000","\"Just seem to make more sense to me.\""]
["01:07,000","01:11,560","\"I know plenty of people though who are even like 30 though, and act really shitty.\""]
["01:11,560","01:12,360","\"That's true.\""]
["01:12,360","01:14,120","\"I'm telling you.\""]
["01:14,120","01:14,600","\"It's true.\""]
["01:14,600","01:16,520","\"It's American culture.\""]
["01:16,520","01:19,800","\"The fallacy is coming from the place where you're like, oh, all of them are\""]
["01:19,800","01:24,040","\"that way that because you're a millennial, you're really selfish and dumb.\""]
["01:24,040","01:27,320","\"One thing I like about Irish culture is that it's not really like that.\""]
["01:27,320","01:28,320","\"People...\""]
["01:28,320","01:30,320","\"It's just everybody punching each other on this tree.\""]
["01:30,320","01:33,360","\"People put up with fucking bullshit and they just get on with it.\""]
["01:33,360","01:36,760","\"That's certainly a thing to admire.\""]
["01:36,760","01:40,440","\"It's actually a problem because people put up with so much bullshit that they just let\""]
["01:40,440","01:43,080","\"fucking problems slip through and don't do anything about it.\""]
["01:43,080","01:44,080","\"That makes sense too.\""]
["01:44,080","01:47,480","\"Like we only started getting good internet finally recently.\""]
["01:47,480","01:48,480","\"It's okay.\""]
["01:48,480","01:52,320","\"We're trying to wave around a net neutrality and everything.\""]
["01:52,320","01:55,000","\"My mom and dad have 5 megabyte broadband right now.\""]
["01:55,000","01:57,040","\"Well, it's a good thing you're not there.\""]
["01:57,040","02:01,140","\"It's one of the main reasons I can't watch your channel. Oh, they can watch it\""]
["02:01,140","02:06,600","\"They just get like uploading videos from their house was a fucking uploading here is I fucking hate that\""]
["02:06,600","02:10,300","\"I hate that so much loading here is fucking heaven compared to there\""]
["02:10,300","02:12,880","\"I know but at the same time I\""]
["02:12,880","02:18,660","\"Came from Chicago and the internet there is actually phenomenal. Yeah as bad as that's not fiber, right?\""]
["02:18,660","02:24,160","\"They they're introducing Google fiber there. Yeah, but I didn't get to use it when I was there\""]
["02:24,160","02:31,320","\"But the point is like any most providers there were actually pretty good and even though people will give like Comcast a lot of shit\""]
["02:31,320","02:36,120","\"The nice thing about it was download rate that I had through them was like a hundred and forty\""]
["02:36,120","02:40,360","\"The internet in Philly was really good like really good\""]
["02:40,360","02:48,320","\"Megabit per second, but the upload rate. I think it was like 20 or something\""]
["02:48,320","02:53,960","\"It was it was decent. I come here. What are we fixed at - we're locked in at -\""]
["02:53,960","02:59,200","\"That's really bad. It's fucking terrible and even though we upgraded the most expensive package\""]
["02:59,200","03:05,140","\"They don't up your your upload rate with any of their packages. They're always just fixed in at two\""]
["03:05,140","03:10,520","\"So it you're a paranoid about like torrents and everything your upload speed is two megabytes mega bits\""]
["03:10,520","03:18,480","\"It's a specific rate and else it doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean anything you want to know how fast upload speed is in Ireland usually\""]
["03:18,480","03:22,320","\"Probably not even one point one. That's what I figured\""]
["03:22,600","03:25,920","\"It's lousy, but they're I think they're getting Google now, too\""]
["03:25,920","03:30,840","\"It was great in Chicago. It was fucking amazing. It was so easy to upload things\""]
["03:30,840","03:34,800","\"It was easy to play games and everything - I can't even fucking play games at this point\""]
["03:34,800","03:41,360","\"Like I can't play online games even though you think that too like oh, it's California the internet should be great here\""]
["03:41,360","03:46,640","\"No, it's terrible because guess what it's California. Everyone gets to be stuck with it. Yeah\""]
["03:46,640","03:49,960","\"That's how a lot of things happen to be out here\""]
["03:49,960","03:53,540","\"You know, it's really weird thing about internet is um, it's usually really good\""]
["03:53,540","04:02,620","\"The internet is usually very good word. Nobody's at like fucking rural fucking whatever like in Kansas\""]
["04:02,620","04:05,140","\"It's got an amazing internet. It's not getting yeah\""]
["04:05,140","04:13,420","\"Except like I don't know if it's rural than it's worse. What the fuck is that? Yeah, I don't know what the fuck\""]
["04:13,420","04:17,260","\"That would hurt a lot\""]
["04:17,260","04:19,860","\"No\""]
["04:19,860","04:27,640","\"No, not if it was me in the video case. I could easily kill it. I could kill Crash Bandicoot with a knife if I met him\""]
["04:27,640","04:30,420","\"So many people like that. I know\""]
["04:30,420","04:37,100","\"In gaming do you like seeing the black box around that? Yeah, cuz it didn't properly apply the alpha to it\""]
["04:37,100","04:43,460","\"I think it's a it's not that they didn't properly do it. It's just that that's a 3d thing where if you turn up the alpha\""]
["04:43,460","04:48,100","\"There's like levels of alpha. I know that's what I'm saying is I don't think they completely blacked it out there\""]
["04:48,100","04:51,800","\"So you can see the box around it. That's what happens in blender. I\""]
["04:51,800","04:57,140","\"Also know people hate how that looks, but I do like that the ps1 dithers\""]
["04:57,140","05:03,700","\"Shading on everything. Yeah, cuz when it's when it's being blurred on like a CRT that actually looks really nice occur\""]
["05:03,700","05:05,900","\"It looks like there's more colors than there really are\""]
["05:05,900","05:12,500","\"Where'd you get them all? Oh wow those that's uh by the way if you're ever doing a gradient effect and something like that\""]
["05:12,500","05:14,500","\"And it's at a high resolution\""]
["05:14,820","05:21,940","\"Be sure to uh be sure to have dithering enabled on something like that or diffusion or whatever because I sleep through a light\""]
["05:21,940","05:26,900","\"Death if you don't do that you can see all of the different shades very clearly because\""]
["05:26,900","05:34,140","\"I'm only gonna get about 255 of them. So you want to spread that out better. We'll spread you a better baby\""]
["05:34,140","05:42,340","\"Poor text power almost beat the last the cortex vortex\""]
["05:43,340","05:46,240","\"Cindy vortex oh shit\""]
["05:46,240","05:49,660","\"Whoa, I love crash band. It was so much. See I\""]
["05:49,660","05:53,340","\"Like when games do stuff like that. I wanted to show off\""]
["05:53,340","05:57,820","\"I'm scared of this thing. I remember King of Fighters 94 would do that\""]
["05:57,820","06:02,860","\"It was trying really hard to show off 2d visual effects that could do with the Neo Geo hardware\""]
["06:02,860","06:06,820","\"so this way the beginning of one of the\""]
["06:06,820","06:09,500","\"when you're about to fight it would show like a\""]
["06:10,700","06:17,740","\"Door is opening and faking a 3d effect by scaling the graphics. They they like doing a lot of things like that to show up\""]
["06:17,740","06:21,180","\"Better keep doing\""]
["06:21,180","06:26,620","\"He's fine\""]
["06:26,620","06:36,100","\"You dude, oh there's just yeah straight who's that guy some asshole\""]
["06:37,380","06:40,380","\"Julian do do the the doom guy sound he gets hurt\""]
["06:40,380","06:44,380","\"Doom oh you keep asking me to do that. I haven't played it enough\""]
["06:44,380","06:46,820","\"goes\""]
["06:46,820","06:52,580","\"Whenever you say doom guy I think the doom song I keep thinking you're talking about the character from night in the woods\""]
["06:52,580","06:54,960","\"Oh, oh bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad\""]
["06:54,960","06:58,100","\"Oh, oh he's blattered. Yes gross. Oh\""]
["06:58,100","07:03,060","\"Wow that fucking hurt a lot. Wow. That's acid. That would be whoa\""]
["07:04,100","07:10,900","\"Jesus Julie you need a cam down you fucking retard. I don't calm down damn damn fucking spastic. No, let's\""]
["07:10,900","07:18,140","\"Let's talk about night in the woods. No, I don't want I don't I really don't want to either. I'm sick of talking about it. What is it?\""]
["07:18,140","07:21,820","\"Shitty it's not shitty\""]
["07:21,820","07:29,060","\"Don't be don't don't exaggerate. It's just Julian Julian you it's not shitty\""]
["07:29,060","07:34,060","\"It's just Julian you were miserable not to mention the fact that the writing is all the writing is\""]
["07:34,060","07:35,100","\"- That's the worst part about it.\""]
["07:35,100","07:36,940","\"- That's all that game has.\""]
["07:36,940","07:38,300","\"- It looks nice and there's good music.\""]
["07:38,300","07:41,860","\"- Julian, Julian, the writing is the main focus though.\""]
["07:41,860","07:43,660","\"You're not doing anything but holding left\""]
["07:43,660","07:44,500","\"on the keyboard for the last time.\""]
["07:44,500","07:46,100","\"- Yeah, I think that's a bad thing.\""]
["07:46,100","07:48,540","\"- I know, but I'm saying the writing is the whole point\""]
["07:48,540","07:50,220","\"to the game, if the writing is bad\""]
["07:50,220","07:52,660","\"and a game that you don't do anything in,\""]
["07:52,660","07:55,060","\"I don't think the visuals can really carry it.\""]
["07:55,060","07:56,780","\"- Well, I mean.\""]
["07:56,780","07:58,780","\"- I love how it looks.\""]
["07:58,780","07:59,940","\"I'll say that.\""]
["07:59,940","08:01,900","\"- I love those fucking monitors.\""]
["08:01,900","08:03,260","\"- Whoa, yeah, look at that chin.\""]
["08:03,260","08:05,120","\"*mimics\""]
["08:05,120","08:06,720","\"Why is Frank in man?\""]
["08:06,720","08:09,820","\"Why is he standing in the blue room with a camera dangling around?\""]
["08:09,820","08:12,660","\"Why has he got two monitors to show it?\""]
["08:12,660","08:13,660","\"All I need is one?\""]
["08:13,660","08:15,660","\"Because he's trying to scare you.\""]
["08:15,660","08:23,860","\"If he can create flying robots, why doesn't he put guns on him to shoot guns?\""]
["08:23,860","08:27,760","\"Those little things, that's the projector in the second game.\""]
["08:27,760","08:29,760","\"I'm an erector. See?\""]
["08:31,860","08:33,860","\"Oh, you're right\""]
["08:33,860","08:35,860","\"It's cute\""]
["08:35,860","08:37,860","\"Okay, well\""]
["08:37,860","08:40,100","\"Even though\""]
["08:40,100","08:44,940","\"Even though you thought night in the woods was a really miserable experience. Okay, it wasn't awful. I\""]
["08:44,940","08:49,380","\"Think I wouldn't have been as miserable if we'd taken it in chunks\""]
["08:49,380","08:54,980","\"It's cuz we sat down. I don't know I don't know if I'd want to come back to it as a thing\""]
["08:54,980","08:59,060","\"I gotta do that. I hate almost every character in it and\""]
["08:59,460","09:04,040","\"On top of that with how the writing is if people say they can actually relate to it\""]
["09:04,040","09:09,960","\"Like they're gonna say this character is literally me. Yeah, I'd be that that I would raise my eyebrow go\""]
["09:09,960","09:11,960","\"Oh, you're like this\""]
["09:11,960","09:22,520","\"Because we're talking about that to the idea of like saying oh this character's me or like oh I could really relate with them\""]
["09:22,520","09:27,920","\"If a character has one thing that they've experienced that lines up with something you've experienced\""]
["09:27,920","09:30,920","\"That doesn't mean you necessarily relate with them overall.\""]
["09:30,920","09:36,920","\"I'm just starting to get sick of the idea of relatability in general because people really...\""]
["09:36,920","09:38,920","\"It's really forced to be able to...\""]
["09:38,920","09:40,920","\"Oh yes, it is forced. People will...\""]
["09:40,920","09:42,920","\"People will just want to relate to a picture.\""]
["09:42,920","09:44,920","\"It's like the stereotypes of what a teenager would do too.\""]
["09:44,920","09:48,920","\"Let's go rebel against my boss.\""]
["09:48,920","09:50,920","\"Let's go smash light bulbs with the baseball bat.\""]
["09:50,920","09:54,920","\"Fucking pigs eff the police.\""]
["09:54,920","09:55,920","\"What else?\""]
["09:55,920","09:59,960","\"They don't say fucking pigs because they won't say they won't say fuck no they say F\""]
["09:59,960","10:04,760","\"But they'll say shit all the time. That's okay. They say ugh and sigh\""]
["10:04,760","10:08,200","\"but uh\""]
