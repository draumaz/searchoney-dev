["12:51,040","12:53,040","\"Is that supposed to be Uka Uka?\""]
["12:53,040","12:54,040","\"I think it's supposed to be Uka\""]
["12:54,040","12:55,040","\"No, that is-\""]
["12:55,040","12:57,040","\"Oh does he pop out and give you tutorials now?\""]
["12:57,040","12:58,040","\"If your cortex?\""]
["12:58,040","13:00,040","\"I would assume\""]
["13:00,040","13:02,040","\"Wait, did he have like a-\""]
["13:02,040","13:04,040","\"Is that a Uka sound?\""]
["13:04,040","13:06,040","\"Oh, this is Oxide Station\""]
["13:06,040","13:08,040","\"Is this the last one?\""]
["13:08,040","13:10,640","\"Yeah, and then we have to fight oxide.\""]
["13:10,640","13:12,440","\"Oh, so we're like right at the end.\""]
["13:12,440","13:14,140","\"Yeah, but this is gonna be hard.\""]
["13:14,140","13:15,440","\"This used to be my favorite level.\""]
["13:15,440","13:17,040","\"Let's see how fucking hard it is.\""]
["13:17,040","13:23,440","\"Does nitrous oxide have any like game-breakingly cheap things he can do as the final boss?\""]
["13:23,440","13:27,540","\"He just really fast and he drops TNC and potions and all that good shit.\""]
["13:27,540","13:30,540","\"Dude, this game is like orb central now.\""]
["13:37,540","13:39,220","\"Some bumbles\""]
["13:39,220","13:42,060","\"That's cool. Oh, that was sick. Yeah\""]
["13:42,060","13:46,660","\"Fuck it died\""]
["13:46,660","13:52,860","\"I feel like this level would have like a rainbow road kind of like oh you could drop down to skip the whole thing sort of\""]
["13:52,860","13:57,060","\"Secret to it was my crazy ass Mario shortcuts like that\""]
["13:57,060","14:03,780","\"There was one specifically on rainbow road where you could jump off the side and basically like skip half the track\""]
["14:03,780","14:06,940","\"I got a good feeling come on cortex go\""]
["14:06,940","14:08,940","\"You fucking slow bastard.\""]
["14:08,940","14:10,940","\"He was held back.\""]
["14:10,940","14:12,940","\"Held back by doubt.\""]
["14:12,940","14:14,940","\"Now he doubts nothing.\""]
["14:14,940","14:18,940","\"Now he believes everything he reads, and he's much faster for it.\""]
["14:18,940","14:20,940","\"We're gonna do it.\""]
["14:20,940","14:22,940","\"We're gonna do it.\""]
["14:22,940","14:24,940","\"I love that effect.\""]

["14:28,940","14:32,940","\"What would you do if you were just in regular everyday life and you heard that?\""]
["14:32,940","14:34,940","\"and you heard that\""]
["14:34,940","14:37,940","\"Did you ever just be standing around your ears start ringing and you're like ahh\""]
["14:37,940","14:45,180","\"Yeah, I hate this quieting. Isn't that tinnitus? Is it? No, it's only tinnitus if it stays there\""]
["14:45,180","14:46,220","\"Oh, I see\""]
["14:46,220","14:48,440","\"Man, if if it stayed there, I would kill myself\""]
["14:48,440","14:50,480","\"I'd just loads of people who have that too\""]
["14:50,480","14:55,260","\"I think there are people who killed themselves because of their tinnitus. Yeah, that would try me insane\""]

["14:57,260","15:00,140","\"Yeah, yeah like clocks and stuff\""]
["15:01,340","15:06,580","\"You know talking to somebody about that the other day where like a lot of like kind of shitty pop music\""]
["15:06,580","15:09,380","\"Almost sounds like a fucking alarm clock\""]
["15:09,380","15:12,380","\"It's like it's like\""]
["15:12,380","15:15,020","\"Viscerily physically annoying to listen to\""]
["15:15,020","15:21,940","\"Like what any examples like you know the song blurred lines how does it go?\""]
["15:21,940","15:26,820","\"It literally sounds like a fucking like Casio keyboard loop. It's just literally like\""]

["15:32,820","15:41,620","\"It sounds like something you'd hear it like a old fashioned circus. It's the you want to hug me what rhymes with hug me. It's that one. Mmm.\""]
["15:41,620","15:55,820","\"The lyrics on it were pretty epic. I'm gonna talk about fuck me. Yeah, that doesn't rhyme with hug me. It kind of does and that's what your mind is meant to... Your mind went there Chris. It went there because it got to think of anything else. It's called \"\"Cossed\"\" rhyme.\""]
["15:55,820","16:01,200","\"It's genius. Okay, if you say so well sounds like you might know the band or something\""]
["16:01,200","16:09,320","\"No, I get like weird like hate obsessions with certain things that annoy the fuck out of me and that one is one of them\""]

["16:22,900","16:29,660","\"I know we got to do that. I'm you but better what if you showed up and he just went\""]
