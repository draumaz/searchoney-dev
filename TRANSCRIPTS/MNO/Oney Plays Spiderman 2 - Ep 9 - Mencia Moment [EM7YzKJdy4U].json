["07:10,780","07:13,980","\"Could be right you could be totally right?\""]
["07:13,980","07:16,660","\"They are scary men\""]
["07:16,780","07:24,640","\"They terrify me imagine if you signed the contract with them though and they were like it's it's time to call in a favor and you're fucking Robert\""]
["07:24,640","07:29,460","\"Downy Jeremy because it's one of the Farley brothers who the Farley brothers made\""]
["07:29,460","07:34,480","\"Look no, no, I thought so they made I was gonna say I was gonna say that they made double-dubbering stuff\""]
["07:34,480","07:41,020","\"So the Farley brothers made fucking double-dubber shallow hell me myself every oh, we're thinking of someone else then because\""]
["07:41,020","07:46,900","\"Something about Mary no one of the Peter Farley no he made okay stuff back\""]
["07:46,900","07:51,640","\"There's no way we're talking about Simga I'm talking about the two guys who are two of the six writers of scary movie\""]
["07:51,640","07:54,380","\"You're thinking about the guys who did epic movie. Yeah\""]
["07:54,380","08:02,460","\"Okay, so the fucking father brothers I think and the starving games and March of the farce of the penguins\""]
["08:02,460","08:08,100","\"I'm gonna look it up, but I'm pretty sure they made a march of the penguins. Why yeah farce of the penguins\""]
["08:08,100","08:10,100","\"So here's the story. This is why\""]
["08:10,300","08:14,880","\"Cuz the epic funny haha so this movie by the way, which is you're right\""]
["08:14,880","08:18,540","\"So the father brothers really double-dubber. We myself an already very much of like movies\""]
["08:18,540","08:22,520","\"I did okay that were pretty liked right yeah, like don't there was a good movie. I think it's funny\""]
["08:22,520","08:26,720","\"So like I loved it was the best one on that list that you fucking love\""]
["08:26,720","08:32,480","\"Red or not but right so those movies came out in like the one mid to late 90s. Yeah\""]
["08:32,480","08:37,460","\"And that movie movie 43 came right fucking after that\""]
["08:38,080","08:43,100","\"Originally it started in 2002 or 3 so basically that would be like signing up with\""]
["08:43,100","08:47,820","\"be like say with John Hughes right after like the breakfast like breakfast club or like\""]
["08:47,820","08:51,700","\"Place for his or obvious and then he makes a movie after like home\""]
["08:51,700","08:57,220","\"You know like the fucking Beethoven movies. Yeah. Yeah, and you have to be in it because you signed a fucking contract\""]
["08:57,220","09:01,120","\"As he was making those ago, but as he was making those great movies, which is exactly what happened there\""]
["09:01,120","09:07,900","\"So I was a log in pointless. I just think that it's one of the most like bafflingly like horrible things\""]
["09:07,900","09:10,480","\"that like business-wise is that?\""]
["09:10,480","09:12,940","\"- That movie is genuinely like one of the worst things\""]
["09:12,940","09:14,240","\"I've ever, movies I've ever seen.\""]
["09:14,240","09:16,680","\"- I wonder if any studios saw that\""]
["09:16,680","09:19,200","\"and started hedging their bets on like young actors\""]
["09:19,200","09:21,040","\"that they thought we're gonna go far,\""]
["09:21,040","09:23,120","\"had them like sign onto a movie early\""]
["09:23,120","09:25,360","\"so that they could make this really like huge\""]
["09:25,360","09:26,720","\"block box during 20 years.\""]
["09:26,720","09:28,520","\"- A couple of other, about those people were pretty like\""]
["09:28,520","09:30,880","\"whatever load when they signed up actually I think.\""]
["09:30,880","09:33,520","\"- Oh yeah, there's huge actors in that movie too.\""]
["09:33,520","09:36,920","\"- Yeah, that's why it's like fascinating.\""]
["09:36,920","09:44,560","\"Because all these actors that didn't want any part of it signed a contract 15 years ago when they didn't really have careers\""]
["09:44,560","09:46,380","\"They had to do it\""]
["09:46,380","09:52,340","\"Yeah, I think a little bunch of seeds of it watching it grow and say haha. Yeah, I wonder if any executives got ideas after that\""]
["09:52,340","09:57,560","\"Fucking uh, but yeah those guys who are the scary movie. You just gotta get the money\""]
["09:57,560","10:01,040","\"You don't gotta fuck that guy. I think this is such a pointless fucking thing\""]
["10:01,040","10:03,880","\"But I do think that the fourth one was made by them to the same people\""]
["10:04,120","10:10,120","\"It wasn't me by the Waynes brothers it was not you're sure absolutely sure I know the fifth one was just new people completely\""]
["10:10,120","10:14,340","\"No, it was it's the two guys. I'm telling you these two guys\""]
["10:14,340","10:17,160","\"Like I'm like a fucking schizophrenic\""]
["10:17,160","10:24,140","\"They freak me out because there's no way that they could have gotten\""]
["10:24,140","10:28,080","\"Must have done some\""]
["10:30,440","10:33,040","\"Chris is on his arm standing straight up right now.\""]
["10:33,040","10:33,880","\"- I fucking hate it.\""]
["10:33,880","10:35,240","\"- He's fucking, he's in shock right now.\""]
["10:35,240","10:37,480","\"- He's pointing at the wall and he's mouthing the words\""]
["10:37,480","10:39,120","\"right there, right there.\""]
["10:39,120","10:41,240","\"I remember when I went to see \"\"Scary Movie 4\"\",\""]

["10:43,160","10:44,000","\"- Scary.\""]
["10:44,000","10:45,840","\"- And then you were actually scared of the movie.\""]
["10:45,840","10:46,680","\"I was actually--\""]
["10:46,680","10:48,960","\"- Now currently you're scared of the theater.\""]
["10:48,960","10:50,640","\"- I was the prime demographic for that movie\""]
["10:50,640","10:52,120","\"when it came out and I fucking hated it.\""]
["10:52,120","10:54,000","\"- I literally yelped a laugh to I hullered.\""]
["10:54,000","10:56,480","\"Scary movie filled fridge, I didn't see.\""]
["10:56,480","10:57,520","\"You should, there's a little section\""]
["10:57,520","10:58,360","\"where it says directed by--\""]

["11:21,760","11:27,360","\"That's the thing that pisses me off most about those movies is they literally buy costumes from like\""]
