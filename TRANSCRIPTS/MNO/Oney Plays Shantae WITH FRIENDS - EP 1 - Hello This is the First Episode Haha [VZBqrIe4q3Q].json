["04:51,380","04:53,380","\"The year of the mount.\""]
["04:53,380","04:55,380","\"I think it's the same time frame.\""]
["04:55,380","04:59,380","\"Whenever Disneyland was discovered.\""]
["04:59,380","05:08,940","\"Do you think the genie was predicting the future or do you think it was modern times?\""]

["05:09,940","05:12,500","\"Um, do you think it's the future?\""]
["05:12,500","05:17,700","\"the genie new Elvis so I think you know honestly this 107 facts about Aladdin\""]
["05:17,700","05:21,900","\"could definitely be on Federator Chris most definitely I think that's where I\""]
["05:21,900","05:27,220","\"saw it if the genie knew about Elvis then what else did he know about hmm\""]
["05:27,220","05:33,100","\"why didn't he warn people about 9/11 Corey what are those fellas want they\""]

["05:43,560","05:46,600","\"It was just, Chris, it was just someone in their burka.\""]
["05:46,600","05:47,600","\"It was clamps.\""]
["05:47,600","05:49,000","\"Was the red burka, Chris.\""]

["05:55,360","05:57,120","\"Is that death coming out of the water?\""]
["05:57,120","05:59,480","\"Yeah, that indicates when there's gonna be a death pit,\""]
["05:59,480","06:01,800","\"which I think is actually a good idea in a game like this,\""]
["06:01,800","06:03,480","\"'cause you never really know.\""]
["06:03,480","06:05,640","\"It's cute, it suits the pirates.\""]
["06:06,960","06:07,800","\"- Oh my god.\""]
["06:07,800","06:10,040","\"- All right, I'm gonna fight the boss soon.\""]

["06:17,120","06:18,680","\"- I think I can dance.\""]

["06:25,000","06:27,080","\"for beating this guy without him, okay.\""]
["06:27,080","06:28,600","\"So I boy stared out in the preschool\""]
["06:28,600","06:30,040","\"and converted into a long-range cannon.\""]
["06:30,040","06:32,000","\"He basically wants to turn this town into like a ship,\""]
["06:32,000","06:32,840","\"essentially.\""]
["06:32,840","06:33,680","\"- Mm.\""]
