["06:05,040","06:10,460","\"This did it\""]
["06:10,460","06:13,900","\"Yeah, it's obviously stolen\""]
["06:13,900","06:17,100","\"Cory you're clean no clipping through the wall\""]

["06:26,900","06:28,900","\"This is the longest level.\""]
["06:28,900","06:32,900","\"That's the only thing in the game that works.\""]
["06:32,900","06:34,900","\"Oh, this guy hates this level.\""]
["06:34,900","06:36,900","\"Is it a maze?\""]
["06:36,900","06:38,900","\"This is the longest level.\""]
["06:38,900","06:40,900","\"That's a pretty fun level.\""]

["06:54,900","06:59,580","\"Oh great. This is the worst. Is it a maze? Pretty much.\""]
["06:59,580","07:04,500","\"That's my own. It's a bonus level. We know how you are a bonus level now.\""]
["07:04,500","07:12,400","\"Yeah. I'm joking. I don't have a good track. Oh I remember this. He like falls behind the mirror and he thinks he's in the mirror world.\""]

["07:16,600","07:20,400","\"It's like everything's upside down. What the fuck? They actually made it upside down to this.\""]
["07:20,400","07:26,400","\"That's not canon to the show at all. It makes sense gameplay wise though gives you a new thing to explore kind of it's a good idea\""]
["07:26,400","07:28,400","\"Yeah interesting to see\""]
["07:28,400","07:32,000","\"Imagine like he'd come across like spike through the balloons then\""]
["07:32,000","07:41,200","\"Browner clue\""]
["07:47,760","07:53,160","\"Look like a black widow except brown collect all the scattered balloons before the timer runs out there in a red tire balloon\""]
["07:53,160","07:56,520","\"I'll look that color. All right, so just gotta get the balloons. Just collect the balloons\""]
["07:56,520","08:00,000","\"It's easy the next time you see it could seem with D with D and Tommy\""]
["08:00,000","08:04,400","\"Like see it the Tommy's head is like twice as wide as a week like pelvis\""]
["08:04,400","08:07,560","\"No way\""]
["08:07,560","08:13,200","\"I was going up, but then I was like, you know what? Yeah, that's usually bigger than the Genes\""]
["08:15,280","08:18,540","\"You can't look at the pictures upside down now for extra comedy value\""]
["08:18,540","08:30,360","\"The balloons are you supposed to hit the first one go back? Oh my god\""]
["08:30,360","08:41,700","\"Where is the balloon, yeah, it's right all right\""]
["08:43,720","08:49,880","\"You gotta smack it open. How do you do that though? I'm pressing it. Oh, there you go. Get all the balloons\""]
["08:49,880","08:53,240","\"Oh shit, I'm being timed on fire. Yeah, yeah, you're gonna hurry\""]
["08:53,240","08:56,840","\"Those right there floating up to the turn escape from you. Yeah\""]
["08:56,840","09:02,940","\"You gotta go to other rooms wait. I know you gotta go to the room. That's spike shadow\""]
["09:02,940","09:06,760","\"No\""]
["09:09,200","09:13,500","\"No, it's bonus. Oh you scattered the blue alright. So yeah time this whole time\""]
["09:13,500","09:23,440","\"Find more colors after this\""]
["09:23,440","09:38,340","\"There's a box in that room you just love what a fun bonus game this level fucking\""]
["09:38,340","09:40,340","\"What the fuck?\""]
["09:40,340","09:42,340","\"Dude, this is scary.\""]
["09:42,340","09:44,340","\"This level bites.\""]
["09:44,340","09:46,340","\"This is really good.\""]
["09:46,340","09:48,340","\"There's no box in here, you liar.\""]
["09:48,340","09:50,340","\"I'm sorry, I thought they would put it in.\""]
["09:50,340","09:52,340","\"It would have made more sense if they had to put the box in there.\""]
["09:52,340","09:54,340","\"What did he want in the saw time he was running out of the ceiling?\""]
["09:54,340","09:56,340","\"Go back in the original room. It has to be in the earth.\""]
["09:56,340","09:58,340","\"What if did he want in the saw time he was running out of the ceiling?\""]
["09:58,340","10:00,340","\"In the original room?\""]
["10:00,340","10:02,340","\"What'd you do?\""]
["10:02,340","10:04,340","\"What'd you try to swan it, Tom?\""]
["10:04,340","10:06,340","\"No, I'm not trying to piss you off.\""]
["10:06,340","10:08,600","\"From a game design aspect, I-\""]
["10:08,600","10:11,100","\"They should have put that other box in that other room.\""]
["10:11,100","10:13,080","\"Yeah, they put it in the same room, they put the other box.\""]
["10:13,080","10:13,600","\"Yeah, that's great.\""]
["10:13,600","10:16,200","\"No, I'm not talking about the first one.\""]
["10:16,200","10:18,100","\"I'm talking about where the blue balloons ended.\""]
["10:18,100","10:19,260","\"They probably should have put the red box.\""]
["10:19,260","10:21,280","\"Yeah, where it ended, it ends in that room.\""]
["10:21,280","10:22,380","\"That would have made sense.\""]
["10:22,380","10:24,100","\"Until they just fucking scattered everywhere.\""]
["10:24,100","10:25,100","\"It's probably in the attic.\""]
