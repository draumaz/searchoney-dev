["00:28,500","00:31,300","\"This is kind of an artsy fartsy game.\""]
["00:31,300","00:32,300","\"- Now have you never seen this?\""]

["00:42,220","00:43,500","\"This one's actually--\""]
["00:43,500","00:44,740","\"- This is made by the same people.\""]
["00:44,740","00:46,420","\"- Oh, you're a little boy running in the woods too?\""]
["00:46,420","00:47,260","\"- Yeah.\""]
["00:47,260","00:48,100","\"- So--\""]
["00:48,100","00:48,940","\"- They're full of ideas.\""]

["00:50,740","00:52,620","\"- This is the game, Chris.\""]
["00:52,620","00:53,460","\"- So you just start,\""]
["00:53,460","00:55,020","\"it's kind of like a cold open a little bit.\""]
["00:55,020","00:57,020","\"- Yeah, it just throws you right the fuck into it.\""]
["00:57,020","00:58,340","\"- That's kind of cool.\""]
["00:58,340","01:00,340","\"Let's have a walk in the woods you boys\""]
["01:00,340","01:11,820","\"So you're kind of supposed to go in not knowing anything you just yeah, so so this game I think is really cool\""]
["01:11,820","01:18,640","\"Um because it's very like open to interpretation who but you think it's really cool because you're a little boy\""]
["01:18,640","01:20,640","\"No\""]
["01:20,640","01:26,340","\"I just want to relive my childhood being chased through the woods by faceless people\""]
["01:27,620","01:33,080","\"Now but this game's pretty neat. Oh just because it's a little bit like open to interpretation\""]
["01:33,080","01:37,100","\"But it gives you very clear like there are very clear events that happen in the game\""]
["01:37,100","01:38,280","\"so\""]
["01:38,280","01:42,340","\"There's a lot of different ways you can piece together the story, but there's definite things that\""]
["01:42,340","01:46,720","\"Definitely happen that you can choose to connect or not connect\""]
["01:46,720","01:50,140","\"Look now that is taking you away\""]
["01:50,140","01:53,220","\"That is kind of making me going\""]
["01:56,940","02:02,420","\"That is making me go. What is that truck? What is this street? What is this voice? Who am I?\""]
["02:02,420","02:04,740","\"Why is it so foggy outside?\""]
["02:04,740","02:09,260","\"Because it makes for a good shot. It's good. It's a mysterious also because it covers up\""]
["02:09,260","02:12,660","\"Speaking of good shots, you should run out in front of those guys see what happens\""]
["02:12,660","02:24,800","\"Are they chloroforming you? No, he's just making me sleep. He's chloroforming you throwing you in the back of the truck\""]

["03:43,620","03:45,900","\"I don't want to admit to knowing this\""]
["03:47,260","03:52,160","\"No, it's like a big like monster. It's a big monster person and there's a point in the game where you become a strong\""]
["03:52,160","03:58,700","\"Way we go\""]
["03:58,700","04:04,240","\"He didn't bring the box you idiot. I guess I should go back and get that. I think you need to\""]

["04:48,380","04:51,380","\"Little boy body physics.\""]
["04:51,380","04:52,780","\"Yeah, it's funny.\""]
["04:52,780","04:54,860","\"That's what it's called in the game code.\""]
["04:54,860","04:55,860","\"Little boy body physics.\""]
["04:55,860","04:57,220","\"Turned up to 100.\""]
["04:57,220","05:00,900","\"Little boy body physics value one.\""]
["05:00,900","05:03,900","\"One thing you gotta give this game is it looks really good for how simple it is.\""]
["05:03,900","05:05,500","\"It looks great, actually.\""]
["05:05,500","05:08,620","\"I actually like this.\""]
["05:08,620","05:10,500","\"I mean there's not much to it.\""]
["05:10,500","05:11,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:11,500","05:18,140","\"Consider this to be like one of the very few games that I've played where I would consider it like almost perfect\""]
["05:18,140","05:22,120","\"I think it's the fog that's like covering the details so your mind fills in the blanks\""]
["05:22,120","05:25,780","\"It's but it doesn't really well. Yeah with with what it aims to do\""]
["05:25,780","05:29,740","\"I think it pulls it off like perfectly. Yeah, it's not super ambitious\""]
["05:29,740","05:32,700","\"At least not gameplay wise or whatever\""]
["05:32,700","05:40,500","\"But as far as like atmosphere and sound and pacing I really really like this game. You're right Lyle holding right is really fun\""]
["05:40,500","05:48,900","\"Listen I'll give you a fucking right you bitch. I'll give you some human rights. Oh shit\""]
["05:48,900","05:51,380","\"Decar it come\""]

["06:03,340","06:10,000","\"Feel like that thing gets old quite fast what hide-in from fellers no other thing where it's like it's gonna get me\""]
["06:10,000","06:13,040","\"Ah, ah, ah, and it just it's always can get you though, can it?\""]
["06:13,040","06:19,840","\"There's a there's some puzzles later on in the game where you kind of have to play with with your life kind of where you have to\""]
["06:19,840","06:26,320","\"You I'll point it out when it happens. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about Chris. Oh boy. Why are these old fucking men after you?\""]
["06:26,320","06:30,720","\"Yo, oh, yeah, you can try you can trip over the shit. Oh\""]

["06:49,120","06:52,560","\"You fuck me should have used that before maybe yeah. Oh\""]
["06:52,560","06:55,600","\"Holy fuck dude\""]
["07:01,600","07:05,400","\"They really want this small child dead. I think I\""]
["07:05,400","07:11,040","\"Relatable thing it's true leave me alone. You have a bunch of moops\""]
["07:11,040","07:17,400","\"That was what happens to loud little children that stay out past their bedtime\""]
["07:17,400","07:23,600","\"That's what I'm saying this little kid kind of deserves what's coming on me. He's like he's swimming in shit water\""]
["07:23,600","07:26,000","\"Like to get away. Oh shit. When does he start drowning?\""]
["07:27,640","07:33,880","\"There's no gauge so you don't know they won't like he was choking so I was like not long\""]
["07:33,880","07:37,800","\"In the light he kind of looks like a Lego man his Lego man here\""]
["07:37,800","07:44,300","\"We know it there's no characters in this game have a face this game does that thing where they\""]
["07:44,300","07:46,560","\"mix a lot of\""]
["07:46,560","07:49,140","\"Physics with the animations themselves. That looks really good\""]
["07:49,140","07:55,020","\"Yeah, like the stumbling over when you jump and stuff. This game is tasteful with it. Yeah, it feels fine\""]
["07:55,020","07:57,020","\"It's like perfectly atmospheric\""]
["07:57,020","07:59,020","\"*screams*\""]
["07:59,020","08:00,020","\"*laughs*\""]
["08:00,020","08:04,320","\"Oh boy, sure smells awful down here.\""]
["08:04,320","08:08,020","\"It's because probably the dead pig corpse is that we're fucking late around everywhere.\""]
["08:08,020","08:11,820","\"Now what would you do if you were walking through an Irish field and you just happened upon the scene right here?\""]
["08:11,820","08:20,020","\"Dude, in Ireland when you're in, when you're like, when you're like eight, they show you videos of kids getting fucking drowning in quicksand.\""]

["08:21,520","08:23,520","\"No, no, what the fuck are you talking about?\""]
["08:23,520","08:28,580","\"In school they made a sit around the TV and they put on like a compilation of kids getting drowning in quicksand\""]
["08:28,580","08:33,340","\"Called epic drowning in quicksand montage\""]
["08:33,340","08:35,820","\"No, it was like a kid sitting on a fucking shed roof\""]
["08:35,820","08:38,440","\"And then they were slipping off and like literally I have nightmares to this\""]
["08:38,440","08:40,820","\"They were I'm gonna re- where's their quicksand in Ireland?\""]
["08:40,820","08:45,680","\"They just keep warning you about quicksand in Ireland. Yeah, they keep warning us about it. What? I know\""]
["08:45,680","08:48,040","\"What the fuck is that?\""]
["08:48,040","08:50,040","\"These little little chicks. Aww\""]

["09:19,200","09:21,240","\"We're like, \"\"Look at all the little baby ducks.\"\"\""]
["09:21,240","09:24,400","\"And then we noticed that they were all starting\""]
["09:24,400","09:25,320","\"to run onto the road.\""]

["09:30,400","09:31,560","\"and I'll go this way.\"\"\""]
["09:31,560","09:33,680","\"And we're just like trying to gather these little baby ducks.\""]
["09:33,680","09:35,960","\"And I got my side and I put them all back\""]
["09:35,960","09:37,920","\"onto the safety of the sidewalk.\""]
