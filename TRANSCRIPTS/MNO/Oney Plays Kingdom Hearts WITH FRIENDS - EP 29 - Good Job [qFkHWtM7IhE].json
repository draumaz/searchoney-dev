["06:57,540","07:00,100","\"I think part of I think part of the problem is that the\""]
["07:00,580","07:08,520","\"That became their template for all Disney movies after that. Well, they they experimented a little bit after and then everyone got mad\""]
["07:08,520","07:11,340","\"That's true when they did they did hunchback and everybody hated it\""]
