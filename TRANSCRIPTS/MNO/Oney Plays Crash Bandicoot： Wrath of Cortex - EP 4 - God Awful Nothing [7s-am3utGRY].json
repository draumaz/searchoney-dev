["03:42,140","03:43,980","\"This sounds like a song from Rascal.\""]
["03:43,980","03:47,380","\"- The song is fucking people screaming in it.\""]

["04:00,740","04:01,580","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:01,580","04:03,180","\"- That's the artwork of him from too long.\""]
["04:03,180","04:05,500","\"The lights look good to be actual.\""]
["04:05,500","04:07,440","\"- The, yeah, the little, how do they do that?\""]
["04:07,440","04:08,280","\"I don't know.\""]
["04:08,280","04:09,120","\"- You can see it like.\""]
["04:09,120","04:09,960","\"- I didn't know that was a thing you could do back then.\""]

["04:10,800","04:12,260","\"- Oh, I see it's a, yeah, they're just.\""]
["04:12,260","04:13,100","\"- Some constant planes.\""]
["04:13,100","04:15,140","\"- They're projecting the image a whole bunch of times.\""]
["04:15,140","04:17,220","\"- But how come that's not like making it get really slow?\""]
["04:17,220","04:19,140","\"- Because we're playing it on PS3.\""]
["04:19,140","04:21,340","\"It might have been slow on the actual PS2, I don't know.\""]
["04:21,340","04:22,180","\"- Nah.\""]
["04:22,180","04:26,460","\"- I feel like it would be slower on the PS3\""]
["04:26,460","04:28,460","\"because the PS3 is so annihilating.\""]
["04:28,460","04:30,220","\"- Sometimes things can emulate better.\""]
["04:30,220","04:32,180","\"I'm not sure though.\""]
["04:32,180","04:35,380","\"Maybe it just ran well. I don't know. I don't know.\""]
["04:35,380","04:39,480","\"They probably didn't have that effect on the GameCube version.\""]
["04:39,480","04:40,680","\"Probably not.\""]
["04:40,680","04:41,180","\"Oh.\""]
["04:41,180","04:42,080","\"Oops.\""]
["04:42,080","04:43,680","\"I don't know why I did that.\""]
["04:43,680","04:47,880","\"That's because I got distracted by the same fucking music.\""]
["04:47,880","04:51,380","\"I think the colors are pretty good in this level.\""]
["04:51,380","04:55,280","\"I like purple and magenta.\""]
["04:55,280","04:58,180","\"You're just trying to save yourself now, Mr. Negativity.\""]
["04:58,180","04:59,480","\"I mean, save myself.\""]
["04:59,580","05:02,780","\"I still think the characters look like God awful nothing\""]
["05:02,780","05:04,480","\"God awful nothing\""]
["05:04,480","05:05,380","\"God awful nothing\""]
["05:05,380","05:06,880","\"They should call this game God awful nothing\""]
["05:06,880","05:08,280","\"Should I call this game \"\"Kresh\"\"\""]
["05:08,280","05:09,680","\"I don't know that's what I'm getting for\""]
["05:09,680","05:10,680","\"I'm gonna name my son\""]
["05:10,680","05:12,280","\"God FUCK YOU I JUMPED\""]

["05:24,080","05:25,880","\"Yeah\""]
["05:25,880","05:26,680","\"It's epic\""]
["05:26,680","05:29,380","\"Just get on the platform\""]
["05:29,380","05:33,720","\"How can I tell if this thing is still recording? How can I tell if I'm really in love? Oh\""]
["05:33,720","05:43,320","\"I'm so happy that somebody finally uploaded it. It was very funny, and it was really uncomfortable with it was\""]
["05:43,320","05:46,260","\"What what do you say about fake?\""]
["05:46,260","05:52,500","\"Relationships that if you ever get into a disagreement. It's not a true relationship. Yeah, something like that\""]
["05:52,500","05:57,340","\"What are you just talking about? There's there's no so a long time ago. Oh, okay red letter media covered\""]
["05:58,360","06:03,320","\"An old VHS tape that was aimed at teens and I was supposed to give them relationships\""]
["06:03,320","06:07,240","\"You can use the bouncy bird. It's supposed to give them relationship advice go back. What?\""]
["06:07,240","06:10,440","\"Oh, yeah, sorry\""]
["06:10,440","06:15,400","\"I'm supposed to give this supposed to give teens relationship advice\""]
["06:15,400","06:22,120","\"But it was really shitty advice and we always wanted to watch the video because obviously they can't they can't upload the whole look at that capture\""]
["06:25,760","06:28,500","\"Travelers tails didn't test a game. It's even\""]
["06:28,500","06:30,900","\"We\""]
["06:30,900","06:33,600","\"Let's see you make a better crash game. Why did they make it so big?\""]
["06:33,600","06:36,960","\"What if you fell off\""]
["06:36,960","06:39,440","\"Hear that rat\""]
["06:39,440","06:46,760","\"No something gonna start chasing me. Yep. There we go. There it is the rat. Oh my god. Oh my goodness. He's really fast\""]
["06:46,760","06:49,880","\"What's that sound it's a rat?\""]
["06:49,880","06:53,320","\"No, the fucking screaming magic sound. Oh, yeah, what?\""]
["06:54,080","06:56,480","\"That's a computer malfunctioning ah I\""]
["06:56,480","07:01,900","\"You can't possibly reach you right. Oh break it turn around. Oh well\""]
["07:01,900","07:07,960","\"There's\""]
["07:07,960","07:14,800","\"Oh, I think in this game the things killing the boxes for you count as you killing the box that'd be nice\""]
["07:14,800","07:20,600","\"I'm pretty sure it's like the scene from Shrek where they break out of the castle and the dragon Chris there\""]
["07:20,600","07:26,360","\"Do you still like Shrek? I like the first two. I don't remember it well enough to say it was okay\""]
["07:26,360","07:31,000","\"Three was god awful. Why can I jump on the tables right there? Oh?\""]
["07:31,000","07:35,360","\"Well\""]
["07:35,360","07:40,720","\"That's not the original or the what's the point of being I thought the theme of the third game was time travel\""]
["07:40,720","07:42,720","\"And that's why it was medieval\""]
["07:42,720","07:45,080","\"Yeah, what is this one?\""]
["07:45,080","07:47,080","\"What is the theme of this one a mess?\""]
["07:47,080","07:49,040","\"Yeah\""]
["07:49,040","07:55,440","\"Pretty there is no theme. I mean the second game had different levels, but they're all in the same time period. Yeah\""]
["07:55,440","07:59,680","\"Like I didn't even recognize we talked about this before though\""]
["07:59,680","08:05,520","\"Three is kind of weird as a time travel game because there's only a couple levels that feel like it's time travel\""]
["08:05,520","08:07,520","\"Yeah, most of them just feel like it's regular time\""]
["08:07,520","08:10,880","\"Can barely tell what what's an enemy in this fucking level? Oh?\""]
["08:10,880","08:14,680","\"We're the bats enemies. I thought there were just background elements. Oh my god\""]
["08:14,680","08:17,420","\"I can see I can barely even see those guys. Well, they're dead now\""]
["08:17,420","08:20,260","\"Oh, yeah, what see okay?\""]
["08:20,260","08:27,260","\"We I thought you missed it's fun because I'm doing so good. I thought you missed crates\""]
["08:27,260","08:32,600","\"No, no the dragon got them for me didn't you only got 20 out of 22 on the bonus stage? No, I got them all\""]
["08:32,600","08:37,180","\"I'm doing good. I guess it must be and it's time travels stuff, right?\""]
["08:37,180","08:41,780","\"Cuz he's going just falling through the I mean it's using crash 3's theme song\""]
["08:41,780","08:44,300","\"Mm-hmm\""]
["08:45,020","08:55,740","\"entropy was in the in the room it's true he's gonna shit boy I'm gonna shit stupid boy\""]

["09:14,980","09:17,580","\"She was my path. Yeah, I don't know what oh\""]
["09:17,580","09:25,980","\"Man, this is scary. Why don't I remember this I played this game because it's boring. It's forget. We didn't get too far\""]
["09:25,980","09:29,100","\"No, I I got to near the end. I didn't beat it\""]
["09:29,100","09:34,180","\"But I because I remember I rented it and I played one I feel like I was in the final world\""]
["09:34,180","09:38,220","\"And then I lost all my lives and I couldn't I didn't have a save file because I\""]
["09:40,540","09:42,940","\"I feel like that's why a lot of people have such fun.\""]
["09:42,940","09:43,940","\"- Whoa!\""]
["09:43,940","09:44,780","\"- Okay.\""]
["09:44,780","09:45,940","\"- Oh, you're in science now.\""]
["09:45,940","09:46,780","\"- Okay.\""]
["09:46,780","09:48,000","\"- I think a lot of people didn't grow up\""]
["09:48,000","09:49,380","\"with the actual PS1 game,\""]
["09:49,380","09:51,420","\"so this was their first Crash game,\""]
