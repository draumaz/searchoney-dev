["03:38,940","03:45,980","\"Kortik specifically said I'm going into retirement. Oh, so they're their friends now. Yeah, they all have little weird orgies in their room\""]
["03:45,980","03:51,620","\"Huh? They go to Comic Con and have a weird furry orgies. I'm just here to watch\""]
["03:51,620","03:55,500","\"My turn, Bandy Goot\""]

["04:11,240","04:15,680","\"He wants to have a war perhaps a sort of racing war\""]
["04:15,680","04:20,860","\"It's true you can't deny it\""]
["04:20,860","04:24,080","\"Wait, so he's the best racer. Yeah, he's like\""]
["04:24,080","04:30,520","\"So he's like the king of the planet and he's the best racer. He's not the king of the planet. He comes from outer space\""]
["04:30,520","04:35,460","\"He's an alien. He specifically said that if he he's challenging us to a race and if we lose\""]
["04:35,460","04:39,600","\"I'll turn the whole planet into a giant parking lot right but in his own planet to see the king\""]
["04:39,600","04:42,680","\"No, he's just some idiot. Oh look at him\""]
["04:42,680","04:45,860","\"He's a dweeb. That's why he has to go to other planets\""]
["04:45,860","04:50,260","\"You know what this is spoiling all of the things I want to wait for let's let's just get in here\""]
["04:50,260","04:55,140","\"Is there an overworld in this yeah, it's like a little hub area. Oh, so like a diddy conge racing\""]

["05:04,120","05:07,880","\"Holy shit dude look how fast you can freaking go\""]
["05:07,880","05:14,180","\"All right, I wouldn't ask this question unless it specifically didn't have a plot to the game\""]
["05:14,180","05:19,240","\"Why does crash have an island with his face and his sister's face and all these people carved into it?\""]
["05:19,240","05:28,440","\"Asking this because there is a story in this game if the game was just like whatever it's it's cards and that's it\""]
["05:28,440","05:32,480","\"No, that's the thing in every kart racing game people always have their own track because it's like oh\""]
["05:32,480","05:37,860","\"Oh, I get my own track and then they get to spend like four million dollars renovating a place to look like themselves\""]
["05:37,860","05:40,560","\"Is that really that's actually the context? No\""]
["05:40,560","05:47,280","\"It's a stupid. Oh wow. I don't want it to spoil the looks of this is so fucking cool looking\""]
["05:47,280","05:53,260","\"Holy moly. Oh, I missed it. Do it. This is amazing. Look at that graphics\""]
["05:53,260","05:56,440","\"This actually does look really really good. I assume\""]
["05:56,920","06:00,280","\"None of this is actually assets from the original game, right?\""]
["06:00,280","06:05,120","\"Like it's not even built on the bones of it like they have to start something like this completely over, right?\""]
["06:05,120","06:11,040","\"Yeah, I think yeah pretty much this fucking feels amazing. It feels just like the original. Oh shit\""]
["06:11,040","06:16,620","\"That's the whole thing so you need to get I missed it you need to get apples to go faster\""]
["06:16,620","06:22,780","\"Sort of like mushrooms. Yeah, exactly. I mean it ripped off Mario Kart for sure, but I think it's more fun\""]
["06:22,780","06:25,560","\"It's a good it's a good thing to rip off. Oh shit\""]
["06:25,560","06:30,560","\"And it's not like there aren't a million other battle racing games besides Mario Kart\""]
["06:30,560","06:33,560","\"So when is the last time you played the original Chris?\""]
["06:33,560","06:35,560","\"Oh like three years ago.\""]
["06:35,560","06:37,560","\"Okay so fairly recent.\""]
["06:37,560","06:38,560","\"Fuckin asshole!\""]
["06:38,560","06:41,560","\"In other words you still remember how it plays.\""]
["06:41,560","06:47,560","\"Oh yeah this isn't like a hazy fever dream memory and you're like oh my brain is filling in exactly what this is.\""]
["06:47,560","06:48,560","\"Oh legitimately.\""]
["06:48,560","06:50,560","\"Yeah no like this feels really spot on.\""]
["06:50,560","06:54,560","\"Okay I'm sure I'm gonna run into something later that I hate but that's great.\""]
["06:54,560","07:03,280","\"That's great the rendering I think is for like crashes fur even and like oh oh just all the little lighting details look really solid\""]
["07:03,280","07:10,240","\"Look at that. So what was what was the thing that you said about the insane trilogy the lighting or something even even like?\""]
["07:10,240","07:16,720","\"Oh at first. Yeah, there's there's a certain parts that look really creepy like his eyes are for some reason blue and everything else is lit up\""]
["07:16,720","07:20,160","\"Hmm. It's just nothing that that's tremendous. Oh\""]
["07:21,200","07:28,060","\"This game looks pretty bright though. Yeah, no honestly. This is fucking beautiful. Okay. We're also playing on the PlayStation Pro\""]
["07:28,060","07:34,640","\"Because we're pro gamers actually so the version we're seeing at least is in 4k. Yeah\""]
["07:34,640","07:38,800","\"Solid\""]
["07:38,800","07:43,640","\"I did it you sure did you're the best racist\""]
["07:45,720","07:51,760","\"Look at that. That looks so great. His fate his facial animations are great. You got super saying that she both\""]
["07:51,760","07:55,220","\"Yeah, what did I say you said the S word? Oh?\""]
["07:55,220","08:02,480","\"You said the S slur super is a damn it. I keep saying it. It's called a POS a person of super\""]
["08:02,480","08:08,680","\"Try to wait until the turbo go okay never mind look look\""]
["08:08,680","08:12,600","\"You've got a trophy to put in your giant crash heads mouth\""]
["08:12,600","08:17,560","\"Oh, well, I guess everyone has their skins unlocked from the beginning because he's not supposed to be a panda\""]
["08:17,560","08:20,160","\"He's not no, he's a little polar bear\""]
["08:20,160","08:25,520","\"How do you know it's the same guy? It just definitely is there's no panda carrots are probably\""]
["08:25,520","08:31,480","\"Join Antifa by following me\""]
["08:31,480","08:37,200","\"There were masks I am a mask I will conceal your face\""]
["08:37,200","08:40,720","\"Cocktail\""]
["08:40,720","08:41,560","\"- 7-11.\""]
["08:41,560","08:43,720","\"- That is the exact thing that would happen.\""]
["08:43,720","08:46,200","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:46,200","08:48,000","\"- Oh man, where's the crash code?\""]
["08:48,000","08:48,980","\"I think this is it.\""]
["08:48,980","08:49,820","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:49,820","08:50,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:50,660","08:52,060","\"- I'm so happy.\""]
["08:52,060","08:53,320","\"I never get to have fun.\""]
["08:53,320","08:55,840","\"I never get to enjoy games.\""]
["08:55,840","08:57,680","\"- And after this, it's all over.\""]
["08:57,680","08:58,800","\"- Big air.\""]
["08:58,800","09:00,320","\"- It's true, savor and Chris.\""]
["09:00,320","09:02,520","\"- I beat this game 100% back in the day.\""]
["09:02,520","09:04,200","\"- Well, you better do it again.\""]
["09:04,200","09:05,240","\"- I'm not gonna do it again.\""]
["09:05,240","09:06,880","\"I don't have the time.\""]
["09:06,880","09:10,280","\"But we will experience everything good it has to offer.\""]
["09:10,280","09:12,760","\"All of our hairs are all standing up.\""]
["09:12,760","09:14,320","\"You know there's a lot of games.\""]
["09:14,320","09:17,080","\"I would especially Tomar's beard is actually going\""]
["09:17,080","09:19,360","\"completely the opposite direction.\""]
["09:19,360","09:20,760","\"Into my face.\""]
["09:20,760","09:24,880","\"I would say oh three, ooh, see you get a little turbo.\""]
["09:24,880","09:27,880","\"Yeah, get out of the way.\""]
["09:27,880","09:31,160","\"Fuck it, bomb him bastard.\""]
["09:31,160","09:35,080","\"So missile.\""]
["09:35,080","09:37,240","\"Well, okay, so you've never played Mario Kart.\""]
["09:37,240","09:39,480","\"In Mario Kart the further back you are,\""]
["09:39,480","09:41,400","\"They got rid of a fucking shortcut.\""]
["09:41,400","09:43,560","\"Oh, well, it's all over.\""]
["09:43,560","09:46,400","\"It's all over from here now, Chris is in a bad mood.\""]
["09:46,400","09:48,640","\"That misses me off.\""]
["09:48,640","09:49,800","\"Well, maybe it's there.\""]
["09:49,800","09:50,360","\"We'll see.\""]
["09:50,360","09:52,760","\"Yo!\""]
["09:52,760","09:54,760","\"So in Mario Kart, the further back you are,\""]
["09:54,760","09:55,880","\"the better items you get.\""]
["09:55,880","09:57,240","\"Is that the same in this game?\""]
["09:57,240","09:59,120","\"All right.\""]
["09:59,120","10:02,520","\"That sort of loser take all mentality\""]
["10:02,520","10:06,640","\"that racing games like to foster.\""]
["10:06,640","10:08,040","\"That's life, baby.\""]
["10:08,040","10:12,040","\"Oh, I got a shield. Is there a blue shell equivalent in this game?\""]
["10:12,040","10:13,840","\"Um, yeah, there's the orb.\""]
["10:13,840","10:15,340","\"The orb.\""]
["10:15,340","10:15,840","\"God!\""]
["10:15,840","10:16,840","\"Oh no!\""]
["10:16,840","10:19,740","\"I'm trying to that. I'm trying to that shortcut. That definitely is not the same.\""]
["10:19,740","10:21,740","\"My old nemesis, the great orb.\""]
["10:21,740","10:23,840","\"Um, Noah.\""]
["10:23,840","10:30,740","\"So basically there's an item that the person in eighth place can get that just fucks up the person in first.\""]
["10:30,740","10:31,740","\"Yeah, pretty much.\""]
["10:31,740","10:33,040","\"Yeah, I don't...\""]
["10:33,040","10:34,040","\"Why do they do that?\""]
["10:34,040","10:36,340","\"I don't know. It's probably the worst thing about these games.\""]
["10:36,540","10:41,540","\"It's because they think of them as party games, I think, when they're being designed.\""]
["10:41,540","10:46,340","\"So it's just like, \"\"Yeah, wouldn't it be funny if things could just really dramatically turn around?\"\"\""]
["10:46,340","10:47,340","\"I guess that makes sense.\""]
["10:47,340","10:52,540","\"And then if you see somebody has it, you could always like, stop and like, back up a little bit and let someone pass you.\""]
["10:52,540","10:53,840","\"So they get fucked over.\""]
["10:53,840","10:54,340","\"[Grunts]\""]
["10:54,340","10:55,340","\"Maybe you can do it.\""]
["10:55,340","10:56,740","\"Just wait harder.\""]
["10:56,740","10:58,140","\"Yeah, maybe that's nice of me stuff.\""]
["10:58,140","11:00,140","\"Probably just lost the muscle memory for it in your old age.\""]
["11:00,140","11:02,340","\"No, I definitely have not lost the muscle memory.\""]
["11:02,340","11:05,540","\"You're disgusting crinkle you slow fingers of...\""]
["11:05,540","11:09,880","\"No, I swear I know what I'm talking about okay. It does feel different. Oh\""]
["11:09,880","11:12,460","\"There's object motherfucker\""]
["11:12,460","11:15,560","\"You know what you know that story object motherfucker\""]
["11:15,560","11:19,300","\"Yeah, one of the bad guys in the game code is called object. Motherfucker\""]
["11:19,300","11:23,520","\"So it just forgot to like rename it\""]
["11:23,520","11:27,280","\"Well, they probably didn't think kids would open it up and dig through the yeah\""]
["11:27,280","11:30,020","\"I would think that back then they didn't do that kind of shit\""]
