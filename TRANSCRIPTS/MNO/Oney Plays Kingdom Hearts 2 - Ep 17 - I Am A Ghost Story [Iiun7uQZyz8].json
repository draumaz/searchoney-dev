["01:24,480","01:27,480","\"Wouldn't you say the human death is a disruption complete?\""]
["01:27,480","01:27,980","\"What?\""]
["01:27,980","01:29,080","\"Heheheheheheheh.\""]

["02:01,580","02:02,580","\"Okay.\""]
["02:02,580","02:04,580","\"Now we get to do the even worse one.\""]
["02:04,580","02:07,580","\"I would rather do the\""]

["02:09,580","02:10,580","\"Really?\""]
["02:10,580","02:12,580","\"Then the pirate world is so boring.\""]
["02:12,580","02:16,580","\"Oh my gosh, I just want to see Johnny Depp in a video game realm.\""]
["02:16,580","02:19,580","\"Well, you'll see him soon and I will see him soon.\""]
["02:19,580","02:25,580","\"I'm sorry I've been complaining about these worlds being boring.\""]
["02:25,580","02:28,580","\"I mean, there's not really a couple that I like in this game.\""]
["02:28,580","02:31,580","\"Kingdom Hearts 1 had better pacing, I think.\""]
["02:31,580","02:34,580","\"I think Kingdom Hearts is about 40 hours long.\""]
["02:34,580","02:38,580","\"Yeah, and the worlds were, you could beat a world in like an hour usually.\""]
["02:41,580","02:44,540","\"Look at this this is big crab\""]
["02:44,540","02:47,940","\"Why would they put who put that there?\""]
["02:47,940","02:51,340","\"Me are these heartless. That's a crabs heartless\""]

["02:53,940","02:59,100","\"No, I was like a giant crab became that no I\""]
["02:59,100","03:06,020","\"Hate this world. I thought you just meant like a regular crab became it. No giant. Then he his afterlife is that he\""]
["03:06,020","03:08,820","\"Stomps around in space\""]
["03:09,580","03:14,580","\"Why are there any animal heartless and that sort of sense you tell me buddy\""]
["03:14,580","03:17,300","\"Scar becomes a heartless\""]
["03:17,300","03:20,820","\"I think he's the only character that you get to see become a heartless\""]
["03:20,820","03:26,060","\"But do you kill him yeah\""]
["03:26,060","03:29,180","\"doing uh-huh\""]
["03:29,180","03:34,140","\"You didn't bring true peace to that world then I would not do you corrupted their story line\""]
["03:34,140","03:36,260","\"So I was not supposed to get it true. That's true\""]
["03:36,260","03:39,620","\"It's supposed to be a rule about being a keyblade.\""]
["03:39,620","03:46,260","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["03:46,260","03:48,260","\"He's not just stuck in your head now.\""]
["03:48,260","03:56,260","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["03:56,260","04:00,260","\"I've got a newfound appreciation for real music.\""]
["04:00,260","04:03,260","\"You should do a cover of that song, Chris.\""]
["04:03,260","04:07,260","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["04:07,260","04:08,940","\"Boy, it's just some panic that the one part-\""]
["04:08,940","04:11,500","\"I think someone just found, like, a bike horn on the ground and went.\""]
["04:11,500","04:13,860","\"[MUSIC]\""]
["04:13,860","04:15,460","\"Chris, it's a midi file.\""]
["04:15,460","04:17,980","\"But then they were inspired to write the midi file.\""]
["04:17,980","04:21,360","\"That means they had to actually have something physical that they used in some way.\""]
["04:21,360","04:23,520","\"[LAUGH]\""]
["04:23,520","04:26,780","\"A guy stepped on a bike horn and got stuck to the gum on his shoe.\""]
["04:26,780","04:28,820","\"He started running away from it and played that song.\""]
["04:28,820","04:31,960","\"That's why bass music from Resident Evil, director's guy.\""]
["04:31,960","04:35,320","\"Look out. It's a bug. It's the flapper.\""]
["04:35,320","04:44,200","\"That's a bug. It's dead. What a strange thing to include in your RPG attacking game.\""]
["04:44,200","04:47,960","\"I mean they did it in the first one just because it took up time.\""]
["04:47,960","04:53,640","\"You think that's why it just adds time? I'm glad they at least expanded it into an actual\""]
["04:53,640","04:55,320","\"yeah it's an actual game. You know.\""]
["04:57,240","05:01,480","\"It's still kind of taking your time up a bit, but it's not as for so much.\""]
["05:01,480","05:03,480","\"They came up with fun assets, like.\""]
["05:03,480","05:06,360","\"It's not as bad. It's pretty inoffensive.\""]
["05:06,360","05:09,240","\"They should have actually your kingdom hearts mini game.\""]
["05:09,240","05:13,960","\"The gummy ships in the first one are stinky though, they're boring.\""]
["05:13,960","05:14,520","\"It's true.\""]
["05:14,520","05:14,920","\"Shut up.\""]
["05:14,920","05:18,360","\"Go to the skull world. Thank you.\""]
["05:18,360","05:21,480","\"Where is this giant skull in crossbones?\""]
["05:21,480","05:23,000","\"Oh man, this is ugly already.\""]
["05:23,000","05:26,600","\"That's where Johnny Dev lives.\""]
["05:26,600","05:46,040","\"this is ugly kind of he has to deny that is the ugliest shit don't hold on a shot of that here\""]
["05:46,040","05:53,760","\"while that's the worst thing to be impressed they should not have shown that that's a cool effect the burning how they do that\""]
["05:53,760","05:55,760","\"masking\""]
["05:55,760","06:01,280","\"Jesus fucking Christ somebody's being murdered. Are they gonna show the fucking pillaging?\""]
["06:01,280","06:12,180","\"No, it's just regular people being murdered guys this is olden times it's normal\""]
["06:12,180","06:19,720","\"Okay, okay, okay. It's a map already good get the crown. Oh\""]
["06:19,720","06:24,340","\"My god if you put on that crown you will become Sora bowsett\""]
["06:24,340","06:26,820","\"It's so cool.\""]
["06:26,820","06:27,820","\"So rat.\""]

["06:29,820","06:31,740","\"Me, Trier, Stole.\""]
["06:31,740","06:34,660","\"It came from over there.\""]
["06:34,660","06:38,460","\"Tell me what is your favorite thing about Pirates of the Caribbean?\""]
["06:38,460","06:40,420","\"I like that it's really weird.\""]
["06:40,420","06:42,940","\"That's a good thing to say.\""]
["06:42,940","06:46,700","\"Like even the stuff that people don't like, at least it's creative and interesting.\""]
["06:46,700","06:48,340","\"I like the first one a lot.\""]
["06:48,340","06:49,340","\"What?\""]
["06:49,340","06:50,340","\"Thanks to the curse put on it.\""]
["06:50,340","06:54,680","\"If you squeeze my nose little white worms come out of it.\""]
["06:54,680","06:56,580","\"I don't like how yellow eyes are.\""]
["06:56,580","06:58,340","\"That's what they look like in the movie.\""]
["06:58,340","07:00,180","\"What the little white worms?\""]
["07:00,180","07:01,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:01,180","07:02,820","\"You guys look uncanny.\""]
["07:02,820","07:04,980","\"Like you're in an uncanny valley.\""]
["07:04,980","07:07,180","\"Not like me.\""]
["07:07,180","07:08,620","\"[Laughs]\""]
["07:08,620","07:10,900","\"I'm stylized in nice looking.\""]
["07:10,900","07:11,660","\"Whoa!\""]
["07:11,660","07:14,180","\"Now I get what you were saying.\""]
["07:14,180","07:16,780","\"Kind of corpse-y here.\""]
["07:16,780","07:18,820","\"Well, if you see two do-\""]
["07:18,820","07:21,260","\"That is a weird thing to have in Kingdom Hearts, isn't it?\""]
["07:21,260","07:25,780","\"They had to do a tie-in with the recent movie, I guess.\""]
["07:25,780","07:29,260","\"But that's kinda scary, though, for a little kid's game.\""]
["07:29,260","07:33,860","\"Well, that's why it's further in the game, alongside the musical number level.\""]
["07:33,860","07:37,380","\"That's true, what a...\""]
["07:37,380","07:39,200","\"Different...\""]
["07:39,200","07:39,700","\"...Frenland.\""]
["07:39,700","07:47,300","\"We're a buncha hunks!\""]
["07:47,300","07:48,300","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:48,300","07:54,080","\"That we won't and would engrave it on your tombstone tombstone their friends already\""]
["07:54,080","08:01,640","\"Man half of you stay here and indulge these cullies. Oh, let's bring me that medallion\""]
["08:01,640","08:04,660","\"It's the song\""]
["08:04,660","08:09,220","\"That's sense for is that the actual song\""]
["08:09,220","08:12,980","\"That is that's just the mp3\""]
["08:15,740","08:17,600","\"Actually, no, it's not it's pretty spot on though\""]
["08:17,600","08:23,380","\"So you're just hurting regular people now. They all look the same\""]
["08:23,380","08:26,440","\"God that's so quick\""]
["08:26,440","08:29,440","\"Fuck it try\""]
["08:29,440","08:34,340","\"Look out\""]
["08:41,260","08:44,940","\"I've brought you to the most horrible place I could think of.\""]
["08:44,940","08:48,260","\"Pete, why are you just standing there? You could actually help them.\""]
["08:48,260","08:50,700","\"Defeat the pioneers.\""]
["08:50,700","08:52,860","\"The irate, high rate.\""]
["08:52,860","08:58,500","\"I can't believe they actually put the music in like that.\""]
["08:58,500","09:01,700","\"That's so cool.\""]
["09:01,700","09:05,860","\"It's a bit refreshing because I remember getting really bored of it in the original\""]
["09:05,860","09:06,860","\"sport.\""]
["09:06,860","09:10,340","\"You know, I don't know why they don't put in more of the actual music from the movies\""]
["09:10,340","09:16,100","\"shit I like to know they're doing some extra effort and having to re-archistrate\""]
["09:16,100","09:19,900","\"it I know but sometimes they're just bland and it's like I prefer like well\""]
["09:19,900","09:32,120","\"you didn't know on that one yeah oh you're a knightly oh god god\""]
["09:32,120","09:38,180","\"Orlando Bloom what's Orlando Bloom doing wow his a low detailed model looks a lot\""]
["09:38,180","09:39,820","\"different from his high detail world.\""]
["09:39,820","09:42,740","\"This is a different character.\""]
["09:42,740","09:43,620","\"It looks fine.\""]
["09:43,620","09:45,460","\"He dies.\""]
["09:45,460","09:49,340","\"Why does it give you first person looking at the enemy before you fight them?\""]
["09:49,340","09:50,780","\"Because you're freaking the fuck out.\""]
["09:50,780","09:53,620","\"They want you to want you to be really invested.\""]
["09:53,620","09:55,180","\"What is this?\""]
["09:55,180","10:00,220","\"You know what?\""]
["10:00,220","10:03,780","\"I do like how goofy all the high detail models up here.\""]
["10:03,780","10:04,940","\"I appreciate it.\""]
["10:04,940","10:05,500","\"They look cool.\""]
["10:05,500","10:06,180","\"I like it too.\""]
["10:07,580","10:12,380","\"It's weird expressive cartoony faces on regular people.\""]
["10:12,380","10:18,940","\"It blows my mind how much better these PS2 models can look than some Xbox 360 games.\""]
["10:18,940","10:21,580","\"No, they knew how to take advantage of these games pretty well.\""]
["10:21,580","10:24,100","\"I think they still hold up pretty decently.\""]
["10:24,100","10:28,780","\"Like when you put that cutscene Orlando Bloom next to Elder Scrolls Oblivion?\""]
["10:28,780","10:30,940","\"It looks way better.\""]
["10:30,940","10:34,900","\"Are you saying Oblivion is not the best looking and best written?\""]
["10:34,900","10:39,660","\"and Skyrim and fall out like and all the new ones too like it still looks better than that\""]
["10:39,660","10:44,820","\"Stylistically Bethesda. I think is like the last place you should be looking for quality. I know\""]
["10:44,820","10:49,740","\"I know it's like low hanging fruit, but it's still it's it's interesting. I know I know I\""]
["10:49,740","10:55,580","\"Just saying it's like you're stacking something that a lot of effort went into against something. We're no effort\""]
["10:55,580","11:00,460","\"I just mean that like like these these are pretty low-poly models. It doesn't look like it\""]
["11:01,020","11:05,940","\"Because if you if you properly properly stylize it and everything you can you can get a lot out of it\""]
["11:05,940","11:08,940","\"Yeah, they look very very good. I\""]
["11:08,940","11:13,900","\"Never really appreciated how good these games can look\""]
["11:13,900","11:19,740","\"I would say that's the one thing that really holds up about them. I still look pretty nice\""]
["11:19,740","11:27,580","\"Yeah fun designs actually source big fucking feet. I didn't say that I\""]
["11:28,860","11:30,860","\"Never even insinuated that part\""]
["11:30,860","11:34,740","\"But if you say so I do I really do\""]
["11:34,740","11:37,460","\"It's the only reason I bought it\""]
["11:37,460","11:43,660","\"There has to be at least 10,000 people who only bought this to jerk up at least over the feet\""]
["11:43,660","11:50,220","\"They saw it. I mean they're right on the right on the cover you get to see it's true. This game is gonna be full of big feet\""]
["11:50,220","11:56,820","\"It's a the front covers that it's a reference to the scene in goofy movie exactly that's what I was gonna tie it into\""]
["11:57,100","11:59,100","\"suckling on his toes\""]
["11:59,100","12:05,280","\"They put a lot of emphasis on goofy's big black beat in that movie black freight\""]
["12:05,280","12:15,040","\"Kind of wanted the bottoms of goofy's feet to be pale like my feet, you know got me pretty mad when that scene came on\""]
["12:15,040","12:21,300","\"Yeah, like I don't want to look at fully black. I said okay kids. We're leaving go to harbor\""]
["12:21,300","12:23,300","\"This was not the answer I was hoping for\""]
["12:23,300","12:52,300","\"to ship a shrinking to fuck her I think and I'll never be able to find her okay she's long gone black pearl is nigh uncatchable best find yourself another girl mate not a very good impression there buddy you what are you doing about the interceptor she's off limits to severely.\""]
["12:52,300","12:57,300","\"I'm going to commandeer then to make a fine pirate.\""]
["12:57,300","12:58,300","\"I'm so stupid.\""]
["12:58,300","12:59,300","\"Yeah, what is that?\""]
["12:59,300","13:02,300","\"What was that progression of expressions?\""]
["13:02,300","13:03,300","\"We'll do it.\""]
["13:03,300","13:06,300","\"That looks pretty good.\""]
["13:06,300","13:09,300","\"Take me with you.\""]
["13:09,300","13:10,300","\"Help me hunt down the blood.\""]
["13:10,300","13:11,300","\"I love you.\""]
["13:11,300","13:13,300","\"Forget her.\""]
["13:13,300","13:15,300","\"That'll have met you.\""]
