["00:12,880","00:16,120","\"Oh, what's in here?\""]
["00:16,120","00:18,720","\"What the fuck?\""]
["00:18,720","00:20,080","\"Oh, this is the treasure room.\""]

["00:26,060","00:26,560","\"There you go.\""]
["00:26,560","00:27,060","\"I was right.\""]
["00:27,060","00:29,140","\"You just had to find them all to get that one.\""]
["00:29,140","00:36,880","\"I would imagine there's one left because I'd be 10. Good job.\""]
["00:36,880","00:41,700","\"There's 25 per level. No.\""]
["00:41,700","00:50,000","\"Why are you so happy about our mystery Chris?\""]
["00:50,000","00:53,660","\"Because you brought it on yourself. There's that much?\""]
["00:53,660","00:57,980","\"Oh my lord. It's hard enough to find these.\""]
["00:57,980","01:01,280","\"Every world is packed with fun stuff to do and by packed I mean\""]
["01:01,280","01:06,960","\"Not really packed. They're really spread out at almost impossible to find because the levels are too big\""]
["01:06,960","01:12,120","\"I\""]
["01:12,120","01:18,760","\"I'm leaving this level. Oh, can you leave? Yeah? Oh, I didn't know that I thought you were I thought you had to get enough things\""]
["01:18,760","01:21,540","\"I think I did everything I could probably do at this point\""]
["01:21,540","01:27,160","\"Maybe I'm wrong about that watch people get mad. I'm sorry everybody\""]
["01:27,160","01:29,400","\"We're playing this the first time I don't know where everything is\""]
["01:29,400","01:32,240","\"That's unacceptable\""]
["01:32,240","01:34,440","\"Kill me you guys have to play games\""]
["01:34,440","01:40,640","\"Completely 100% through first and then do your let's play or I will unsubscribe\""]

["01:59,520","02:00,520","\"I wish.\""]
["02:00,520","02:04,520","\"[Laughter]\""]
["02:04,520","02:08,520","\"I gotta say this hub world area, I'm not too big on.\""]
["02:08,520","02:09,520","\"Why?\""]
["02:09,520","02:13,520","\"Because Banjo-Kazoo is very straightforward and this is very messy.\""]
["02:13,520","02:15,520","\"What do you think of the flower?\""]
["02:15,520","02:31,880","\"Dooku or doku is Dooku but oh doki don't count doki doki panic\""]
["02:31,880","02:35,080","\"Okay, okay, okay in turn today\""]
["02:35,080","02:38,640","\"Get in the fucking red hole\""]
["02:40,640","02:48,740","\"I've heard that one before getting the fucking red hole you it's like a prolapse. Can't you meet shovel knight? Where's he?\""]
["02:48,740","02:52,760","\"There he is. Oh, yeah, look. I'm dying\""]
["02:52,760","02:55,800","\"He's right on\""]
["02:55,800","03:05,200","\"Play new level hang on I gotta spell this thing\""]
["03:05,200","03:07,200","\"Oh\""]
["03:07,200","03:26,240","\"There you go, you're so good you spelled a word I know I know the English language\""]
["03:26,240","03:31,320","\"Believe me listen some people don't I know it what?\""]
["03:33,760","03:39,480","\"Oh, oh, ah, so this is unity. Yes. It looks better\""]
["03:39,480","03:42,540","\"Well, I just made the first level bigger\""]
["03:42,540","03:44,800","\"Really? Yes\""]
["03:44,800","03:51,600","\"Now there's more to get lost in. Yeah, let's do it again. No, you don't sound very happy to be playing it no more\""]
["03:51,600","03:54,800","\"This is you\""]
["03:54,800","04:01,900","\"Says everybody. I mean, that's true. Everybody does say it. Yeah, I'm worried about what the next level is gonna be\""]
["04:01,900","04:06,900","\"What is your solution as to how to make it more interesting?\""]
["04:06,900","04:09,900","\"You close the levels off a lot more like Vanja,\""]
["04:09,900","04:11,900","\"because you leave that you have a much more fixed area,\""]
["04:11,900","04:13,900","\"because that way you have variety everywhere.\""]
["04:13,900","04:15,900","\"You don't have to spread it all out.\""]
["04:15,900","04:17,900","\"You make it a lot more interesting.\""]
["04:17,900","04:19,900","\"You have NPCs actually fit the area too.\""]
["04:19,900","04:20,900","\"What are you doing?\""]
["04:20,900","04:22,900","\"I don't know why there were pig nights.\""]
["04:22,900","04:24,900","\"I'm trying to get up there.\""]
["04:24,900","04:25,900","\"That's a Pokemon.\""]
["04:25,900","04:27,900","\"So just run across it, can't you?\""]
["04:27,900","04:28,900","\"No.\""]
["04:28,900","04:30,900","\"You have to roll across it?\""]
["04:30,900","04:33,620","\"You can't run I'm pretty sure you did run\""]
["04:33,620","04:38,840","\"What oh sometimes it's a slope sometimes it isn't I don't know why\""]
["04:38,840","04:45,540","\"You look you're right in the middle, but I mean this this controls a lot better than banjo because we it's a shame that are\""]
["04:45,540","04:51,000","\"The levels seem to be just way too open easy get lost\""]
["04:51,000","04:54,980","\"He just smashed through that it looks like you're supposed to I\""]
["04:54,980","05:00,740","\"Think you need to break fire. Yeah, you need a bullet thing. Oh, isn't there one right below\""]
["05:00,740","05:01,740","\"below it.\""]
["05:01,740","05:02,740","\"Well I'm up here now.\""]
["05:02,740","05:03,740","\"Alright then.\""]
["05:03,740","05:04,740","\"I'm in.\""]
["05:04,740","05:12,140","\"Yeah, I guess I need fire.\""]
["05:12,140","05:14,740","\"I think there's a bullet thing right underneath it.\""]
["05:14,740","05:15,740","\"A bullet.\""]
["05:15,740","05:16,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:16,740","05:17,740","\"The crystal one.\""]
["05:17,740","05:19,740","\"But my dead friends here too.\""]
["05:19,740","05:20,740","\"Aww.\""]

["05:23,180","05:24,180","\"He's a good good.\""]
["05:24,180","05:25,180","\"Look at the bat.\""]
["05:25,180","05:27,180","\"Oh I'm being hypnotized.\""]
["05:27,180","05:28,180","\"Whoa.\""]
["05:28,180","05:30,180","\"I'm fine.\""]
["05:30,180","05:38,180","\"Is that Tom Kenny doing the homework?\""]
["05:38,180","05:46,340","\"Master platformer right here scream\""]
["05:46,340","05:52,660","\"Wow, I did it. I hit the switch for the thing that I already\""]
["05:52,660","05:56,900","\"Hey, let me in\""]
["05:56,900","06:02,100","\"You need to get the hexagonal. This is not a good hub world.\""]
["06:02,100","06:04,660","\"What are you talking about?\""]
["06:04,660","06:08,020","\"First look at it. It's a mess. What are you talking about?\""]
["06:08,020","06:09,940","\"That's cute.\""]
["06:09,940","06:16,300","\"What does that do? Oh, it makes me vomit.\""]
["06:16,300","06:21,620","\"It looks good. I'm so sorry, Matt.\""]
["06:21,620","06:23,620","\"Put out the fire. Put out the fire.\""]
["06:23,620","06:24,980","\"Why did he say I'm so sorry, Matt?\""]
["06:24,980","06:25,840","\"Because he gets scared.\""]
["06:25,840","06:26,620","\"Oh, vomit.\""]
["06:26,620","06:30,700","\"Do you think he ever rode the vomit comet?\""]
["06:30,700","06:31,560","\"Yes.\""]
["06:31,560","06:34,000","\"Or was he too afraid that he'd be turned into vomit?\""]
["06:34,000","06:37,100","\"Oh, you ran out of water.\""]
["06:37,100","06:41,600","\"Rolling around looks really fun.\""]
["06:41,600","06:44,840","\"Who's the boot?\""]
["06:44,840","06:47,180","\"Is that it?\""]
["06:47,180","06:49,100","\"I'm wondering if the game was just rushed out,\""]
["06:49,100","06:50,440","\"because it kind of feels like it.\""]
["06:50,440","06:52,340","\"It controls really well.\""]
["06:52,840","06:56,400","\"It's just... I don't know, these areas.\""]
["06:56,400","06:58,540","\"Oh.\""]
