["00:17,500","00:18,500","\"Is that a game?\""]
["00:18,500","00:19,500","\"I thought it was like an ATM.\""]
["00:19,500","00:21,500","\"Yeah, I was playing the gate-to-the-m game.\""]
["00:21,500","00:25,500","\"Dude, you know you can put doom on an ATM machine?\""]
["00:25,500","00:26,500","\"Would you sign up for the game-\""]
["00:26,500","00:26,500","\"The game-\""]
["00:26,500","00:27,000","\"The game-\""]
["00:27,000","00:29,500","\"If they made you play a game to take out money every time?\""]
["00:29,500","00:34,840","\"The gamer bank gamer bank. It's a normal bank except it's way harder to make withdrawals\""]
["00:34,840","00:38,500","\"Yeah, if you do good at the game, can you withdraw other people's money? Yeah?\""]
["00:38,500","00:44,580","\"That's what I want. Yeah, if you come first and like pewji. I'd never deposit my money in that bank. I would suck\""]
["00:44,580","00:47,860","\"It'd be kind of a cool gamble. I guess\""]
["00:47,860","00:50,620","\"you could yeah\""]
["00:50,620","00:53,340","\"There's a there's there's ways to like\""]
["00:53,340","00:58,460","\"Kyle actually like he doesn't know play the stock market\""]
["00:58,460","01:01,520","\"But he knows like what to invest in and like magic the gathering\""]
["01:01,520","01:05,840","\"so he actually like is able to kind of like\""]
["01:05,840","01:08,980","\"basically use magic the gathering is like a\""]
["01:08,980","01:13,760","\"Like a trading platform. Yeah, yeah like the same way you use stocks\""]
["01:13,760","01:19,680","\"There's some people who do really weird shit to like make money in the future like\""]
["01:19,680","01:24,640","\"Remember one of my neighbors back in the day. They just they just bought a bunch of like model cars\""]
["01:24,640","01:27,840","\"They're like these are gonna be worth a lot of money someday\""]
["01:27,840","01:34,840","\"Are they? No. Yeah, that's like remember Beanie Babies everyone was like oh Beanie Babies are gonna say valuable\""]
["01:34,840","01:39,600","\"If it was easy to speculate on this shit like there'd be weight, you know\""]
["01:39,600","01:46,440","\"Yeah, it just doesn't make sense. It's like if everybody knows something's gonna be valuable\""]
["01:46,440","01:50,160","\"They'd all buy it and then they don't have it so it wouldn't be valuable\""]
["01:51,040","01:55,880","\"Inherently to me it seems like the most valuable thing you can buy that will never lose its value is like\""]
["01:55,880","02:04,440","\"Ridiculously like rare NES games gold. Yeah like that Nintendo championship game just weird shit like that. Oh\""]
["02:04,440","02:09,720","\"Like if you had the additions from like the tournaments they held in the 80s or something\""]
["02:09,720","02:15,640","\"Apparently they sell for like 40 grand or something because what there's only like 10 copies in existence. Yeah\""]
["02:18,120","02:24,820","\"Yeah, I would assume like that era to like I don't know if that's like gone now like I don't know if like the fallout\""]
["02:24,820","02:31,900","\"The fallout for like collectors edition is gonna be worth anything now. There's no way 20 years from now\""]
["02:31,900","02:37,740","\"But something like Mario. It's it's so kind of evergreen. Yeah that like earthbound\""]
["02:37,740","02:46,400","\"This thing that's only a million American copies of earth phone or worth anything because it sold and was produced in way\""]
["02:46,400","02:51,540","\"higher quantities in Japan. The reason Earth Bunso valuables because it did\""]
["02:51,540","02:55,880","\"horribly here commercially so they didn't make a lot. It's always been weird to me\""]
["02:55,880","03:00,620","\"though is like just with like resolutions and stuff being what they are.\""]
["03:00,620","03:05,520","\"Like if you plug like an NES into say this TV that we're watching right now\""]
["03:05,520","03:11,360","\"it would look like shit. Yeah. So I don't know. Like I don't know why those\""]
["03:11,360","03:15,320","\"things hold value the way that they do. Especially like they're not making CRTs\""]
["03:15,320","03:22,840","\"anymore are they? I don't know. Yeah, only maybe for specialty industries. I bet\""]
["03:22,840","03:27,400","\"whatever CRTs you can still buy are really expensive. Yeah, I'm surprised they're\""]
["03:27,400","03:32,280","\"really advanced to that. There's probably like some and whoa, what's going on?\""]
["03:32,280","03:37,200","\"Air glide through it, I suppose. Yeah, there's probably some enthusiast market\""]
["03:37,200","03:41,760","\"where like you can go on Etsy and some guy will make you a CRT TV, right? Probably.\""]
["03:41,760","03:47,040","\"make you a man that guy right there hard to make in like a homework show that's\""]
["03:47,040","03:52,400","\"the guy who does it jumps out at you like that that's Homer don't you know\""]
["03:52,400","03:56,920","\"and me I mean I don't I'm I'm no electrical engineer but I think you need\""]
["03:56,920","04:00,880","\"a very special environment to build like vacuum tubes and see you just buy\""]
["04:00,880","04:05,000","\"vacuum tubes though look I do not know a lot of old technology\""]
["04:05,000","04:13,080","\"edge commentary. Get rid of this. Okay. Fuck me. You mean this guy that makes the CRT TVs\""]
["04:13,080","04:20,200","\"who you hate? No. Fuck that guy. So you absolutely loathe this man. Just me talking about shit\""]
["04:20,200","04:27,280","\"at the literal edge of my understanding of technology. The literal edge. Alright. You\""]
["04:27,280","04:34,240","\"got the kablui. Was this thing like a rocket launcher? That did not answer my question.\""]
["04:34,240","04:40,880","\"Look like a cub that looked like a chalk gun. Oh, there you go. There's fires little fires. I don't know\""]
["04:40,880","04:43,240","\"Well, that seems like the lamest thing of every I don't yeah\""]

["04:45,680","04:48,840","\"I don't know a lile really seems like you're kind of overcompensating\""]
["04:48,840","04:53,280","\"I want to see what happens when it hits this dude. Yeah, I want to see what happens when it hits that dude, too. Oh\""]
["04:53,280","05:00,160","\"Oh, they detonate. Oh, it's what it this is too much work. So it's a little sticky grenades\""]

["05:03,840","05:11,720","\"So what tell me exactly how they made that sound effect\""]
["05:11,720","05:17,240","\"They they killed 50 million rats\""]
["05:17,240","05:23,320","\"Oh\""]
["05:23,320","05:25,280","\"It was exactly on the 50 millionth rat\""]
["05:26,320","05:33,340","\"I wish that was the exact science of like Foley versus like you just so how many rats did you kill to make this sound like?\""]
["05:33,340","05:36,520","\"17,000 what about this one like 600 million\""]
["05:36,520","05:45,180","\"Rats are like the raw resource of sound they can make the only way you can discover new sounds in the universe anymore is killing\""]
["05:45,180","05:52,200","\"myriad rats rat holocaust with like 10,000 shotgun mics placed everywhere\""]
["05:52,200","05:55,680","\"It's awesome\""]
["05:55,680","06:00,680","\"I'm glad you knew how that was made, Delmar, because you would have looked a fool if you\""]
["06:00,680","06:04,600","\"didn't know the exact method by which that sound is created.\""]
["06:04,600","06:05,600","\"Killing rats.\""]
