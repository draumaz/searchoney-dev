["09:20,460","09:22,960","\"they go together, they stack,\""]
["09:22,960","09:24,560","\"for whatever reason, as a bug.\""]
["09:24,560","09:28,160","\"So it just keeps doing more and more damage and giving him more and more health.\""]
["09:28,160","09:30,960","\"And it's just really really good if you end up doing that.\""]
["09:30,960","09:32,560","\"That was the only reason I picked him.\""]
["09:32,560","09:34,260","\"And we fucked up.\""]
