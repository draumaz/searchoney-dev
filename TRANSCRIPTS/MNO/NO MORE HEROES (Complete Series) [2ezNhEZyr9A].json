["14:32,980","14:36,680","\"But the second one was also out at the time\""]
["14:36,680","14:39,720","\"So I think I was just kind of like impatient to get through it\""]

["14:51,720","14:57,180","\"I think I kind of like part of the reason I didn't really dig half life - was because I also sort of had that mindset\""]

["15:36,240","15:38,240","\"I bet those are like way better\""]
["15:38,240","15:42,280","\"So I kind of I kind of just like you fuck yourself. The episodes are just more of the same\""]

["15:44,500","15:48,720","\"I don't change it at all when I'm half-life - I never actually got under the other episodes\""]
["15:48,720","15:51,480","\"They always got bored like really quickly. I don't think I beat them\""]
["15:51,480","15:54,960","\"I think I was like I was expecting basically like a half-life three\""]

["49:36,760","49:46,320","\"Sorry go on I'm sorry for ruining your story. No, no, I mean that I think that's a regular person as much as I love them\""]
["49:46,320","49:50,680","\"I think that they didn't really understand the premise of Norbit because they didn't even know that\""]
["49:50,680","49:54,500","\"They didn't even know that Eddie Murphy was also the fat lady\""]
["49:54,500","49:58,660","\"I've literally never seen Norbit, but I knew it was about Eddie Murphy being a really fat woman\""]
["49:58,660","50:03,860","\"Yeah, Eddie Murphy is a fat woman and he's a skinny man Chris Chris quick you gotta go kill the target and he's a clump\""]
["50:03,860","50:06,740","\"Both norbits are Eddie Murphy the target Chris. Oh\""]
["50:06,740","50:09,380","\"No\""]
["50:09,380","50:13,460","\"You're really determined to kill everybody but the guy you're supposed to be killing\""]
["50:13,460","50:16,980","\"Oh, there's a timer. Yeah\""]
["50:16,980","50:21,540","\"I can show you my norbit\""]
["50:21,540","50:27,220","\"But Chris my little norbit. I've actually never seen norbit. You guys seen that. No, I haven't seen it either\""]
["50:27,220","50:33,280","\"I remember I saw the trailer and I said that looks like it might ruin all other media for me if I see it\""]
["50:33,280","50:36,620","\"It'll be too good. Yeah, that's that's also what I said\""]
["50:36,620","50:40,740","\"Well, we're cut from the same loincloth exactly\""]
["50:40,740","50:45,300","\"I don't I don't like what Norbit will do to me sexually\""]
["50:45,300","50:50,020","\"I don't like what it'll do for my standards. It'll make you physically repulsive. I\""]
["50:50,020","50:52,700","\"Think Norbit would change me\""]
["50:52,700","50:55,460","\"For the better. I don't know\""]
["50:56,140","50:58,140","\"Let's just pray we never find out\""]
["50:58,140","51:06,840","\"Okay, I'm glad to know that even when you know how to play this fucking game that still happens to you know that guy\""]
["51:06,840","51:12,740","\"That's why I don't like motion control shit doesn't work like one third of the time. It's really fucking annoying\""]
["51:12,740","51:16,440","\"You know it works pretty well like I've got a fucking\""]
["51:16,440","51:20,880","\"Oculus yeah, and it works like a hundred percent of the time on that\""]
["51:21,420","51:24,580","\"Yeah, so like what those games are designed around it better\""]
["51:24,580","51:30,340","\"What if they tapped into for those that they didn't hear just the Wii remotes weren't that great like yeah\""]
["51:30,340","51:35,180","\"Yeah, no the Wii was just like whatever and then they had the Wii Plus and it was a little slightly better\""]
["51:35,180","51:38,980","\"No the Wii Plus is actually a lot better. Yeah, but we're playing on the switch and right\""]
["51:38,980","51:43,700","\"But should be a lot lot better right but this game is like programmed\""]
["51:43,700","51:48,800","\"For Wii so it's using that style of shit. Maybe they should have made it better\""]
["51:49,540","51:51,540","\"The budget studio guys come on\""]
["51:51,540","51:55,900","\"You keep saying that but you won't prove it. I\""]
["51:55,900","52:00,980","\"Literally look at the soul game. I think it's great. I think it looks good for the time. I think yeah\""]
["52:00,980","52:06,580","\"I mean looks like it came out 2006. Am I wrong? Am I right? You're pretty many right? It's like 2007 Wow\""]
["52:06,580","52:08,980","\"So you can you nailed it\""]
["52:08,980","52:11,980","\"That's the line between an insult and an accurate assessment\""]
["52:11,980","52:18,460","\"That one year I mean you crossed it was pretty on the spot though\""]
["52:19,180","52:24,300","\"You guys feel sad when people insult stuff by saying it looks like a ps2 game. No, I love the ps2 aesthetic\""]
["52:24,300","52:26,080","\"Yeah, but I feel like when people say like ew\""]
["52:26,080","52:29,180","\"This looks like a ps2 game that makes me feel sad actually\""]
["52:29,180","52:36,760","\"I think I think the ps1 has the best aesthetic ps2 has second best ps3 it starts getting gross and ps4 starts getting good again\""]
["52:36,760","52:41,700","\"I would say the ps3 is gross, but I really like the way demon souls look so I think just everyone else did it wrong\""]
["52:41,700","52:43,700","\"But them I think demon souls\""]
["52:44,100","52:49,380","\"Actually looks awful, but the atmosphere and the colors just seem to work for some reason\""]
["52:49,380","52:55,420","\"Like the models themselves really don't look good in that game, but I disagree\""]
["52:55,420","52:59,260","\"It's one of those three. No, but I agree with you slightly. It's it's that\""]
["52:59,260","53:04,300","\"It's one of those things where your brain fills in the blanks because there's less detail\""]
["53:04,300","53:07,220","\"That's fair. I\""]
["53:07,220","53:12,260","\"Think on a technical level. Yeah doesn't look great, but I still prefer how it looks over the new one\""]
["53:12,260","53:17,560","\"Okay, the new one has more poly guns, but the designs are ruined. I think if you look at like\""]
["53:17,560","53:24,520","\"Shitty shovelware for the ps2 like that is a really ugly like if you play like mission impossible or something\""]
["53:24,520","53:30,080","\"Yeah, like that is a super ugly era for when stuff was trying to be like here. You look it's real people\""]
["53:30,080","53:35,400","\"Certain things just yeah, it depends on how stylized they are like I think this looks really good\""]
["53:35,400","53:40,760","\"Yeah, this is my favorite aesthetic like the kind of anime ps2 era like resible for love it\""]
["53:40,760","53:47,280","\"Yeah, no this stuff is awesome. I miss this it's always Capcom shit. What is this? This isn't Capcom is it? No\""]
["53:47,280","53:49,280","\"This is graph up manufacturer\""]
["53:49,280","53:55,180","\"I also like old Sega arcade shit. Yeah, that stuff is very very looks beautiful\""]
["53:55,180","54:02,320","\"Yeah, I like good sprite art good that that I think is aged better than most like 3d graphics have\""]
["54:02,320","54:05,040","\"Everyone loves some good sprite art\""]
["54:05,040","54:09,720","\"Who doesn't I'll kick their ass exactly. Thank you Lyle\""]
["54:09,720","54:17,000","\"I like how ape escape one looked. Apes Eve one looks so fucking good. You literally so so so good\""]
["54:17,000","54:19,000","\"Or I'm gonna take a quick shit\""]
["54:19,000","54:22,160","\"Apes Eve one has also\""]
["54:22,160","54:33,560","\"The sigh immediately after the you're gonna fill up your memory card if you keep fucking taking those the block in your memory card\""]

["55:17,340","55:25,000","\"That way I didn't know that was universal I was just joking, but you showed your true colors this day\""]
["55:25,000","55:29,280","\"Yeah, my colors are red white and blue the French flag then motherfucker\""]
["55:29,280","55:36,700","\"No, I've actually like I had French people pretend that they don't know to speak English near me when I asked them shit\""]
["55:36,700","55:40,320","\"And then I'll hear them having conversations in English when I walk away from them\""]
["55:40,320","55:46,900","\"That's actually fucking real if I had that happen. I would fucking stick my finger up my ass to the knuckle\""]

["01:34:03,100","01:34:08,600","\"But as I was running through the cave and killing my 47 millionth goblin\""]
