["00:39,080","00:43,040","\"because you want to get a hundred for like, if you get an A in everything, you get 600, basically.\""]
["00:43,040","00:45,800","\"Uh, I got fucking 350.\""]

["01:03,600","01:07,520","\"and you get handed out pieces of paper, right?\""]
["01:07,520","01:11,280","\"And they put a fucking radio on a table and they push play, and you listen to Irish.\""]
["01:11,280","01:13,840","\"Oh yeah, yeah, where it's like, \"\"Colum estanam dum.\"\"\""]
["01:13,840","01:16,880","\"Yeah, and you answer questions while listening to this Irish tape.\""]
["01:16,880","01:18,560","\"So one of the questions on the thing will be like,\""]
["01:18,560","01:19,840","\"\"\"What does Mary like to do?\"\"\""]
["01:19,840","01:21,280","\"And it'll ask you that in Irish.\""]
["01:21,280","01:22,560","\"And then you'll have to listen to the tape,\""]
["01:22,560","01:24,400","\"and then you'll have to write down the answer in Irish.\""]
["01:24,400","01:25,120","\"What is he right?\""]
["01:25,120","01:30,880","\"But that's the thing for my Irish oral I couldn't hear a single thing because the fucking radio was like\""]

["01:37,120","01:41,960","\"And I was like I was like whispering to the people next to me be like can you can you fucking hear this and you're like yeah?\""]
["01:41,960","01:46,460","\"Yeah, we had to like decipher it from from a radio and speak it in Irish\""]
["01:46,460","01:51,320","\"Yeah, but the radio was a piece of shit and it had only base and no treble or mid so it was literally\""]
["01:52,840","01:57,760","\"And I was like I can't fucking hear it. I was shitting my pants. So I literally was just writing down bullshit\""]
["01:57,760","02:03,660","\"Actual bullshit that made no sense and I passed oh wait you passed I don't know how I passed I should have failed\""]
["02:03,660","02:10,480","\"I don't know how I passed fucking Irish. They try to pass you I think they do too cuz I I think if you fail Irish\""]
["02:10,480","02:15,200","\"Like if you fail one exam you have to repeat the years net. Oh no if you fail Irish\""]
["02:15,200","02:20,860","\"English or Matt's you have to repeat the year. No college will let you in yeah, which is fucking bullshit\""]
["02:20,860","02:24,500","\"Yeah, I think it's bullshit that you have to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life when you're like 17\""]
["02:24,500","02:28,580","\"Yeah, and that they don't let you do it if you fail fucking Irish of all things\""]

["06:16,720","06:18,480","\"off the internet, except for me, I was just like,\""]
["06:18,480","06:19,600","\"no, I'm not holding on.\""]
["06:19,600","06:22,240","\"So for fucking three years, I didn't know how to do it.\""]
["06:22,240","06:24,680","\"And that's all we did in British class,\""]
["06:24,680","06:26,520","\"in business class was sit down and do those over\""]
["06:26,520","06:30,640","\"over and over and all I did was draw on pieces of paper and slip them into his pocket with\""]

["06:31,640","06:32,640","\"What?\""]
["06:32,640","06:33,640","\"And he just didn't care.\""]
["06:33,640","06:37,760","\"One time I did that ever tell you about the little thing I got in Las Vegas, this\""]

["06:48,920","06:52,880","\"He was too much of a pussy to enforce discipline.\""]
["06:52,880","06:56,040","\"So he didn't teach you anything, but he also didn't get mad at you for doing anything.\""]
["06:56,040","07:01,200","\"It was kind of like I was legitimately like Bart Simpson of the class like that same teacher the long guy\""]
["07:01,200","07:05,540","\"You would turn around and I throw like a wet tissue at him and I threw it at the whiteboard\""]
["07:05,540","07:07,460","\"And it's going every time you turn around\""]
["07:07,460","07:11,780","\"I'll just stick to it and you guys and everyone knew it was me like he knew it was me because of the only one who would do that\""]

["07:23,760","07:26,480","\"Now you're an asshole your monster. I was a cunt\""]
["07:26,480","07:32,560","\"Everyone did not like me in my first second and third year because I was just some fucking video game fanatic\""]
["07:32,560","07:35,680","\"And then you're that kid and then in fourth year\""]
["07:35,680","07:39,360","\"Everyone moved on and I could stay behind because I just wanted to do fourth years\""]
["07:39,360","07:43,040","\"Just a free year where you can do anything you want so you don't have to like do stuff\""]
["07:43,040","07:46,800","\"I was like I'm gonna do that because all those other guys are gonna move on and none of them like me\""]
["07:46,800","07:52,040","\"And then when in fifth year came I just shut up and didn't say anything and everyone started fucking loving me\""]
["07:52,320","07:58,200","\"And it changed my fucking food chain placement the exact opposite thing happened to me in fourth year as well\""]
