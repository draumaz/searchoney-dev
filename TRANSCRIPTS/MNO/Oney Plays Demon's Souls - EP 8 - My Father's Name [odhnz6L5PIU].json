["08:41,180","08:43,060","\"but do you wanna do any of that, or should we just use them?\""]
["08:43,060","08:44,060","\"- Are any of them cool?\""]
["08:44,060","08:45,820","\"Or should we just cash 'em in?\""]
["08:45,820","08:47,340","\"I mean, I usually just cash 'em in.\""]
["08:47,340","08:48,380","\"- Just cash 'em, dog.\""]

["09:03,500","09:06,580","\"And then Infinite has like the worst of it all.\""]
["09:06,580","09:09,100","\"Yeah, like this story is super interesting and infinite,\""]
["09:09,100","09:10,820","\"but like gameplay wise, it's just,\""]
["09:10,820","09:14,680","\"they dumbed it down and it just, it feels weird, feels bad.\""]
["09:14,680","09:16,340","\"I'm sorry they did that to your series.\""]

["09:43,340","09:44,660","\"- You shouldn't say you're wrong\""]

["09:56,500","09:57,540","\"- No, I totally get it.\""]

["10:00,740","10:02,020","\"oh yeah, I don't even like infinite,\""]

["10:14,420","10:17,260","\"What did we, we needed strength to go up\""]
["10:17,260","10:18,860","\"just because we want it,\""]
["10:18,860","10:20,900","\"but also so we could wield that container.\""]
["10:20,900","10:22,100","\"- And Uchi Kukuna.\""]
["10:22,100","10:23,980","\"- Yeah, the Uchi Kattoochi.\""]
["10:23,980","10:24,820","\"- Oh, yeah.\""]

["10:50,420","10:53,660","\"I'm pretty sure you can go over level 100 in this one.\""]
["10:53,660","10:54,660","\"So I'm not sure.\""]
["10:54,660","10:57,660","\"But it, 'cause is it like Dark Souls or Bloodborne\""]
["10:57,660","10:59,380","\"where it reaches a soft cap\""]
["10:59,380","11:01,640","\"where it stops doing nearly as much.\""]
["11:01,640","11:04,120","\"'Cause I know in Bloodborne it's like 40 or something.\""]
["11:04,120","11:05,380","\"- I'm not with my wife, but I would.\""]
["11:05,380","11:07,280","\"- Yeah, I have no idea, honestly.\""]
