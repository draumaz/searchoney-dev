["00:06,100","00:09,200","\"Aww, it's like, I wasn't even a little bit out of the way.\""]
["00:09,200","00:11,600","\"I guess you got to bait him a little tiny bit and run back.\""]
["00:11,600","00:14,000","\"It almost looks like he's wearing sunglasses, but...\""]
["00:14,000","00:16,000","\"It's just shaded like that.\""]
["00:16,000","00:17,600","\"I kind of...\""]
["00:17,600","00:20,000","\"I kind of miss, uh, in the first few Souls games,\""]
["00:20,000","00:23,200","\"there was no anime hair, which made it seem a little more.\""]
["00:23,200","00:26,800","\"It's kind of hilarious, but also, yeah.\""]
["00:26,800","00:29,100","\"It, like, they seem very European.\""]
["00:29,100","00:30,540","\"Yeah, that's what I prefer.\""]
["00:30,540","00:33,260","\"Yeah, it's like medieval fantasy, right?\""]
["00:33,260","00:36,700","\"Yeah, well, that was a bad sign from the beginning of Dark Souls 2.\""]
["00:36,700","00:38,140","\"They had like Vegeta hair from the get-go.\""]
["00:38,140","00:41,340","\"Dark Souls 2, I think we can all agree, is the worst Souls game.\""]
["00:41,340","00:45,340","\"You know what? I think you're gonna get a lot of death threats, but maybe.\""]
["00:45,340","00:48,340","\"Gameplay-wise, I had some cool stuff, but then it made dumb decisions,\""]
["00:48,340","00:52,140","\"and all of the areas just seemed uninspired and like, just dumb.\""]
["00:52,140","00:55,460","\"Yeah, for me it was just kinda like...\""]
["00:55,460","00:57,460","\"Just didn't feel authentic in any way.\""]
["00:57,460","01:03,480","\"No, all right. Do I just beat the dragon? I'm back run back now. Look forward now run run dude\""]
["01:03,480","01:09,420","\"This sound the dragon makes is so good. Yeah, it's cool. Watch them just fly our oak dude. You're dead\""]

["01:57,180","01:59,780","\"I want to try to parry this dick.\""]
["01:59,780","02:00,860","\"Come on.\""]
["02:00,860","02:01,420","\"What do you got?\""]
["02:01,420","02:06,660","\"So much in my dark souls so that every animation is purely physics base.\""]
["02:06,660","02:07,620","\"That will make it better.\""]
["02:07,620","02:09,460","\"That'd be so shaky.\""]
["02:09,460","02:12,460","\"All right.\""]
["02:12,460","02:14,020","\"Nice grass.\""]
["02:14,020","02:15,660","\"It's fucking dragons loud dude.\""]
["02:15,660","02:16,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:16,380","02:17,620","\"It is.\""]
["02:17,620","02:22,180","\"Oh, that's a sweet view of the dragon though.\""]
["02:22,180","02:23,180","\"I like that.\""]
["02:23,180","02:26,540","\"Man, the range on the sword sucks.\""]
["02:26,540","02:27,540","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:27,540","02:28,700","\"At least it's power-tho.\""]
["02:28,700","02:31,980","\"Makes me feel like a real man.\""]
["02:31,980","02:32,980","\"Oh my god.\""]
["02:32,980","02:33,980","\"Yeah, this was...\""]
["02:33,980","02:36,940","\"For 2009, this was nuts.\""]
["02:36,940","02:37,940","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:37,940","02:39,580","\"Oh, you got your first magic wand.\""]
["02:39,580","02:40,580","\"Who cares, right?\""]
["02:40,580","02:41,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:41,580","02:42,580","\"I...\""]
["02:42,580","02:45,060","\"In Dark Souls, I never fucked with magic, like ever.\""]
["02:45,060","02:46,060","\"Um...\""]
["02:46,060","02:50,940","\"I like bloodborne because it barely has any sort of magic stuff and my first game of dark souls\""]
["02:50,940","02:56,340","\"I remember I leveled up my magic really high and I had a bunch of spells and then I\""]
["02:56,340","02:58,700","\"Thought that the more you leveled up the more\""]
["02:58,700","03:05,640","\"Spell usage you would have but it wasn't the case and then I didn't know about magical weapons and that leveling up your magic\""]
["03:05,640","03:10,220","\"Stat would level up your magical weapons attacks that right that the scaling and all of that\""]
["03:10,220","03:13,400","\"Yes, I was like I had no idea what the fuck I was doing, so I thought it was just shit\""]
["03:14,940","03:21,500","\"Yeah, that's the game where it's like I eventually realized I had no shame looking up shit every second that I was like\""]
["03:21,500","03:23,500","\"How does this work? Yeah?\""]
["03:23,500","03:30,480","\"It would have been cool playing their souls back in like the no internet days even like that completely contradicts itself\""]
["03:30,480","03:31,420","\"Because it's an internet game\""]
["03:31,420","03:32,060","\"That's the whole point\""]
["03:32,060","03:37,300","\"But it would have been cool like discovering the world with no internet and just like telling friends about it\""]
["03:37,300","03:43,100","\"We're you know of mouth and shit. Yeah, like you just go to school like ocarina of time style. Yeah, I found this out\""]
["03:43,340","03:46,960","\"So cool. Yeah, it would have been crazy hard though\""]
["03:46,960","03:56,300","\"Definitely would have needed the primer strategy good the pre-com strategy cut a ring of what?\""]
["03:56,300","03:58,820","\"Check that I didn't say rash resistance\""]
["03:58,820","04:05,620","\"Become harder for enemies to attack including yeah sure\""]
["04:05,620","04:08,180","\"Let's not be a bitch on yeah, I don't like blood\""]
["04:08,180","04:13,180","\"That's fair what makes me uneasy you're going there anyway\""]
