["02:45,840","02:47,160","\"You just feel real loose, you know?\""]
["02:47,160","02:49,000","\"Real free listening to this.\""]

["02:51,360","02:52,760","\"Whatever, I'll come back to it.\""]
["02:52,760","02:53,920","\"- That version's good.\""]
["02:53,920","02:55,200","\"I like that one.\""]

["03:15,320","03:16,640","\"Y and X specifically.\""]
["03:16,640","03:17,560","\"- 'Cause it'd be horrifying.\""]
["03:17,560","03:18,640","\"- Would you trap-- - You probably would.\""]
["03:18,640","03:20,360","\"- Would you trap Peter Mullinew inside of giant cube.\""]

["03:21,500","03:23,480","\"- In there, okay. - How about a giant egg?\""]
["03:23,480","03:24,720","\"Would you trap Peter Mullinew inside of giant egg?\""]
["03:24,720","03:26,360","\"- To make it more horrifying.\""]
["03:26,360","03:28,720","\"- From the inside, they're like banging on the walls\""]
["03:28,720","03:31,160","\"and they can see outside and it's getting,\""]
["03:31,160","03:33,440","\"time is flowing backwards and they're gonna go\""]
["03:33,440","03:34,280","\"into a chicken.\""]
["03:34,280","03:35,720","\"- That's horrible.\""]

["03:36,640","03:41,240","\"- Julian. - Put me Peter Mullinew in there.\""]
["03:41,240","03:42,720","\"- What would you do if you pulled in your pants\""]
["03:42,720","03:43,920","\"to go to the bathroom,\""]
["03:43,920","03:45,440","\"but instead of your penis and balls,\""]
["03:45,440","03:47,920","\"there was an egg connected to your body.\""]
["03:47,920","03:52,040","\"And it was like, just a normal chicken egg.\""]
["03:52,040","03:55,040","\"- Like I can feel it and like I can feel that it would break.\""]
["03:55,040","03:55,880","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:55,880","03:56,920","\"That would be very stressful.\""]
["03:56,920","03:58,680","\"I wouldn't want a part of me to break like that.\""]
["03:58,680","04:00,120","\"That would be sick.\""]
["04:00,120","04:03,220","\"- Who replaced my junk with bunk?\""]
["04:03,220","04:07,480","\"- Eggsy.\""]
["04:07,480","04:09,960","\"He's like the Banksy, but instead of tattoos,\""]
["04:09,960","04:11,800","\"he turns stuff into eggs.\""]
["04:11,800","04:12,800","\"- Oh no, Roxas.\""]
["04:12,800","04:14,800","\"Fox says\""]
["04:14,800","04:19,480","\"So why do you remember that so are you\""]
["04:19,480","04:25,120","\"Nobody doesn't that mean he doesn't feel anger. Oh fuck it. Whatever\""]
["04:25,120","04:32,640","\"I'm goofy and I'm sick of this. I I don't know the other way to take it would be like okay\""]
["04:32,640","04:38,140","\"So we all think they don't have feelings, but they actually do have feelings and so you we were wrong about them\""]
["04:38,140","04:42,560","\"But they don't do that either I I don't know cuz I haven't played the later games. I need to\""]
["04:42,560","04:48,140","\"I don't think they talk about nobody's in any of those other games. I feel like this is the only one\""]
["04:48,140","04:51,200","\"That's not true because that was the whole thing\""]
["04:51,200","04:54,820","\"I think they go into isn't that one of the follow-ups that you explore\""]
["04:54,820","04:57,700","\"Axel and Roxas with\""]
["04:57,700","05:04,880","\"Kyrie's oh that yeah, what am I saying? There's the DS game. Yeah, I think they explore that later on so they might go into that\""]
["05:04,880","05:08,320","\"Hey at the time of King of Hearts - though it doesn't make any sense\""]
["05:08,320","05:11,600","\"I would say but if they go into it later sure I guess\""]
["05:11,600","05:17,720","\"Then again, I think that's what they do with everything because Kingdom Hearts 2 kind of created a mess for the story left\""]
["05:17,720","05:21,280","\"It's true. They had a pretty tight story. We didn't need to overcomplicate it\""]
["05:21,280","05:26,500","\"And now they're sort of doing a lot of sequels for damage control report 3. I\""]
["05:26,500","05:31,000","\"Heard the PSP one's really fun though. I do want to play through it\""]
["05:31,000","05:35,760","\"What do you think this weird dimension is supposed to be? I know this moment\""]
["05:35,760","05:38,200","\"Are we gonna see our friend soon?\""]
["05:39,600","05:46,360","\"Our gay friend is coming over to visit. I want to see him. Oh, we couldn't beat five of them. It's no use\""]
["05:46,360","05:51,800","\"Wait, I was literally like five of them. Who's that cool?\""]
["05:51,800","06:01,780","\"Oh, no, oh they stepped on him\""]
["06:07,240","06:09,240","\"So no, I'm not okay\""]
["06:09,240","06:18,440","\"Try being a little more sensitive got it memorized. Oh, he actually said hey, you piece of shit. Oh\""]
["06:18,440","06:20,560","\"My god, no\""]
["06:20,560","06:22,280","\"Not a dusk\""]
["06:22,280","06:27,040","\"That's the weakest form of nobody and you got stepped on by one. So what does that make you? Oh?\""]
["06:27,040","06:29,280","\"No\""]
["06:29,280","06:32,560","\"Where it would happen to son old and doofy son of a\""]
["06:32,560","06:35,960","\"Long Simon\""]
["06:35,960","06:40,280","\"Oh my god. Has anyone done that yet that they got all your names mixed up?\""]
["06:40,280","06:48,160","\"Jorah, Donald and Goofy. Actually it's sort of Donald and Goofy. Oh, so your names are\""]
["06:48,160","07:02,040","\"sort of Donald and Goofy. No, I mean, yes. Don't talk to him. He doesn't say much that's\""]
["07:02,040","07:08,640","\"Meaningful I was about to say that the phrase Sora Donald and goofy has become so ubiquitous in this game that like you could make a\""]
["07:08,640","07:12,980","\"Computer password out of it and then I remembered that they actually did that that was the Tron thing\""]
["07:12,980","07:20,720","\"I'll correct in a character where they say Donald Sora goofy no no that's sort Donald goofy\""]
["07:20,720","07:24,640","\"You have to have a specific inflection say it right\""]
["07:24,640","07:29,580","\"Can you know hearts should drop Disney shit and do dream work shit\""]
["07:30,400","07:36,120","\"How would you feel if they did that as a business decision to go to shark tail they wouldn't do it's - it's too wrapped up\""]
["07:36,120","07:40,480","\"And that they're not that would never happen shut up Julian. Just shut up. Let me have it have it\""]
["07:40,480","07:44,880","\"I want to go. Oh my god. I want to go to over the hedge\""]
["07:44,880","07:50,960","\"Yeah for what I\""]

["08:05,680","08:12,560","\"Wow it be a shame of something oh\""]
["08:12,560","08:15,120","\"but oh oh\""]

["08:19,000","08:21,840","\"Well\""]
["08:21,840","08:25,480","\"That's what happens when you put your whole being into an attack\""]
["08:26,080","08:31,840","\"It's like you didn't have to do that. Those are the weakest enemies, you know, I could have hit them\""]
["08:31,840","08:35,660","\"Anyway, I digress\""]
["08:35,660","08:37,160","\"Go\""]

["09:33,820","09:42,460","\"Little cold-hearted all right. He probably knows I'm sure he knows I\""]
["09:42,460","09:49,060","\"Love what he probably and then you stole his keychain off of his disintegrating body\""]

["10:02,260","10:06,420","\"It's how poured into this room\""]
["10:06,420","10:09,100","\"Can you two shut this duck off?\""]
["10:09,100","10:15,740","\"I would like them to walk in and just like hear that hear the whole room from a real verbiack oe\""]
["10:16,820","10:23,820","\"perspective. Yeah. It's what my cutscenes from earlier, but now you're in the room and you can hear them from up above. And nobody notices them walk in.\""]
["10:23,820","10:32,820","\"Because you're so far down in the room that can't see down to you. They're too busy arguing about nothing. So they just push the chairs over and kill them all.\""]
["10:32,820","10:37,820","\"Then perhaps he's got his non-existence. He's known as you, guys.\""]
["10:37,820","10:39,820","\"He came out of winter.\""]
["10:39,820","10:45,820","\"We say confusing things because this is a confusing concept. I don't get it.\""]
["10:45,820","10:48,980","\"He won nothing and is nothing\""]
["10:48,980","10:55,940","\"He couldn't stand the emptiness of being without a heart and that led to his demise\""]
["10:55,940","11:02,460","\"That's pretty sad stuff. I think his demise is because he blew himself up actually\""]
["11:02,460","11:08,580","\"As the power to is he gone forever now as far as I know that's fucked\""]
["11:08,580","11:13,780","\"I'm sure he'll be back in three. I haven't played the later games. You know\""]
