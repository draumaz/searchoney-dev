["00:44,640","00:47,480","\"- Chris, you were talking about doing ROM hacks,\""]
["00:47,480","00:49,840","\"just do a ROM hack where Freddy Freaker is not for us.\""]
["00:49,840","00:51,200","\"- Fucking wish.\""]

["00:58,200","01:01,900","\"Yeah, the background music is just the commercial over and over.\""]
["01:01,900","01:04,100","\"It would be the best.\""]
["01:04,100","01:05,500","\"You have to get a choir to do it.\""]
["01:05,500","01:08,400","\"One, four, nine, hundred, hundred, hundred.\""]
["01:08,400","01:11,700","\"Oh, no, I'm not concentrating.\""]

["01:14,000","01:15,900","\"Okay, where is he?\""]
["01:15,900","01:18,100","\"Julian, this is the hardest fight in the game.\""]
["01:18,100","01:18,800","\"That's true.\""]

["01:27,800","01:31,040","\"When I counted the fact that he have one wing.\""]
["01:31,040","01:34,200","\"Oh, I see it's one wing at Angel again.\""]
["01:34,200","01:35,880","\"He's got the one wing.\""]
["01:35,880","01:39,040","\"He is an angle to rule them all.\""]
["01:39,040","01:40,040","\"Remember?\""]
["01:40,040","01:41,480","\"One wing to rule them all.\""]
["01:41,480","01:43,440","\"Is he also made out of gradients?\""]
["01:43,440","01:45,240","\"I wish.\""]
["01:45,240","01:49,440","\"What do you think of his dumb ass fucking bat costume?\""]

["01:53,440","01:56,680","\"We didn't get far enough in, uh, in fufuza.\""]
["01:56,680","02:01,800","\"Okay, all you got to do is replace the the bat wing shape with a line\""]
["02:01,800","02:08,680","\"A horizontal line. Yeah, he had lines coming out in the view remember\""]
["02:08,680","02:11,480","\"You and many vectors come out watch out\""]
["02:11,480","02:19,160","\"Julian no remember when he teleports away. He's probably gonna do the thing where he goes to do the big big\""]

["02:43,920","02:48,980","\"Well at least it shows that he's a difficult\""]
["02:53,600","03:00,500","\"Porky Pig. I was just about to say how ridiculous it would be if there were Looney Tunes characters in this and then I remember\""]

["03:03,820","03:10,960","\"So if it was if he has a tragic death in Kingdom Hearts - if it was a if it was like\""]
["03:10,960","03:13,840","\"Daffy Duck and Porky Pig it wouldn't be all that different\""]
["03:13,840","03:16,480","\"They probably work better than this\""]

["03:38,240","03:40,760","\"Why should we had enough time in the year to get a mark?\""]
["03:45,920","03:49,040","\"When the guy turns around and he spreads his arms and he looks real happy.\""]
["03:49,040","03:52,320","\"Isn't that what Sora says after he thinks that Goofy's dad is?\""]
["03:52,320","03:53,600","\"Not like this.\""]
["03:53,600","03:54,960","\"Something like that, I don't remember.\""]

["04:41,280","04:46,880","\"Nothing can stop him. He's so happy. He's the equivalent of dangling keys in front of a camera hoping people will pay money\""]
["04:46,880","04:53,080","\"He's also like the perfect friend. He's got a six pack. He's always smiling and dancing\""]
["04:53,080","04:55,560","\"He'll protect you\""]

["04:57,720","05:02,960","\"He's a summon in Kingdom Hearts - you get the Freddy Freaker shield. There's a bunch of him spinning around\""]
["05:02,960","05:08,920","\"I could picture that too. What if you combine Freddy Freaker with big baby Bob?\""]
["05:10,160","05:12,160","\"What would happen Chris?\""]
