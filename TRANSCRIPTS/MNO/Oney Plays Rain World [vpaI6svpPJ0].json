["00:17,960","00:24,400","\"where things are trying to eat you, and you can eat little dragonflies and shit, and the more you eat,\""]
["00:24,400","00:29,600","\"You can like evolve and like gain new abilities or something like that.\""]

["00:42,920","00:45,760","\"Yeah, I would go for the survivor, the normal mode.\""]
["00:45,760","00:50,480","\"I want to play a fun game right now.\""]
["00:50,480","00:54,160","\"But yeah, they're good at creating tension, like when you're being hunted.\""]
["00:54,160","00:56,160","\"Okay.\""]
["00:56,160","01:00,160","\"Wow.\""]

["01:26,040","01:30,600","\"They do look like fucking marshmallows. Maybe they impale each other and then like what is it doing?\""]
["01:30,600","01:35,640","\"Oh, they're fucking with moths. Yeah, that's what we want to do. It's a little bat moth thing.\""]
["01:35,640","01:39,320","\"Yeah, they're so cute. Yeah, that's what they eat like little bug\""]
["01:39,320","01:43,800","\"things. So is this whole game about eating moths? Yes.\""]
["01:43,800","01:50,520","\"Okay, I mean, I have definitely not played through this game. I've put in maybe like a couple hours tops.\""]
