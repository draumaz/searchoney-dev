["11:02,200","11:09,240","\"Look at that. That's fun. But um in audio there's words like it's very warm. It's very bright\""]
["11:09,240","11:14,080","\"It's very like it's stupid shit like that those those do have accepted meanings\""]
["11:14,080","11:19,260","\"No, I don't think anybody really uses them correct, but no one ever explains like you have to figure it out\""]
["11:19,260","11:25,980","\"No, I remember looking it up and I still don't 100% get it one is a little base one tends to like warmer\""]
["11:25,980","11:29,760","\"Means it usually has like more base, right? Yeah, and like yeah\""]

["11:55,980","12:02,300","\"Do you risk selling a douche bag and actually using like a word like that or do you purposely discard knowledge?\""]
["12:02,300","12:08,260","\"I'd describe it but like like purposely you don't discard it. You just don't discard because you can't guess it's hard to really\""]
["12:08,580","12:12,600","\"Like you know what it is, but I guess the word is that you deliberately ignore it\""]
["12:12,600","12:19,080","\"Do you deliberately not use it to avoid selling a douche? It all depends on the word sec. Yeah\""]
["12:19,080","12:20,900","\"Yes, act\""]

["37:29,880","37:30,880","\"It was called gun bust.\""]
["37:30,880","37:34,000","\"Why did she still 60 what happened to her?\""]
["37:34,000","37:38,820","\"She went on this mission in space to go fight these evil aliens that lived on the other\""]
["37:38,820","37:43,400","\"side of the universe so she had to travel at like light speed and I guess her going\""]
["37:43,400","37:47,940","\"at light speed made it so like time like sort of stood still for her but it still took\""]
["37:47,940","37:50,500","\"her like many many years to get there.\""]
["37:50,500","37:54,380","\"No I think this is actually like Einsteinian physics.\""]
["37:54,380","37:56,380","\"It is, that is.\""]
["37:56,380","38:01,280","\"Yeah, the closer you get the light the more time contracts.\""]
["38:01,280","38:05,760","\"for your highlights yeah good guy so if that's that's why if you say if you\""]
["38:05,760","38:11,500","\"fucking swear on a black hole like you you you put your ship around little black\""]
["38:11,500","38:17,400","\"hole you can technically actually do you know the astronauts are actually like\""]
["38:17,400","38:23,200","\"like like like four seconds younger than the rest of earth yeah it's kind of fucked\""]
["38:23,200","38:27,720","\"up I mean I think I think GPS's have to have little things it constantly\""]
["38:27,720","38:35,140","\"Correct because there's ever so slightly slower in them really yeah, cuz they're they're further away from gravity the more gravity you have\""]
["38:35,140","38:39,900","\"I mean, I've got a fucking visit. I'm not gonna go into this because I'm not even that great explain it\""]
["38:39,900","38:46,880","\"And I hardly understand it is every single like clock slightly out of sync with each like is there any clock?\""]
["38:46,880","38:52,560","\"That's exactly spawn on to another clock. I mean so I mean it comes damn close\""]
["38:52,560","38:55,800","\"So you know about how the atomic clocks work, right? No\""]
["38:56,560","39:01,840","\"Like they measure time in like the one of the most precise ways possible, which is like\""]
["39:01,840","39:05,520","\"I don't remember what kind of atom it is, but essentially it\""]
["39:05,520","39:10,240","\"It monitors the decay of an atom, which is something that happens in like a perfect\""]
["39:10,240","39:12,720","\"Consistent way.\""]
["39:12,720","39:14,080","\"Consistent interval.\""]
["39:14,080","39:15,120","\"Yeah\""]
["39:15,120","39:22,560","\"And so it's accurate up to like some tiny like like fraction or fraction of a fraction of a microsecond\""]
["39:24,560","39:28,940","\"Good. I can see why people don't talk about Sonic 1 in a good light.\""]
["39:28,940","39:30,760","\"This game fucking sucks.\""]
["39:30,760","39:32,800","\"Why don't people talk about Sonic 1 in a good light?\""]
["39:32,800","39:35,280","\"'Cause it's fucking designed like shit, none of this is fun.\""]
["39:35,280","39:39,000","\"I would say Sonic 2 definitely improves the light on it.\""]
["39:39,000","39:41,200","\"Green Hill 1 is fun. Green Hill 1 sucks.\""]
["39:41,200","39:43,560","\"Oh, like fuck that scares the shit out of me.\""]
["39:43,560","39:45,000","\"That's actually really good.\""]
["39:45,000","39:48,240","\"That's the OG video game jumpscare.\""]

["40:31,520","40:32,840","\"- Totally.\""]
["40:32,840","40:35,000","\"- I think it's really clear that it's the result\""]

["40:38,200","40:39,560","\"- Oh, you wanna say you became a furry\""]

["40:55,280","40:56,800","\"- That's his start to ascend though of that.\""]
["40:56,800","40:58,600","\"- I wanted to fuck Made Marion from Robin Hood\""]

["41:01,120","41:02,920","\"- We had a gadget for rescue rangers.\""]
["41:02,920","41:05,360","\"I would literally as a five year old boy.\""]

["41:06,200","41:07,040","\"- Yeah, he's sexy.\""]
["41:07,040","41:09,600","\"- Yeah, you said that.\""]

["41:12,600","41:13,440","\"Not gadget boy.\""]
["41:13,440","41:14,280","\"- You said gadget boy.\""]
["41:14,280","41:15,120","\"- Gadget boy and mother.\""]
["41:15,120","41:16,080","\"- I'm trying to even think of like\""]
["41:16,080","41:17,560","\"how two characters always look.\""]
["41:17,560","41:18,960","\"I'm not even just saying this to a lot.\""]
["41:18,960","41:28,440","\"Building what if Mike Matei had been interviewing or have been doing a review with gadget boy instead of inspector gadget that would be as funny\""]

["41:30,440","41:34,400","\"Maybe but you just just let it if you did that video just come from him\""]
["41:34,400","41:39,360","\"Doing that impression in a different video and I think he was so good that he made his own video about it\""]
["41:39,360","41:40,360","\"No, you know what I think it was\""]
["41:40,360","41:46,160","\"I actually genuinely do think he was trying to be funny for April fools and put up a video that's completely stupid\""]
["41:46,160","41:48,160","\"I don't know, there's no way that's self-aware.\""]
["41:48,160","41:50,660","\"I think it might be a little bit, I'm not sure.\""]
["41:50,660","41:52,160","\"No, I-well, I wrote what happened.\""]
["41:52,160","41:53,160","\"It doesn't read that way to me.\""]
["41:53,160","41:55,660","\"I know it doesn't read that way at all, that's why it's so funny.\""]
["41:55,660","41:58,160","\"I'll tell you why I think that that's what happened, because there is-\""]
["41:58,160","42:01,160","\"there is proof that there's like a video that came like two weeks before that video came out.\""]
["42:01,160","42:05,160","\"No, yeah, it was him reviewing the Mario DVD menu.\""]
["42:05,160","42:10,160","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so he obviously did it there, it was like, oh, that's really funny, I get really good at that.\""]
["42:10,160","42:12,160","\"I'm not sure if that's why though, maybe-\""]
["42:12,160","42:14,060","\"like play devil's ad.\""]
["42:14,060","42:15,060","\"Play devil's ad.\""]
["42:15,060","42:18,460","\"Maybe just maybe like they thought it was ironically funny\""]
["42:18,460","42:20,060","\"and it became like a joke maybe.\""]
["42:20,060","42:20,900","\"- Elmo of Grouchoa though.\""]
["42:20,900","42:21,740","\"There's too much evidence.\""]
["42:21,740","42:25,060","\"- Elmo of Grouchoa and you can't write off.\""]
["42:25,060","42:26,300","\"- No, you can't write that off.\""]
["42:26,300","42:40,220","\"That's un-\""]
["42:40,220","42:44,300","\"Like back to back pretty much with that Elmo graduate video like really close together I think yeah\""]
["42:44,300","42:48,920","\"So that was all during the period where like I think yeah\""]
["42:48,920","42:54,120","\"He was like how is watching James that he was like James is big James working on his movie and he's just like\""]
["42:54,120","42:57,880","\"Yeah, I think I think he got a little maybe got a little power hungry. I don't know\""]
["42:57,880","43:04,360","\"I don't think I like I agree. It's it sucks, but maybe just maybe yeah, just maybe what?\""]
