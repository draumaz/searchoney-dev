["00:03,200","00:04,200","\"*Sigh*\""]
["00:04,200","00:05,300","\"With friends.\""]
["00:05,300","00:05,800","\"Yes.\""]
["00:05,800","00:06,800","\"She's busty.\""]
["00:06,800","00:07,500","\"Yes.\""]
["00:07,500","00:09,000","\"She's got a sweet outfit.\""]
["00:09,000","00:11,000","\"Risky boots.\""]
["00:11,000","00:13,000","\"She looks like a little blue monkey, though.\""]
["00:13,000","00:14,500","\"A little blue monkey.\""]
["00:14,500","00:15,500","\"Yeah, look how wide her like...\""]
["00:15,500","00:16,600","\"She has like, go queers.\""]
["00:16,600","00:17,600","\"*Laughs*\""]
["00:17,600","00:19,200","\"Like, wider in her head.\""]
["00:19,200","00:20,800","\"I like that, though. I think it's cute.\""]
["00:20,800","00:21,600","\"'Cause she is huge...\""]
["00:21,600","00:21,900","\"Look at...\""]
["00:21,900","00:23,600","\"She is huge fucking like, monkey...\""]
["00:23,600","00:24,400","\"...elf ears.\""]
["00:24,400","00:25,100","\"Huge monkey fit.\""]
["00:25,100","00:26,000","\"Don't get cute!\""]
["00:26,000","00:29,000","\"So basically, her weapons got stolen.\""]
["00:29,000","00:30,400","\"And she's like, \"\"You have my weapons!\"\"\""]
["00:30,400","00:32,360","\"And she's like, \"\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\"\""]
["00:32,360","00:36,920","\"Because what actually happened was, they released the pirate's curse.\""]
["00:36,920","00:39,920","\"And the pirate's curse took all the weapons.\""]
["00:39,920","00:44,720","\"And she's like, \"\"My men are missing, and the men are infected with this thing.\"\"\""]
["00:44,720","00:48,160","\"Which is like the darkness or something, and you have to fight them and take them out of it.\""]
["00:48,160","00:51,520","\"So you have to collect about eight of them in each level.\""]
["00:51,520","00:55,960","\"I know where most of them are, but you don't need most of them, you only need a few.\""]
["00:55,960","00:58,160","\"Yeah, we're glad for about how they did the backgrounds.\""]
["00:58,160","00:58,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:58,660","01:01,860","\"It looks like they drew them high res and then shrunk them down.\""]
["01:01,860","01:03,160","\"I think that's what they did do.\""]
["01:03,160","01:04,000","\"It looks like it.\""]
["01:04,000","01:05,160","\"Looks good though.\""]
["01:05,160","01:07,960","\"Like look at this transformation.\""]
["01:07,960","01:09,960","\"Mm hmm.\""]
["01:09,960","01:11,160","\"Scree.\""]
["01:11,160","01:12,260","\"It's a cackle bat.\""]
["01:12,260","01:12,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:12,860","01:14,060","\"See, it's like a darkness creature.\""]
["01:14,060","01:16,860","\"She knows about it because she remembers her pirate master.\""]
["01:16,860","01:18,460","\"She basically has a master.\""]
["01:18,460","01:20,460","\"And that's a lot of this story.\""]
["01:20,460","01:23,560","\"You get to fight this guy now.\""]
["01:23,560","01:25,360","\"Yeah, he's really easy though.\""]
["01:25,360","01:30,080","\"You just like does one the same move what in that purple bitch is making you do it why?\""]
["01:30,080","01:39,300","\"Because she wants Mike she wants her tinker bat back or whatever\""]
["01:39,300","01:47,120","\"Yeah, what they're called but her little fucking those explosions were fine looking and her doing that shit again\""]
["01:47,120","01:51,200","\"What are doing that look at that? This is pixelation on that lamp\""]
["01:52,720","01:57,680","\"Ridiculous I don't get why they do certain effects like why don't they just use pixels?\""]
["01:57,680","02:03,020","\"I don't know but that effect looks like something straight out of like the n64 game of fucking like Mario Party\""]
["02:03,020","02:05,020","\"Yeah, it's like so unfitting\""]
["02:05,020","02:09,660","\"Oh, yeah, the lamp. How do we use it?\""]
["02:09,660","02:15,600","\"There we go. Okay, so you got to collect the dust. I don't understand because the pixel art's so good\""]
["02:15,600","02:18,160","\"It's weird. I don't know either\""]
["02:18,280","02:22,800","\"So you have to collect all so essentially the game is you have to collect the dark magic\""]
["02:22,800","02:25,920","\"You don't need all of it. You need some of it to get to the prince and\""]
["02:25,920","02:32,400","\"It's kind of like Metroidvania where it's like roguelike and stuff. Hmm. I like that stuff\""]
["02:32,400","02:37,280","\"Sorry, I'm skipping all the dialogue. I don't metroidvane really care too much because I kind of know it\""]
["02:37,280","02:39,800","\"If you're off on the hook, so get lost\""]
["02:39,800","02:46,240","\"Pirates master guy sounds pretty dangerous dangerous. He was the greatest threat Sequin land has ever known\""]
["02:46,240","02:50,120","\"So she's talking about the pirate guy that I just add lived real quickly\""]
["02:50,120","02:58,560","\"Interesting, sorry, I think I can't get engrossed in text boxes. I feel like I'm playing a fucking RPG maker game\""]
["02:58,560","03:04,000","\"It's like I don't really give a shit. Okay. Sorry. No, okay, so\""]
["03:04,000","03:07,600","\"Now look there he is is cramped\""]
["03:07,600","03:12,600","\"It's cold clamps. I forget what's in here. Oh, yeah, it's a chick\""]
["03:13,640","03:20,000","\"Well, I can come in here later and there's gonna be an egg here. Yeah, and then that's what I need or I can I think I can talk to her\""]
["03:20,000","03:24,820","\"I'm gonna talk to her right now. No, I don't talk right now because it's what's kind of cool about this is it has like\""]
["03:24,820","03:27,560","\"Sequential stories. Mm-hmm. You can catch like\""]
["03:27,560","03:31,880","\"Glimps of different stories gimps. Yeah, I don't know I can't talk\""]
["03:31,880","03:35,960","\"This is a healthful you can come in here and refresh yourself anytime you get full health. Oh cool\""]
["03:35,960","03:41,680","\"You also go to the store and the stores are very important here is another really important thing\""]
["03:42,000","03:46,360","\"There's these things called heart squids you can turn them into her and\""]
["03:46,360","03:51,520","\"She turns them into health she puts all four of them together and smash them together and makes them a heart for you\""]
["03:51,520","03:53,880","\"Oh, and you find them in dungeons and all over the place\""]
["03:53,880","03:57,320","\"That's cool all these characters have like little hot pixel bodies\""]
["03:57,320","04:02,720","\"It's I'm gonna need to take a break into the bathroom soon. Well you gotta wash your hands\""]
["04:02,720","04:05,240","\"Wash more than that\""]
["04:05,240","04:07,240","\"so feet\""]
["04:08,080","04:15,100","\"Wait, so you want this stuff. Oh my god. It's so ugly because it upgrades your your hat attack\""]
["04:15,100","04:20,000","\"It's very important to get that they have like five people in charge of the fucking graphics\""]
["04:20,000","04:24,240","\"You look up as they attack now. Oh cool\""]
["04:24,240","04:26,920","\"so I even have like little like\""]
["04:26,920","04:32,760","\"A bit of a delay and stuff seems like some of the more important environments. They actually did pixel art\""]
["04:32,760","04:37,720","\"Okay, like see the bricks in the wall there. Yeah, it seems like they didn't put a filter on that\""]
["04:37,720","04:43,580","\"They actually did it like pixel by pixel and then in here they draw actual backgrounds. They shrink it down save time\""]
["04:43,580","04:48,080","\"Yeah, that's cool. I need to go to the library to get a library card\""]
["04:48,080","04:50,760","\"what I actually need is\""]
["04:50,760","04:55,280","\"The talk to the old man or something like that\""]
["04:55,280","04:58,160","\"Maybe I could just talk to the I think I got to talk to the owl lady\""]
["04:58,160","05:02,140","\"If not, then I have to go all the way back to my place and I think my uncle will be there and I've talked to him\""]
["05:02,140","05:04,140","\"Huh, what the fuck did I just step on?\""]
["05:05,320","05:07,840","\"Shit that was weird. I like went through it\""]
["05:07,840","05:15,800","\"Just talk to her and see if anything yeah, I think she gives me a little library card. Hmm. Yeah, we're good. What does her parrot do?\""]
["05:15,800","05:23,880","\"It's like I forget. I don't even know if it's I think it's just like there. I don't know do he squawk\""]
["05:23,880","05:27,080","\"I don't remember it actually doing anything. Okay\""]
["05:27,080","05:31,760","\"Well, this game is gay turned off. All right the part don't do nothing\""]
["05:32,320","05:36,940","\"We got the library card the Chris I'm getting some I'm sure you'll return off it's good\""]
["05:36,940","05:43,400","\"I mean the only thing I don't like is I don't like how you have to do this every single fucking time you come back here I\""]
["05:43,400","05:47,500","\"Mean you get a run later on which lets you charge through everything\""]
["05:47,500","05:50,140","\"But it's still like you have to come through here and do all this shit\""]
["05:50,140","05:52,940","\"It's like you wish you could just teleport there quickly\""]
["05:52,940","05:56,300","\"But this is like a part of the level so this is like\""]
["05:56,300","05:59,360","\"This is like enemies and shit mm-hmm\""]
["05:59,960","06:02,720","\"Inside of like a world map. It's like, you know when you go to a hub world\""]
["06:02,720","06:04,240","\"You feel like you want to be safe there?\""]
["06:04,240","06:08,640","\"You're like you don't go out of the hub world and suddenly enemies are throwing shit at you when you leave the town like\""]
["06:08,640","06:12,540","\"I'm still basically in the hub world. This is still the hub world, right?\""]
["06:12,540","06:17,120","\"So I don't know why they do this. This is like I guess it's to teach you how to attack and stuff, right?\""]
["06:17,120","06:22,320","\"But it's like you have to do this every single fucking time when you get stronger and you come back\""]
["06:22,320","06:25,900","\"You feel like more badass that you got stronger. You can blast through it quicker\""]
["06:25,900","06:30,380","\"Yeah, essentially, but it's still like really annoying to begin with because like okay\""]
["06:30,380","06:31,380","\"I'm gonna come through here, right?\""]
["06:31,380","06:34,220","\"And then I have to come through here again after I come through here already\""]
["06:34,220","06:37,860","\"I mean if they mixed it up with the enemies it wouldn't be so bad. Yeah, there's a lot of this\""]
["06:37,860","06:43,000","\"One that one I don't think anything yet. I\""]
["06:43,000","06:45,780","\"Can't get that cuz I need the hat\""]
["06:45,780","06:48,500","\"What kind of hat we talk there's a safe guy?\""]
["06:48,500","06:53,500","\"Where do you go? There you go. So that's what I mean where it's like I'm still basically in town\""]
["06:53,500","06:56,840","\"But now I'm going to like fucking library or something. Okay\""]
["06:56,840","07:00,100","\"Before so yeah, I feel the force -\""]
["07:00,100","07:08,100","\"Jesus I love how they fucking explode\""]
["07:08,100","07:14,580","\"The bento box are like full health. They're so fucking important. Why did that guy explode like that? No one else did\""]
["07:14,580","07:17,380","\"I don't know. It's a good question. You part of some kind of\""]
["07:17,380","07:22,500","\"The music in this game is also really fucking good. Yeah, really cool so\""]
["07:22,500","07:25,500","\"What about the boxes dude?\""]
["07:25,500","07:27,500","\"It's like full health.\""]
["07:27,500","07:30,500","\"You get more hearts because I'm going to kill the squids.\""]
["07:30,500","07:31,500","\"Oh, okay.\""]
["07:31,500","07:35,500","\"But they want you to beat the game without killing any squid thing.\""]
["07:35,500","07:41,500","\"And that's essentially, I think four hearts total is all you get for the entire game.\""]
["07:41,500","07:43,500","\"And it's really fucking hard.\""]
["07:43,500","07:44,500","\"Oh, really?\""]
["07:44,500","07:45,500","\"Squid up there.\""]
["07:45,500","07:47,500","\"So do you get like half hearts or what?\""]
["07:47,500","07:48,500","\"You get like a full heart.\""]
["07:48,500","07:51,500","\"If you turn a certain amount of, I think you turn four squids, you get one heart.\""]
["07:51,500","07:58,540","\"one heart oh and then I think it's like yeah it's like 24 oh it's total so you\""]
["07:58,540","08:06,220","\"get an extra four you get like six yeah okay cool this nonsense see I'm I'm\""]
["08:06,220","08:12,860","\"here and then I I'm still in town and so they're telling me I need to get like\""]
["08:12,860","08:16,540","\"this is a new town Cory I gotta get freezy pops he's like oh it fell down\""]
["08:16,540","08:25,500","\"the sewer. You gonna go down there? Yeah. Is this fucker? Hey! Oh, don't mind me!\""]
["08:25,500","08:32,420","\"That's bird. You must see some exciting things in your travels. I need to go down\""]
["08:32,420","08:41,820","\"in the sewer. What's down there? Adventure? Yeah, essentially. Whoa! I'll talk to this guy and\""]
["08:41,820","08:42,820","\"and it'll fuck off.\""]
["08:42,820","08:46,300","\"This is like a guy you fight.\""]
["08:46,300","08:48,620","\"In the other game you fought him constantly.\""]
["08:48,620","08:49,620","\"Why do you fight him?\""]
["08:49,620","08:52,140","\"He's like one of those mini bosses who never leaves.\""]
["08:52,140","08:54,340","\"You just keep fighting different variations of him.\""]
["08:54,340","08:56,660","\"What did he look like a fool?\""]
["08:56,660","08:59,060","\"He's like, \"\"I'm tired of being a squid.\"\"\""]
["08:59,060","09:00,460","\"It's like, \"\"Oh, sorry.\"\"\""]
["09:00,460","09:04,900","\"This is the cards you got dealt my friend.\""]
["09:04,900","09:09,420","\"There's a secret in this level.\""]
["09:09,420","09:11,300","\"I can't get to it because I need to be able to charge.\""]
["09:11,300","09:15,580","\"But if you can go in there, there's like a secret area where you can play old shuntay\""]
["09:15,580","09:18,580","\"style level and you get some stuff for it.\""]
["09:18,580","09:20,580","\"What was the first shuntay?\""]
["09:20,580","09:22,740","\"Um, it was where you turn into animals.\""]
["09:22,740","09:24,500","\"It was for Game Boy?\""]
["09:24,500","09:25,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:25,500","09:26,500","\"That was it.\""]
["09:26,500","09:29,700","\"So I got to get flesh pops.\""]
["09:29,700","09:31,420","\"Oh, that's how I knew.\""]
["09:31,420","09:33,660","\"Some Kami Johnny was talking about it.\""]
["09:33,660","09:35,300","\"Yeah, he said this was his favorite one.\""]
["09:35,300","09:36,300","\"Oh, really?\""]
["09:36,300","09:38,740","\"Which I can agree, this is probably one of the best shuntays easily.\""]
["09:38,740","09:43,220","\"The other ones take too long like you're doing your little dance and you take like 40 years to turn into a monkey\""]
["09:43,220","09:49,800","\"Jeliannoy love his videos for background noise. Yeah, it's really pretty much what I use YouTube videos is\""]
["09:49,800","09:55,080","\"Specifically for background always me too. I think I have enough fleshy pop\""]
["09:55,080","10:05,060","\"Whoa you got another one yeah, I wanna have a health thing soon. I think I have three\""]
["10:07,660","10:10,860","\"Gotta kill that little snake shit\""]
["10:10,860","10:15,060","\"Haha, look at him go\""]
["10:15,060","10:21,900","\"I always study at hands because of the way the graphic thing is it was like this little bit of green that makes it look\""]
["10:21,900","10:23,900","\"Like he has these little hands\""]
["10:23,900","10:25,500","\"He's a bit of a cutie\""]
["10:25,500","10:33,020","\"What's that? Oh, yeah, I need a I get her shoot thing and it opens the eye which lets me get the chest\""]
["10:33,020","10:36,420","\"That's an eyeball. Oh, that's the chest. Yeah, I can't get the chest yet\""]
["10:37,140","10:40,540","\"It's a secret in a quicker way to get there. I\""]
["10:40,540","10:44,100","\"Have to take the old route. I can't go quicker\""]
["10:44,100","10:49,300","\"So I have to come up here instead, but I have fleshy pops think I have enough. What do they do?\""]
["10:49,300","10:53,620","\"He's gonna give me like some access thing so I can go inside and\""]
["10:53,620","10:59,340","\"That's what pretty much starts the quest. I got the royal key. See that's what I needed so I can go into the library now\""]
["10:59,340","11:02,500","\"I won't be bothered. I don't know if I should know with this guy\""]
["11:02,500","11:06,460","\"Yeah, he wants to get me his vacation brochure, okay\""]
["11:06,460","11:11,060","\"Yeah, Astro Boy came out on the Game Boy Advance and it was like a really good game\""]
["11:11,060","11:13,940","\"and it came out on the PS2 and it was like really bad games.\""]
["11:13,940","11:16,380","\"So nobody played the Game Boy Advance version really.\""]
["11:16,380","11:18,540","\"Do you remember the fucking Astro Boy?\""]
["11:18,540","11:22,420","\"Was it the Astro Boy movie that had Nicholas Cage as his dad?\""]
["11:22,420","11:24,220","\"That was around the time the game came out I think.\""]
["11:24,220","11:28,220","\"Oh my god, he was such a terrible dad voice actor.\""]
["11:28,220","11:33,460","\"Like Nicholas Cage can sometimes act, but when he doesn't try, he cannot try.\""]
["11:33,460","11:39,140","\"There's this scene when he's in a room with his son and he's like, or with the boy, he's\""]
