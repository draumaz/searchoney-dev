["03:12,520","03:19,720","\"Mundus is merged with his physical body.\""]
["03:19,720","03:21,720","\"Mundus is merged with the mighty Morphon\""]
["03:21,720","03:28,740","\"The street is mine. We kill Mundus if we kill the Mundus within we kill the Mundus on the outside, too\""]
["03:28,740","03:32,820","\"I do like those little particles fall on them around. That's pretty cool. I\""]

["03:48,100","03:49,880","\"Thanks\""]
["03:49,880","03:52,440","\"Thanks for reminding me I had to do that sometimes\""]
["03:52,440","03:59,480","\"Why do you aim for above the floor you are on?\""]
["03:59,480","04:05,480","\"Not everyone understands structures and systems like you\""]

["04:22,040","04:24,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:24,040","04:28,040","\"Why is it that when a thing gets big it has to move slow?\""]
["04:28,040","04:30,040","\"I never got that.\""]
["04:30,040","04:32,040","\"Yeah, you'd think that it's increased mass would mean\""]
["04:32,040","04:37,040","\"also way bigger muscles and therefore it would move at least the same rate,\""]
["04:37,040","04:42,380","\"But because it's bigger it would appear actually a lot faster wrong. You're just so wrong\""]
["04:42,380","04:44,740","\"It's actually embarrassing how wrong you are\""]
["04:44,740","04:47,520","\"I know I said it\""]
["04:47,520","04:48,620","\"I know I brought it up\""]
["04:48,620","04:53,300","\"But that was just to bait you into saying something so foolish because I knew you do it you do every time\""]

["04:56,860","04:59,700","\"You got pwned\""]
["05:03,340","05:08,620","\"Oh, I can do this now just in case you wanted to see me do that. You're gonna die. I know\""]
["05:08,620","05:11,180","\"And you can't activate devil trigger either\""]
["05:11,180","05:17,900","\"I'm pretty sure that this this fight has like some phases to it like once I get some shit to places or maybe I'm just gonna\""]
["05:17,900","05:23,580","\"Lose but you know what it's not about the fight. It's not about winning. It's about having a good time\""]
["05:23,580","05:29,820","\"Are you smiling Chris? It's the journey we had we got here with yeah, it's a fuck\""]
["05:30,780","05:36,360","\"Why did I have to be that way it's not about the journey it's about how much you learn me\""]
["05:36,360","05:46,820","\"Well you like silly silly stuff\""]
["05:46,820","05:53,140","\"Made you laugh it did\""]
["05:53,140","05:58,760","\"What the journey learn anything yeah, they should put that in a film honestly\""]
["05:59,740","06:01,740","\"That's like the big lesson at the other\""]
["06:01,740","06:06,420","\"We snapper about the journey\""]
["06:06,420","06:09,020","\"It was about what we learn\""]
["06:09,020","06:11,780","\"They should recut citizen Cain\""]
["06:11,780","06:18,780","\"I also like the accent they didn't need some foreign guy to say it\""]
["06:18,780","06:22,980","\"What I don't know what that accent is I'm not sure if I made that up or not\""]
["06:25,180","06:29,740","\"That's like a weird accent that it's it's like almost like Baltic or Russian or something\""]
["06:29,740","06:34,100","\"But it's almost like people do that accent when they just want to do a shitty accent\""]
["06:34,100","06:40,980","\"I have like a soft spot for just like zero consistency stupid accent. I guess that's kind of a gold member accent\""]
["06:40,980","06:43,420","\"Yeah, a little Lizbully's like fake\""]
["06:43,420","06:46,980","\"That thing\""]
["06:46,980","06:52,980","\"Yeah, I'm supposed to be jumping over those shock waves and I'm just absolutely not doing that Mundus\""]
["06:53,500","06:54,500","\"Beyond this.\""]
["06:54,500","06:56,940","\"- Mundus makes me a little bit comfy on this sometimes.\""]
["06:56,940","06:59,620","\"- I dare you to defeat this massive boss creature.\""]

["07:04,780","07:08,380","\"He gives him incisement, size and glowing red orbs.\""]
["07:08,380","07:11,220","\"- There's something about shells where he says something\""]
["07:11,220","07:14,140","\"that just makes you go, how did you even come up with that?\""]
["07:14,140","07:16,940","\"Like, he says weird words.\""]
["07:16,940","07:20,500","\"I'm just saying he talks silly.\""]
["07:20,500","07:25,060","\"No, no, he says weird things like no other human can possibly come up with look at this powerful\""]
["07:25,060","07:29,600","\"I think I can maybe come up with it if I really wanted to think of an example\""]
["07:29,600","07:31,540","\"But I can't remember any because they're so weird\""]
["07:31,540","07:40,220","\"You mean like when he just like assumes weird things. Yeah, that are just really weird conclusions to jump to yeah, I love that\""]

["18:47,640","18:50,640","\"Oh your hair turned and you know that Lee white and whoa\""]
["18:50,640","18:57,640","\"And it's not a good thing to tolerate Stockholm syndrome and enable it. Yeah like Dante just a rock and thrower\""]
