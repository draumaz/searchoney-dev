["00:07,360","00:08,800","\"\"\"Oh, look at me!\"\"\""]
["00:08,800","00:10,600","\"\"\"Oh, look at that guy, he's cool.\"\"\""]
["00:10,600","00:12,600","\"\"\"I'm so thin there.\"\"\""]
["00:12,600","00:14,200","\"\"\"What's the kind of zed?\"\"\""]
["00:14,200","00:17,240","\"\"\"Is there like worms or twigs or something?\"\"\""]
["00:17,240","00:18,800","\"\"\"He's like the corpse burner.\"\"\""]
["00:18,800","00:22,000","\"\"\"He actually comes back later and it's like, how did he get up there?\"\"\""]
["00:22,000","00:26,000","\"\"\"Ooh, he's some kind of like mythical figure, but I don't think that he ever...\"\"\""]
["00:26,560","00:31,840","\"Either you kill him and it's very unceremonious or they never really explain what his deal is.\""]
["00:31,840","00:38,360","\"But Kratos is always uh, he always has enough respect to not stab the guy, so I don't know what's up.\""]
["00:38,360","00:39,600","\"That's cool.\""]
["00:39,600","00:40,720","\"He's missing an eyeball.\""]
["00:40,720","00:42,640","\"Yeah, I mean clearly he's not here to help.\""]
["00:42,640","00:51,760","\"I don't remember if he actually like comes to any sort of a head in this game or if they just forgot about him, but I don't remember him being in the next one.\""]
["00:52,080","00:53,320","\"I could be completely wrong.\""]
["00:53,320","00:55,240","\"It could be like a major character in the next one.\""]
["00:55,240","00:56,880","\"And there's somebody screaming at the computer\""]
["00:56,880","00:58,720","\"screaming about how big of an idiot I am.\""]
["00:58,720","01:00,800","\"That floor there looks really good.\""]
["01:00,800","01:02,600","\"It reflects you.\""]
["01:02,600","01:05,840","\"I'll bet, no, I could, I swear to God,\""]
["01:05,840","01:08,360","\"there's like a point in maybe not this one,\""]
["01:08,360","01:10,720","\"but possibly the next one where there's like,\""]
["01:10,720","01:13,280","\"you have to use like the reflection from the floor\""]
["01:13,280","01:14,800","\"to look at the ceiling.\""]
["01:14,800","01:15,640","\"That's cool.\""]
["01:15,640","01:20,640","\"And I think there's also a boss that's like invisible\""]
["01:21,080","01:26,080","\"and you need to see how he splashes around on the water to track him.\""]
["01:26,080","01:29,080","\"Then you punch him in the dick.\""]
["01:29,080","01:32,440","\"Is this just gonna throw these at me?\""]
["01:32,440","01:35,080","\"Or am I supposed to be going somewhere?\""]
["01:35,080","01:38,560","\"I think that this is an infinitely spawning room of hazard enemies\""]
["01:38,560","01:44,040","\"and the actual harpies are the journey along the way.\""]
["01:44,040","01:46,200","\"But I am getting red orbs from these guys,\""]
["01:46,200","01:49,600","\"so I assume if you really wanted to just be overpowered by the end of the game,\""]
["01:49,600","01:50,680","\"You could stay in that room.\""]
["01:50,680","01:51,680","\"- You could farm them.\""]
["01:51,680","01:52,520","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:52,520","01:54,400","\"- I guess you gotta attack,\""]
["01:54,400","01:55,560","\"or they're just gonna keep fucking with you.\""]
["01:55,560","01:56,840","\"- Oh, whoa, whoa.\""]
["01:56,840","01:57,660","\"- Nice.\""]
["01:57,660","01:58,500","\"(laughing)\""]
["01:58,500","01:59,660","\"- Nice recovery.\""]
["01:59,660","02:02,320","\"- I feel like I'm supposed to block this off somehow,\""]
["02:02,320","02:06,200","\"or possibly, is there something I can like slide or move?\""]
["02:06,200","02:07,040","\"Here it is.\""]
["02:07,040","02:08,320","\"- I could have brought my juharp here,\""]
["02:08,320","02:09,160","\"and I forgot to.\""]
["02:09,160","02:10,480","\"- You have a juharp?\""]
["02:10,480","02:11,320","\"- Yeah, juharp.\""]
["02:11,320","02:12,160","\"- That's true.\""]
["02:12,160","02:13,760","\"- Actually called a juharp, is that the important?\""]
["02:13,760","02:14,600","\"- Yeah, no, it's real.\""]
["02:14,600","02:17,840","\"- No, it's called juharp on most like official things now,\""]
["02:17,840","02:20,940","\"'Cause I think the term \"\"Juharp\"\" is considered \"\"f*cked\"\"\""]
["02:20,940","02:23,780","\"because it has nothing to do with \"\"Joo's\"\"\""]
["02:23,780","02:26,220","\"and I don't know where that name ever even came from.\""]
["02:26,220","02:28,020","\"- There's those little things that go \"\"boing bing yang\"\"\""]
["02:28,020","02:29,220","\"\"\"boing bing yang\"\"\""]
["02:29,220","02:31,260","\"- Yeah, they look like this.\""]
["02:31,260","02:35,100","\"- Oh, so you conveniently got a Juharp and you are a Joo\""]
["02:35,100","02:38,180","\"but you didn't like that those things\""]
["02:38,180","02:40,420","\"are completely unrelated?\""]
["02:40,420","02:41,260","\"- Yes.\""]
["02:41,260","02:42,580","\"- Okay.\""]
["02:42,580","02:44,060","\"- No, a Jooarp is what you hear\""]
["02:44,060","02:47,220","\"when people do like the friggin' bio music\""]
["02:47,220","02:49,500","\"And there's like, no, I mean, I don't like,\""]
["02:49,500","02:52,100","\"like you got like one guy playing like a banjo.\""]
["02:52,100","02:53,060","\"And there's just like that,\""]
["02:53,060","02:55,820","\"one, one, one, one, one, like we should start a bad dude.\""]
["02:55,820","02:57,260","\"You can play the Juvar.\""]
["02:57,260","02:58,900","\"- I'd be happy to.\""]
["02:58,900","03:01,100","\"You could play the washboard.\""]
["03:01,100","03:02,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:02,100","03:04,860","\"- I'll be the, I'll be the rain stick boy.\""]
["03:04,860","03:08,500","\"- All right, we just needed to do a duist and we're set.\""]
["03:08,500","03:09,940","\"- Yo man, this game's cool and all,\""]
["03:09,940","03:12,420","\"but where's all the chicks at man?\""]
["03:12,420","03:13,940","\"- They're called chicks.\""]
["03:13,940","03:15,860","\"- Who's more chasing one right now I think.\""]
["03:15,860","03:17,860","\"I'm married off by bird people\""]
["03:17,860","03:23,980","\"Yeah, man, I was gonna get laid and then she got fucking carried off by bird people dude\""]
["03:23,980","03:26,840","\"I didn't blow it she didn't see my\""]
["03:26,840","03:32,300","\"My little ween and go that's not a big enough mean for me to put my machine\""]
["03:32,300","03:37,600","\"You're ween so big it tickles my spleen and said I'm a gene. Oh\""]
["03:37,600","03:42,260","\"I've filtered the waste out of that ween. I'm gone to gang green\""]
["03:43,220","03:45,220","\"Got the gang green and mama Jean\""]
["03:45,220","03:48,140","\"All due to my\""]
["03:48,140","03:53,380","\"Scraping around like a dental pick in my spleen I poured mr. Clean and my vajeen\""]
["03:53,380","03:56,380","\"Gang green\""]
["03:56,380","03:59,860","\"Call me the gang green queen\""]
["03:59,860","04:07,820","\"I can't contribute to this one. This is a hallway full of boys. I'll tell you what you don't go it Lyle. Thanks\""]
["04:07,820","04:09,400","\"Look at\""]
["04:09,400","04:16,200","\"Whoa look at that big lady. Yeah, she's ready for dinner. Huh? She's gonna eat up that regular size lady\""]
["04:16,200","04:20,120","\"Wasn't she already dangling on that rope like when we\""]
["04:20,120","04:23,680","\"We clearly saw you already\""]
["04:23,680","04:32,320","\"Maybe the draw distance originally was just fucking too bad to see that or in like the first game\""]
["04:32,320","04:35,120","\"It's probably two pixel or something. You gotta you got a saver\""]
["04:35,120","04:39,240","\"Was there anything behind that statue you should go check really quick?\""]
["04:39,240","04:45,640","\"Yeah, no, no, there's a wall you made me look a fool good job. Tell mark\""]
["04:45,640","04:50,080","\"You tricked me again\""]
["04:50,080","04:59,440","\"Come on plug it yeah, you can plug it up that looks like a place I should put this\""]
["04:59,440","05:07,080","\"Or something that's significant later that I just covered up like an idiot push it off the water\""]
["05:08,120","05:13,600","\"Yeah, you know yelling at me is not gonna make me go any faster push it off the edge\""]
["05:13,600","05:18,980","\"I'm supposed to put it here, and then I'm supposed to push the other one on top. Oh really I think so\""]
["05:18,980","05:25,020","\"Oh, yeah, that makes sense gonna break it you make a you make a fat stack. Yeah, that's pretty epic\""]
["05:25,020","05:27,920","\"It's kind of a\""]
["05:27,920","05:29,920","\"It's kind of a guess\""]
["05:33,360","05:39,620","\"I always like hated that that sort of like oh if you charge up this like long-winded kick\""]
["05:39,620","05:45,160","\"It'll go farther faster, but you've got you have to wait an hour for it to charge anyway\""]
["05:45,160","05:50,420","\"Okay, god damn it pull it. No, I think what I'm supposed to do is I'm supposed to go down here\""]
["05:50,420","05:56,360","\"Yeah, and get that under her right yeah, that would make sense and then she could safely drop onto it\""]
["05:56,360","05:59,200","\"I should put like a little like dribble for her clons or something\""]
["05:59,200","06:01,600","\"Rose\""]

["06:03,840","06:08,360","\"Well, I don't know like there's no shadow for her\""]
["06:08,360","06:11,760","\"So we need like some indicator of like where I actually have to put these things\""]
["06:11,760","06:16,680","\"Why did you mention her clung though cuz I mean it could be anything dripping\""]
["06:16,680","06:20,680","\"Okay\""]

["06:39,800","06:44,460","\"She's not like a character that matters. I just supposed to use this to stop something or what?\""]
["06:44,460","06:48,800","\"What's going on with that? It's just fully your heart. I need that\""]
["06:48,800","06:53,500","\"There's I was solving a puzzle maybe before I even saw the puzzle. Oh\""]
["06:53,500","06:56,520","\"No, I know\""]
["06:56,520","06:59,720","\"And you Athens crumble as you waste time!\""]
["06:59,720","07:02,280","\"Oh, Athens crumbles as I waste time.\""]
["07:02,280","07:05,080","\"Are you sure your arms just aren't getting tired?\""]
["07:05,080","07:08,240","\"You sure maybe that's not a little more the speed of the issue?\""]
["07:08,240","07:10,040","\"There you go, while you solved it.\""]
["07:10,040","07:11,480","\"[chuckles]\""]
["07:11,480","07:12,320","\"You did it.\""]
["07:12,320","07:16,000","\"I didn't even have to mention her clung.\""]

["07:41,320","07:48,580","\"She's starting to give you the same vibes as all those guys you deliberately killed right\""]
["07:48,580","07:55,660","\"Why doesn't she swing on to that big plate she's right next to cuz then the fucking\""]
["07:55,660","08:00,080","\"Athena will eat her there's exactly 66 seconds of life left in her\""]
["08:00,080","08:10,000","\"I know that it's gonna send me back to a checkpoint, but I kind of want to see her plummet to her death. I mean we all do but\""]
["08:10,000","08:13,620","\"We ain't got time for that\""]
["08:13,620","08:20,780","\"I am Kratos ghost of Sparta, and I don't got time for that shit\""]
["08:20,780","08:25,300","\"Well boy howdy we're just wait a cotton pickin minute\""]

["08:31,300","08:35,280","\"How come people don't get offended over the cotton pick-and-minute thing?\""]
["08:35,280","08:42,000","\"It seems like people have to pick cotton slaves or otherwise. It's not as if the concept to pick a cotton\""]
["08:42,000","08:47,940","\"Like but it's more prominent in our culture. I mean that's that's fair to vox thoughts of slavery\""]
["08:47,940","08:49,940","\"You can't get around that\""]
["08:49,940","08:52,020","\"But I'm gonna do this\""]
