["02:49,140","02:50,500","\"- Like I'm little critic.\""]
["02:50,500","02:52,460","\"- Do you think he'll do that if he has a child?\""]
["02:52,460","02:53,300","\"He's gonna dress them up.\""]
["02:53,300","02:54,780","\"- Oh, you're my son.\""]
["02:54,780","02:58,980","\"Hello, you're the first thing he says to his kid. I'll remember you always\""]
["02:58,980","03:03,260","\"I saw it acting like it's his boy\""]
["03:03,260","03:06,140","\"Because his kingdom hearts. It's true\""]
["03:06,140","03:09,300","\"He's ten you would do the same thing Chris\""]
["03:09,300","03:16,060","\"You see I'm gonna smack you. Let's create a fight. I could kill Freddy Fazbear in a second buzzword\""]
["03:16,060","03:19,180","\"He's got man-tism\""]
["03:19,180","03:21,860","\"Man-tism like he's a man-tiss. Yeah\""]
["03:22,700","03:27,760","\"Yeah, that's better. I love their particle effects. They still hold up\""]
["03:27,760","03:33,940","\"How do they do that Chris a lot about it visually holds up? I still really like the designs of the heartless\""]
["03:33,940","03:38,800","\"Their swords have little spooky faces on them\""]
["03:38,800","03:42,940","\"You don't like that art style Julian. I think he does\""]
["03:42,940","03:49,900","\"Birds really well Ward Kimball does really fun looking birds. I'm fine with him whenever he does anything that isn't\""]
["03:50,340","03:53,900","\"Humans I just hate the way that he makes humans look we did the Jimmy\""]
["03:53,900","03:59,600","\"He also he kept you can see it in something like Alice in Wonderland where all the eyeballs are perfectly round\""]
["03:59,600","04:02,020","\"And I don't like that sort of thing\""]
["04:02,020","04:07,620","\"So we're looks very stressed out right now. It's about to die and he's smiling softly\""]
["04:07,620","04:10,500","\"So no\""]
["04:10,500","04:13,340","\"He's ending it all. Yes for me, please\""]
["04:13,340","04:16,220","\"Do you think Sora wanted to get eaten\""]
["04:17,660","04:22,900","\"Well, I don't in in Kingdom Hearts 2. I remember every cutscene having\""]
["04:22,900","04:28,700","\"Music I don't remember there being any silent ones so they probably like\""]
["04:28,700","04:33,120","\"Like they probably took that as a lesson from the silent moments\""]
["04:33,120","04:36,780","\"I actually prefer it when like stuff doesn't have music a lot of the time\""]
["04:36,780","04:41,860","\"But for that one specific thing yeah, cuz it's supposed to be an emotional moment\""]
["04:41,860","04:45,180","\"We've been watching a lot of movies lately that I always feel that way\""]
["04:45,380","04:52,380","\"They don't need a soundtrack accompanying. There's a lot of movies are my own soundtracks. Yeah, I love the soundtrack in the old it\""]
["04:52,380","04:57,740","\"I think it's really yeah, I kind of do too a new it has kind of too much music moments\""]
["04:57,740","04:59,820","\"But I actually do like the music in the new head as well\""]
["04:59,820","05:05,000","\"We still have not seen I'm sure we will soon we probably will because it's Halloween\""]
["05:05,000","05:08,180","\"We want to hang out with friends and do yeah, we probably will end up seeing it\""]
["05:08,180","05:13,100","\"I really like it. I think it's one of my favorite films everything when I say it's Halloween\""]
["05:13,100","05:17,660","\"We have not started recording bony plays yet, so yeah, I don't know when this is gonna go up\""]
["05:17,660","05:21,300","\"Well, I was gonna say though is watching the original it\""]
["05:21,300","05:27,820","\"Just cemented that yes everything I like about it is how goofy it is\""]
["05:27,820","05:31,820","\"I if you drop all that even if you do the narrative better\""]
["05:31,820","05:35,060","\"I don't know if I'm gonna feel like oh, you know what?\""]
["05:35,060","05:41,060","\"I actually like this a lot if you take Tim Curry out of it for me you take all the silliness out of it\""]
["05:41,060","05:45,580","\"I don't know if I'm gonna get too much from it, but I should see if people judging her\""]
["05:45,580","05:50,700","\"I'm just not that interested as all. Well, I wasn't either until I saw it. I couldn't believe how much I liked it\""]
["05:50,700","05:55,060","\"Like it got me super I would enjoy being pleasantly surprised\""]
["05:55,060","05:59,700","\"I remember I remember it started and I was like this is gonna stink cuz with first like five minutes\""]
["05:59,700","06:03,380","\"I was like this is so I mean their trailer was terrible. You know, I know right?\""]
["06:03,380","06:08,160","\"I was like this but the thing is I've gotten pretty used to trailers. Yes trailers do not\""]
["06:08,700","06:12,280","\"Trailers are all formatted the same way and just bring out the worst and everything\""]
["06:12,280","06:19,040","\"What the fuck is he doing? I can't believe I expressed if he's being right now, but oh my god fucking stabbed him\""]
["06:19,040","06:24,820","\"It got that new movie got me super duper into it within five minutes\""]
["06:24,820","06:26,420","\"and\""]
["06:26,420","06:31,460","\"It's not his goofy, but it's actually super just it's just cool. It's got like\""]
["06:31,460","06:35,820","\"Like I really like the new thing wise, but it doesn't have Tim Curry\""]
["06:35,820","06:43,180","\"I know but it has it doesn't have Tim Curry resting on his elbow. I know actually the new Pennywise is pretty funny, too\""]
["06:43,180","06:50,820","\"He has his moments. What does he do? I don't ruin it ruin it. No, no, no, no, no, no, okay?\""]
["06:50,820","06:57,180","\"I'll sell you it's a very good adventure movie and reminded me a lot of the good old-fashioned legs adventures\""]
["06:57,180","07:00,140","\"Even Spielberg kind of movie except it's hard like I'm scary\""]
["07:01,380","07:06,780","\"The characters are actually all extremely like him. I was extremely surprised by that\""]
["07:06,780","07:11,680","\"Is the one child does he still look like an old man even though he's like eight? No\""]
["07:11,680","07:17,460","\"Well, you say the one child like we could differentiate. Well remember we're watching the original it\""]
["07:17,460","07:22,420","\"I don't remember their names. That's what I'm saying. They're all interchangeable all the kids in the fucking movie were great\""]
["07:22,420","07:25,940","\"They probably stand out a lot more than the new one\""]
["07:28,420","07:31,060","\"That's what I'm saying they were interchangeable in the original.\""]
["07:31,060","07:35,020","\"What I like about the new one is they all actually act like like we would act as kids.\""]
["07:35,020","07:37,780","\"They're just a little fucking perverted ass.\""]
["07:37,780","07:41,020","\"All I remember from the original is their stutter boy.\""]
["07:41,020","07:46,540","\"There's Seth Green as wacky comedian who is the most annoying character when he becomes\""]
["07:46,540","07:47,540","\"an adult.\""]
["07:47,540","07:51,060","\"I think Finn plays him in this one and he's really good.\""]
["07:51,060","07:52,060","\"Okay.\""]
["07:52,060","07:54,060","\"Is he ever played by Seth Green now?\""]
["07:54,060","07:57,060","\"I think the next one is going to be played by Seth.\""]
["07:57,060","07:59,760","\"That's Green's playing Finn's character in the next one.\""]
["07:59,760","08:01,260","\"I'm not sure if that's true.\""]
["08:01,260","08:03,220","\"- I'm very curious how people are gonna take\""]
["08:03,220","08:04,700","\"the adult half of the story.\""]
["08:04,700","08:06,420","\"- Yeah, 'cause that's the weakest part.\""]
["08:06,420","08:08,100","\"- You know what, when I was watching this,\""]
["08:08,100","08:10,140","\"I was really surprised they cut that out of the first one.\""]
["08:10,140","08:12,140","\"I was like, they just completely removed it.\""]
["08:12,140","08:12,980","\"And that's why-- - That's fine.\""]
["08:12,980","08:14,020","\"- And that's why I liked it.\""]
["08:14,020","08:16,580","\"I was like, wow, they cut out the worst part, cool.\""]
["08:16,580","08:18,940","\"So that means that the next part's probably gonna\""]
["08:18,940","08:20,380","\"be kinda shitty.\""]
["08:20,380","08:21,220","\"- That's what I'm anticipating.\""]
["08:21,220","08:23,060","\"- I don't think anybody's gonna like it.\""]
["08:23,060","08:26,420","\"- Because also, the adult portion is just flashbacks\""]
["08:26,420","08:30,580","\"mostly anyways. They're not establishing really anything like, oh we're adults now,\""]
["08:30,580","08:35,860","\"here's what we're doing as adults. They hop to each one like, here's where I am. Okay,\""]
["08:35,860","08:40,380","\"hey, remember when we rode a bike when we were kids? And then they flash back to the\""]
["08:40,380","08:45,300","\"bike. Remember that scene when there are two of them are adults riding on the bike together?\""]
["08:45,300","08:50,500","\"I thought it was kind of like a homoerotic subject. It did, it did. I don't know if that\""]
["08:50,500","08:56,340","\"was intentional or not. Oh my god, the original is so goofy. I can't believe anyone was\""]
["08:56,340","08:59,340","\"ever really got afraid of it. It's just a lot of fun.\""]
["08:59,340","09:04,820","\"It is that is baffling to me that anybody thought it was scary. It's really funny.\""]
["09:04,820","09:09,340","\"I mean I guarantee you everyone who says that saw it as a very young child.\""]
["09:09,340","09:15,060","\"I imagine. Yeah. I admit. Because I remember I scared of two creepy visuals\""]
["09:15,060","09:20,340","\"in it as a kid. Yeah. But not Pennywise. Dude there's some parts in the new one like\""]
["09:20,340","09:23,940","\"okay so there's some kind of jump scary moments but they're actually kind of\""]
["09:23,940","09:31,400","\"Good in a way their jump scares that makes sense. They're not just there Chris what look at that jump scare\""]
["09:31,400","09:35,860","\"Well, we should go through an entire level if captain Hook just\""]
["09:35,860","09:41,800","\"Being drunk and it if captain Hook just ran through the room at that speed and screamed in your face\""]
["09:41,800","09:46,220","\"That's pretty much the new it in a nutshell. Well, exactly. That's why I'm not feeling\""]
["09:48,860","09:52,020","\"What I'm nervous about I'm really nervous if it's gonna do stuff like that\""]
["09:52,020","09:55,960","\"Not because it's scary because that's the kind of thing. I don't want from it\""]
["09:55,960","10:02,900","\"I don't want just what I like about it the idea of that movie in general is that it tastes fear better than things that\""]
["10:02,900","10:08,300","\"Don't that aren't afraid which is cool concept so I mean he has to turn it to things. He knows we'll scare things\""]
["10:08,300","10:12,860","\"I just he says that in the yeah, yeah, it's just a cool. I'm just saying. Okay. I love it\""]
["10:12,860","10:16,820","\"And I like it. I like it even more that like I like movies with like\""]
["10:17,860","10:19,860","\"Kids instead of adults a lot more I think\""]
["10:19,860","10:26,460","\"Yeah, I agree. I wish there were more movies about kids. It's true. I don't know why that's time mature situations\""]
["10:26,460","10:33,380","\"Because that's a big part of being a child as you get you got thrust into situations you can't everyone keeps saying like oh\""]
["10:33,380","10:36,420","\"That's an 80s reference, but it's like no that was just a that was a common thing\""]
["10:36,420","10:43,320","\"It's kids movies were about kids getting it like remember sandlot stuff like that. No, it's more threatening when you're a kid\""]
["10:43,320","10:46,680","\"*Screams*\""]
