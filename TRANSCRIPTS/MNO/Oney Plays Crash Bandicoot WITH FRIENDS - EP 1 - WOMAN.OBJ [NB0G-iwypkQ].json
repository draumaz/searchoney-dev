["02:10,820","02:15,180","\"No, you're just a fucking asshole.\""]
["02:15,180","02:17,580","\"Are you doing the first level again or is it just the same?\""]
["02:17,580","02:18,980","\"Looks the same.\""]
["02:18,980","02:19,780","\"There's the skunk.\""]
["02:19,780","02:20,820","\"It appears from nowhere.\""]
["02:20,820","02:23,460","\"This game is so nostalgic for me.\""]
["02:23,460","02:24,740","\"Do you want that big coin?\""]
["02:24,740","02:27,260","\"I played this game before I even had a playstation.\""]

["02:29,460","02:29,960","\"No.\""]
["02:29,960","02:31,060","\"She doesn't exist anymore.\""]
["02:31,060","02:34,160","\"How are they gonna, how are they gonna justify that in the new game?\""]
["02:34,160","02:37,660","\"Uh, they're gonna keep her in the redo.\""]
["02:37,660","02:39,660","\"Well, I know they're gonna keep her, but how are they gonna justify it?\""]
["02:39,660","02:40,160","\"They changed the opening.\""]
["02:40,160","02:41,960","\"Remember she punches the guy in the opening.\""]
["02:41,960","02:45,260","\"How are they gonna justify the fact that she's never in any game ever again?\""]
["02:45,260","02:52,660","\"Uh, they are, Nadia already has that in the Bible for Crash Bandicoot.\""]
["02:52,660","02:58,200","\"That's right. I forgot she's probably talked about that. She's dating pinstripe. What really? Yeah, that's sad\""]
["02:58,200","03:03,940","\"Cress saves her and then she dates a fucking piece of shit. You don't know maybe he's a really good guy\""]
["03:03,940","03:07,200","\"No, he's an asshole. How do you know? He says over the tap?\""]
["03:07,200","03:16,900","\"He's okay, you did it you got all he's eating her lady woman objects. Oh my god\""]
["03:16,900","03:20,420","\"Do you get to play as her?\""]
["03:20,420","03:25,660","\"Get the shaver heard. I mean wrong. She's just motionless. She really is an object\""]
["03:25,660","03:30,500","\"Just clearly with what if her following name was woman dot OBJ\""]
["03:30,500","03:33,660","\"slut dot OBJ\""]
["03:33,660","03:36,820","\"Wasn't even OBJ would have his dot objectified\""]

["03:39,940","03:43,580","\"Mappin cool. Okay. I'm gonna do one more one more and this your turn\""]
["03:44,100","03:48,200","\"From this day now. I like the island map screen. Why did it go by by?\""]
["03:48,200","03:51,720","\"Because did like it when you suck into a door I?\""]
["03:51,720","03:59,180","\"You know it I like to how it works too, but three is weird to me that you have to hold the buttons down to get into the level\""]
["03:59,180","04:02,800","\"Oh, yeah, it is weird. It takes a lot more time. Oh, man. I just tried\""]
["04:02,800","04:07,900","\"Crouch jumping and I forgot you can't do it in this one. I guess it doesn't take a lot more time\""]
["04:07,900","04:09,200","\"It's kind of weird\""]
["04:09,200","04:16,400","\"Why is he jumping so slowly what the fuck is that's how it controls no, he's like slowing down\""]
["04:16,400","04:19,360","\"That's how he controls. I don't remember that\""]
["04:19,360","04:25,440","\"He also didn't have his slide yet. I think I love his slide in this crouch\""]
["04:25,440","04:34,760","\"Look how epic this is check the music's also very quiet in this game. There isn't too much going on with it\""]
["04:34,760","04:37,840","\"Is that Munko they redid all the music for the Japanese one?\""]
["04:37,840","04:39,840","\"Is it any good?\""]
["04:39,840","04:41,840","\"Well, okay, that was bullshit.\""]

["09:33,640","09:35,640","\"- That's you, my mother.\""]
["09:35,640","09:40,640","\"- That's the noise she makes when she comes out of my bathroom\""]
["09:40,640","09:42,640","\"mirror at night.\""]
["09:42,640","09:45,640","\"- Do you have to say your mom's name three times to call her?\""]
["09:45,640","09:46,640","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:46,640","09:50,640","\"Watch as it hits me even though I've been really stalled out.\""]
["09:50,640","09:53,640","\"Oh, I'm nervous.\""]
["09:53,640","09:54,640","\"Yeah, that's makes me nervous.\""]
["09:54,640","09:55,640","\"Oh my God.\""]
["09:55,640","09:59,640","\"Oh, I thought I was going to kill you anyway.\""]
["09:59,640","10:00,640","\"Good boy.\""]
["10:00,640","10:02,640","\"Oh, I still like how the water looks in this level.\""]
["10:02,640","10:06,640","\"You know, you don't get bumped up in the sequels when you're, uh, when you're hit.\""]
["10:06,640","10:08,640","\"You have the mask, right?\""]
["10:08,640","10:11,640","\"Um, no, I think in this one, you don't get bumped up.\""]

["10:13,640","10:16,760","\"The fish hit me and I got launched upwards a little bit for doing that.\""]
["10:16,760","10:20,720","\"See that's why it confused me when the spike didn't do that.\""]
["10:20,720","10:24,200","\"The spike is because you were invincible though and it was...\""]
["10:24,200","10:27,880","\"That was weird that it just stopped you dead in your tracks so you fell.\""]
["10:27,880","10:28,880","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:28,880","10:30,880","\"It seems like it just acts weird in this one.\""]
