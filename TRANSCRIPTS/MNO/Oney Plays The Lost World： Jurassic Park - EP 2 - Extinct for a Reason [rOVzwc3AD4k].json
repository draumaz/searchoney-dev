["00:05,640","00:11,600","\"*laughs* Do you remember that weird- do you remember that weird era of games where they'd have like actual like film footage as the cutscenes?\""]
["00:11,600","00:12,100","\"Yeah?\""]
["00:12,100","00:17,960","\"They'd walk around a house. Where the fuck voice those? They're all- they're all voice so like oddly.\""]
["00:17,960","00:24,400","\"\"\"Come here little dinosaur. Come here my little friend.\"\" *laughs* He runs like such a goober. *laughs*\""]
["00:24,400","00:28,720","\"*groans* *laughs* Oh that jump animation ain't so good.\""]
["00:28,720","00:29,920","\"Oh yeah, he can swing.\""]
["00:29,920","00:30,920","\"What?\""]
["00:30,920","00:33,920","\"Did he just shoot a grappling hook out of his throat?\""]
["00:33,920","00:34,920","\"Out of his gun.\""]
["00:34,920","00:35,920","\"Okay, it's out of his gun.\""]
["00:35,920","00:38,720","\"That looked like he just like spat it out like fucking Yoshi.\""]
["00:38,720","00:41,720","\"He's one of those holes in his throat where he can just go.\""]
["00:41,720","00:43,720","\"Oh fuck, there's a big big big big.\""]
["00:43,720","00:46,720","\"Oh, one of those like, I smoked a bit of cigarettes and now I...\""]
["00:46,720","00:47,720","\"You can shoot a web out of him.\""]
["00:47,720","00:48,720","\"Holy fuck!\""]
["00:48,720","00:51,720","\"Now I talk like daft punk all the time.\""]
["00:51,720","00:52,720","\"I can't eat.\""]
["00:52,720","00:53,720","\"That'd be pretty awesome.\""]
["00:53,720","00:54,720","\"Does he get dinosaur angry too?\""]
["00:54,720","00:56,720","\"Or is that a different bar now?\""]
["00:56,720","00:57,720","\"I don't know what that is.\""]
["00:57,720","01:01,720","\"Also, I can't eat the dinosaurs to get my health back no more, which is poo poo.\""]
["01:01,720","01:03,720","\"I would like that more.\""]
["01:03,720","01:05,720","\"But now you get the swing.\""]
["01:05,720","01:08,720","\"You know what? The swinging controls in this are actually kind of fun.\""]
["01:08,720","01:12,720","\"They seem like underwhelmingly easy to kill.\""]
["01:12,720","01:13,720","\"These big dinosaurs?\""]
["01:13,720","01:14,720","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:14,720","01:16,720","\"Do you guys ever play Tarak? Is Tarak good?\""]
["01:16,720","01:18,720","\"It was when I was nine.\""]
["01:18,720","01:21,720","\"Okay, yeah, that's about the memory I have of it.\""]
["01:21,720","01:23,720","\"Like, I remember playing it on the Dreamcast.\""]
["01:23,720","01:25,720","\"It was only one kid. The rich kid always had the Dreamcast.\""]
["01:25,720","01:29,620","\"had the dream cast and I remember going over to the rich kids house and they had like an n64 one\""]
["01:29,620","01:32,080","\"- oh they did pretty sure no\""]
["01:32,080","01:43,900","\"So it looks like they're just coming over to say hi. No, hello. I can't get up this fucking shithole\""]
["01:43,900","01:48,840","\"Don't swing in controls are really good. It's Chris. They were\""]
["01:48,840","01:54,680","\"Second ago, wait, don't don't like move just just jump straight up grapple up. Yeah. Yeah, I can't get in\""]
["01:54,680","01:56,680","\"Can you crouch walk like Megaman?\""]
["01:56,680","01:58,040","\"Uh, slide?\""]
["01:58,040","02:00,200","\"Uh, I'm curious to see what this animation was.\""]
["02:00,200","02:01,720","\"Oh, you can roll like this.\""]
["02:01,720","02:02,200","\"Okay, that's good.\""]
["02:02,200","02:03,000","\"This is fun.\""]
["02:03,000","02:04,920","\"Yee-haw-ee.\""]
["02:04,920","02:06,920","\"This game is exactly like Dark Souls.\""]
["02:06,920","02:08,440","\"Oh, you're an action man.\""]
["02:08,440","02:09,440","\"Eeee.\""]
["02:09,440","02:10,960","\"Look at my combat roll.\""]
["02:10,960","02:14,680","\"My pants helped me blend into the environment.\""]
["02:14,680","02:15,800","\"Hey Chris.\""]
["02:15,800","02:17,800","\"Not that the dinosaurs will see my legs.\""]
["02:17,800","02:22,200","\"They'll only try to eat my torso where a majority of my organs are.\""]
["02:22,200","02:22,760","\"All of them.\""]
["02:22,760","02:23,480","\"Take that,\""]
["02:23,480","02:26,120","\"all of the viewers are gonna think\""]
["02:26,120","02:29,960","\"i'm poo poo but i swear to god this game controls a shit there's gonna be like\""]
["02:29,960","02:33,560","\"one person that played this is a twelve-year-old they're gonna be like\""]
["02:33,560","02:34,520","\"um\""]
["02:34,520","02:38,440","\"i'm thirty two now yeah there's some kind of definitively say that my recollection\""]
["02:38,440","02:40,360","\"of how good i was at this game\""]
["02:40,360","02:44,440","\"is not only crystal clear but i can also criticize you from that perspective\""]
["02:44,440","02:47,400","\"and i think you're not very good at it yes i'm a little kid who played this at\""]
["02:47,400","02:50,360","\"the arcade every day and they spent quite and it's not an arcade game\""]
["02:50,360","02:56,360","\"Chris let me have my moment I'm sorry Chris if if if they found one of your\""]
["02:56,360","03:00,280","\"ancestors ugh O'Neill and he was like a Neanderthal what would you think he\""]
["03:00,280","03:06,720","\"worked as mmm probably a mud slapper who would that would that entail the guy\""]
["03:06,720","03:14,280","\"sits at a table slapping pieces of mud together oh shit I'm dead most you found\""]
["03:14,280","03:20,460","\"out that your ancestor had the biggest table made of the most mud I think that\""]
["03:20,460","03:24,160","\"would get him the most bitches back then I'd be so proud like whoa he biggest\""]
["03:24,160","03:30,860","\"table in land I don't think this game has fucking checkpoints although it is\""]
["03:30,860","03:34,340","\"no score count or checkpoints it's like you just keep going yeah I've got to\""]
["03:34,340","03:37,860","\"say this level is probably longer so far than any of the levels you play\""]
["03:37,860","03:40,560","\"The green story it's like almost sad to play this\""]
["03:40,560","03:50,120","\"That's the funnest part of the game so far\""]
["03:50,120","04:04,940","\"Here lies Marine O'Neill I love this guy he died\""]
["04:06,180","04:11,140","\"Yeah, how do I do that if you do that to a dinosaur will it fall?\""]
["04:11,140","04:18,980","\"We'll try it next time. Let's try it. It's a huge problem with games these days not enough sliding\""]
["04:18,980","04:23,460","\"Yeah, I agree. No, not that slide right into that fucking thing. They think that\""]
["04:23,460","04:27,260","\"Under its legs. Yeah, that's actually pretty cool. That is pretty cool\""]
["04:27,260","04:31,980","\"They think having the same encounter over and over and over in the exact same environment is fun\""]
["04:31,980","04:34,940","\"Do you think that they think that or do you think they just can't do any better?\""]
["04:34,940","04:37,540","\"I'm shooting a dinosaur, so you better you better cut that out now\""]
["04:37,540","04:40,820","\"Otherwise you'll be extinct next\""]
["04:40,820","04:45,580","\"This guy sucks. Let's let's let's play it. They're pretty good.\""]
["04:45,580","04:47,420","\"Press the kill and button.\""]
["04:47,420","04:48,620","\"You know what Lyle?\""]
["04:48,620","04:49,460","\"Yeah, what's up?\""]
["04:49,460","04:51,660","\"This is the coolest fucking thing in the game.\""]
["04:51,660","04:52,860","\"The Velociraptor?\""]
["04:52,860","04:53,860","\"Yeah\""]
["04:53,860","04:57,420","\"He's a victim of senses?\""]
["04:57,420","04:59,020","\"Yeah, he's not allowed to vote.\""]
["04:59,020","05:03,340","\"He's being targeted for discriminatory voter laws.\""]
["05:04,220","05:06,780","\"This is actually kind of cool. I like playing as him.\""]
["05:06,780","05:09,020","\"Let me show you.\""]
["05:09,020","05:13,900","\"It was a record show that Chris just turned up the volume for some reason.\""]
["05:13,900","05:14,620","\"Look at this!\""]
["05:14,620","05:21,180","\"You like that?\""]
["05:21,180","05:23,020","\"Oh, Nelly.\""]
["05:23,020","05:27,020","\"Oh, they got you with the trap door. You must feel a fool now.\""]
["05:27,020","05:27,580","\"Oh, silly guy.\""]
["05:27,580","05:28,140","\"Oh, listen to this.\""]
["05:28,140","05:33,420","\"And tell me they didn't go on Watch People Die and find some like screaming clips.\""]
["05:33,420","05:35,740","\"I don't think watch people die existed at this point.\""]
["05:35,740","05:36,320","\"Look at that.\""]
["05:36,320","05:36,780","\"You've ended it.\""]
["05:36,780","05:39,020","\"You're digging him.\""]
["05:39,020","05:40,540","\"This is watch dinosaurs fly.\""]
["05:40,540","05:43,140","\"Holy shit, those are bombs.\""]
["05:43,140","05:44,620","\"Were they though?\""]
["05:44,620","05:45,100","\"What the?\""]
["05:45,100","05:46,160","\"Whoa!\""]
["05:46,160","05:48,020","\"That guy had an acid gun.\""]
["05:48,020","05:52,220","\"Jesus, that kills you fast.\""]
["05:52,220","05:58,700","\"Well, the Raptor gets 22 lives.\""]
["05:58,700","05:59,260","\"Does he?\""]
["05:59,260","06:02,020","\"It said you had 22 lives.\""]
["06:02,020","06:02,820","\"Mm.\""]
["06:02,820","06:09,540","\"That's fucking stupid like cats cats have nine lives Raptors have 22\""]
["06:09,540","06:20,660","\"Fucking zero lives point two of a life. Did you bury him already cuz he's gonna run through the other eight pretty fast\""]
["06:20,660","06:25,060","\"Oh, no, he's just he's made out of black dust now. Look at these guys. There's such goofballs\""]
["06:25,060","06:55,020","\"Oh, no, no, no, no. You're like that guy tried to get a sentence out. No, yeah, they go. Oh, it's grabbed on him. It's a really weird weapon. You get like a poison launcher. The Raptor controls worse than the little dinosaur, believe it or not. I would assume that.\""]
["06:55,020","06:57,020","\"like the further into this game that you get.\""]
["06:57,020","06:58,940","\"Does the T-Rex control good or no?\""]
["06:58,940","06:59,780","\"- No.\""]
["06:59,780","07:03,980","\"- Also they made the raptor do a flip.\""]
["07:03,980","07:06,060","\"- That's pretty cool.\""]
["07:06,060","07:08,020","\"Does that do anything?\""]
["07:08,020","07:08,860","\"- No.\""]
["07:08,860","07:12,740","\"- Oh dude, they have the saliva.\""]
["07:12,740","07:13,580","\"- Did you see that?\""]
["07:13,580","07:14,420","\"- Did they?\""]
["07:14,420","07:15,420","\"- Yeah, do that again.\""]
["07:15,420","07:16,900","\"- Oh yeah, that's sweet.\""]
["07:16,900","07:19,660","\"Yeah, when I was younger, I was like,\""]
["07:19,660","07:22,020","\"this is the best moment of my life.\""]
["07:22,020","07:23,980","\"And then I just kept dying like within a minute.\""]
["07:23,980","07:25,860","\"It's not fun at all.\""]
["07:25,860","07:28,980","\"Also look, those fucking raptors are massive.\""]
["07:28,980","07:30,340","\"- So I'm saying, are they the raptors?\""]
["07:30,340","07:31,180","\"- Look at that!\""]
["07:31,180","07:33,140","\"- And they hit you while you're like eating them.\""]
["07:33,140","07:34,140","\"- Or are you just a baby?\""]
["07:34,140","07:35,900","\"(laughing)\""]

["07:38,020","07:39,540","\"- T-Rex fucking sucks!\""]
["07:39,540","07:41,300","\"Look at how fast they kill you!\""]
["07:41,300","07:43,780","\"- They just fucking hit you while you're in the animation.\""]
["07:43,780","07:45,780","\"- Yeah, you don't really see like a badass T-Rex,\""]
["07:45,780","07:47,780","\"really, do you, if you guys are fast from little wiener.\""]
["07:47,780","07:49,140","\"- Is there a button that lets you poop\""]
["07:49,140","07:50,860","\"or hit with your tail while you're doing that?\""]
