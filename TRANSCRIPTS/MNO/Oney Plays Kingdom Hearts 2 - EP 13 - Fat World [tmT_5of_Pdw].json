["01:58,440","02:00,860","\"What is this fat world premise\""]
["02:00,860","02:04,560","\"Did you pitch this yet?\""]

["03:04,720","03:10,260","\"How would that throw you off a community speaking in unison?\""]
["03:10,260","03:15,500","\"Like if every character in the show had to work that way, but they had to speak in unison with that at the same time\""]
["03:15,500","03:19,100","\"Would that warp your mind having to like adapt to that watching it?\""]

["15:59,280","16:00,280","\"Yeah.\""]
["16:00,280","16:03,720","\"But I used to put pennies on top of that, and if you hold your finger near the penny,\""]

["16:06,780","16:07,700","\"Holy shit, no kidding.\""]

["16:13,940","16:15,020","\"Because it was just weird.\""]
["16:15,020","16:16,180","\"Because it tasted good.\""]

["16:26,480","16:29,580","\"How did you discover this?\""]
["16:29,880","16:34,940","\"Because I put a penny on top of it and I noticed the the things shot into my finger and burnt a little black hole in my finger\""]
["16:34,940","16:38,600","\"And then you went maybe I should do it again. I was stupid. I was like what?\""]

["17:08,340","17:10,020","\"- That's what that does though.\""]
["17:10,020","17:11,800","\"- Like sometimes you'll be unplugging a thing\""]
["17:11,800","17:14,940","\"and you'll get a little jolt, but you don't actually,\""]
["17:14,940","17:15,780","\"you know.\""]
["17:15,780","17:17,800","\"- Well I had that happen was that there was no light bulb\""]
["17:17,800","17:20,120","\"and my finger ended up going in\""]
["17:20,120","17:21,960","\"and it didn't even feel like anything.\""]
["17:21,960","17:23,200","\"Like it just felt like numbness\""]

["17:24,800","17:25,640","\"- Yeah.\""]
["17:25,640","17:26,480","\"- Then it's pretty comfortable.\""]
["17:26,480","17:27,640","\"- Then there's pain right afterwards.\""]
["17:27,640","17:33,200","\"Grabbed electric fences growing up just because my grandpa used to do it and he'd be like it tickles\""]

["18:00,580","18:06,320","\"I remember grabbing the electric fence and it doesn't feel like anything. It just feels like bones are popping out of place like like\""]
