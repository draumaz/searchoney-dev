["11:17,820","11:19,020","\"I feel really bad for the guy.\""]
["11:19,020","11:21,920","\"He kickstarted his own unique game with the same web slinging.\""]

["11:25,820","11:26,820","\"Aw, why not?\""]
["11:26,820","11:33,620","\"Well, I think part of his problem is he was like too optimistic because he put the goal at like one dollar and he was like,\""]
["11:33,620","11:36,320","\"\"\"Yeah, just whatever you want to give, you know?\"\"\""]
["11:36,320","11:39,560","\"He should have made it what he actually needed.\""]
["11:39,560","11:44,480","\"Even then, most of those fucking games, they really underestimate how much they need.\""]
["11:44,480","11:49,200","\"Which I think is one thing that gets them into a lot of trouble, especially when you have kickstarter goals.\""]
["11:49,200","11:51,480","\"It's like, \"\"I'm gonna put multiplayer in the game!\"\"\""]
["11:51,480","11:54,640","\"And then you can't cut it if you go over budget.\""]
["11:54,640","11:55,880","\"- Yeah. - So...\""]
["11:55,880","11:59,880","\"The whole point is, I think you should just start really small, just stay really small.\""]
["11:59,880","12:01,120","\"- Don't make a view of you. - Oh fuck.\""]
["12:01,120","12:03,520","\"Yeah, he was gonna make...\""]

["12:08,320","12:09,800","\"It's never gonna happen\""]
["12:09,800","12:15,840","\"Well what he was doing was it was gonna have like spider-man type swinging and it was gonna be almost more like a like a Tony\""]
["12:15,840","12:17,360","\"Hot kind of game like it was gonna\""]
["12:17,360","12:20,720","\"Tricks and stuff\""]
["12:20,720","12:27,600","\"It seemed pretty pretty neat, but yeah, I don't think it ever actually ended up happening\""]
["12:28,600","12:33,200","\"Speaking of which the new spider-man game looks like it has zero weight or fun\""]
