["02:23,760","02:25,460","\"Those are the lyrics.\""]
["02:25,460","02:27,420","\"- It's in every version of it.\""]
["02:27,420","02:29,420","\"You don't get to hear what he says.\""]
["02:29,420","02:31,820","\"(sings)\""]
["02:31,820","02:35,580","\"We have the full show.\""]
["02:35,580","02:36,420","\"We got it.\""]
["02:36,420","02:40,020","\"- We bought it for, what was it, like 35 bucks or something?\""]
["02:40,020","02:42,420","\"- I think it was only 30, which is fine.\""]
["02:42,420","02:43,820","\"It's like 55 episodes.\""]
["02:43,820","02:45,660","\"- You learn about race or acts as dark past?\""]
["02:45,660","02:47,940","\"- Yeah, they had to repeat it each episode\""]
["02:47,940","02:49,260","\"the first fucking episode.\""]
["02:49,260","02:50,980","\"- Well, no, they repeated it the second time too\""]
["02:50,980","02:53,100","\"because he has him in his bed\""]
["02:53,100","02:54,980","\"- And he has to tell him a second time.\""]
["02:54,980","02:58,140","\"And then when he wakes up, he decides to put his mask on\""]
["02:58,140","03:00,620","\"and then get beaten upside the head for doing it.\""]
["03:00,620","03:02,580","\"- It's really obvious nowadays,\""]
["03:02,580","03:05,980","\"like because fan fiction is so common now,\""]
["03:05,980","03:08,780","\"like people just do it for every fucking thing.\""]
["03:08,780","03:12,620","\"But way back in the '60s, do you think any kid\""]
["03:12,620","03:14,540","\"that was watching it, like a 16 year old girl\""]
["03:14,540","03:17,500","\"was really turned on by the fact that their brothers\""]
["03:17,500","03:19,220","\"and he was sleeping in his bed,\""]
["03:19,220","03:20,060","\"they thought they were--\""]
["03:20,060","03:22,100","\"- Probably, probably a little bit.\""]
["03:22,100","03:24,100","\"It's a weird, he goes naked into the shower.\""]
["03:24,100","03:25,380","\"- Yeah. - And he sees him there.\""]
["03:25,380","03:26,540","\"- It's very homo-erotic.\""]
["03:26,540","03:28,620","\"- Remember he puts a mask on to look at him in the shower.\""]
["03:28,620","03:30,100","\"- There's, why does he put the mask on?\""]
["03:30,100","03:31,500","\"- I don't know, why does he put the mask on?\""]
["03:31,500","03:32,660","\"- There's no mask on to put the mask on.\""]
["03:32,660","03:33,500","\"- That's the first thing he does.\""]
["03:33,500","03:34,820","\"He wakes up and doesn't know where he is,\""]
["03:34,820","03:37,260","\"and he sees the mask, so he puts it on.\""]
["03:37,260","03:39,940","\"- It's 'cause it's a cute moment, okay?\""]
["03:39,940","03:41,380","\"- When he gets hit upside the head\""]
["03:41,380","03:43,660","\"and when all the children on the racetrack die.\""]
["03:43,660","03:46,060","\"- They're upside the head, then your mother is dead.\""]
["03:46,060","03:47,740","\"- They really like murdering people.\""]
["03:47,740","03:48,820","\"- They sure do.\""]
["03:51,620","03:52,700","\"That's a pleasant sound.\""]
["03:52,700","03:53,940","\"Why did the box laugh?\""]
["03:53,940","03:57,540","\"Nintendo knows everything about sound design.\""]
["03:57,540","04:00,700","\"How big do you think is Mario's bank account?\""]
["04:00,700","04:02,940","\"How big do you think is Mario's cock?\""]
["04:02,940","04:04,660","\"Cock.\""]
["04:04,660","04:06,860","\"He probably used a mushroom on it.\""]
["04:06,860","04:09,140","\"He just eased the mushroom.\""]
["04:09,140","04:10,300","\"You know what? I'm sorry for making that.\""]
["04:10,300","04:11,700","\"Then he gets high.\""]
["04:11,700","04:12,820","\"Jesus.\""]
["04:12,820","04:14,020","\"Then he kills him.\""]
["04:14,020","04:16,660","\"He jumped by the goob butt and he's leaving everywhere.\""]
["04:16,660","04:19,060","\"That is based on up on drugs.\""]
["04:19,060","04:19,700","\"No.\""]
["04:19,700","04:20,620","\"Imagine that.\""]
["04:20,620","04:25,260","\"Wouldn't the Goomba bleed he go oh mama me that's almost happened usually\""]
["04:25,260","04:31,100","\"Almost as if drugs have been a part of our human culture for thousands of years\""]
["04:31,100","04:34,220","\"It's almost like anyone can write a video game parody even you\""]
["04:34,220","04:35,100","\"Even me?\""]
["04:35,100","04:37,100","\"Yeah I'm a bitch and Chris if you do it\""]

["04:45,660","04:46,140","\"Are you?\""]
["04:46,140","04:46,780","\"Have you?\""]
["04:46,780","04:49,740","\"Yeah I made Grand Theft Awesome left for speed\""]
["04:49,740","04:50,240","\"Oh.\""]
["04:50,240","04:51,740","\"Final Fantasy 7.\""]
["04:51,740","04:53,840","\"Oh yeah, it's fucking stupid, of course.\""]
