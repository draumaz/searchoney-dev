["08:51,100","08:53,500","\"as much as I want until the end of the dream.\""]
["08:53,500","08:55,100","\"Today I had a very specific dream.\""]
["08:55,100","09:00,180","\"Usually I see my mom or I'm traveling or meeting new people, but today I saw Stefan.\""]
["09:00,180","09:03,060","\"We played hide and seek and I hid in the closet in my room.\""]
["09:03,060","09:05,620","\"And you can't turn the face.\""]
["09:05,620","09:07,140","\"Oh there you go.\""]
["09:07,140","09:08,900","\"Then I felt something strange behind my back.\""]
["09:08,900","09:13,020","\"It was hot air like from the oven when I turned around to see where the air was coming from.\""]
["09:13,020","09:15,660","\"It was like I fell through the closet wall.\""]
["09:15,660","09:18,180","\"Behind the closet was a cave made entirely of fire.\""]
["09:18,180","09:19,260","\"Flames are everywhere.\""]
["09:19,260","09:20,260","\"I was scared.\""]
["09:20,260","09:22,620","\"Suddenly something appeared out of the flame ready to come at me.\""]
["09:22,620","09:23,620","\"Then I woke up.\""]
["09:23,620","09:25,900","\"You know, normal little girl dream stuff.\""]
["09:25,900","09:27,900","\"I freaking love this presentation.\""]
["09:27,900","09:29,460","\"It's really good.\""]
["09:29,460","09:30,460","\"Ants.\""]
["09:30,460","09:31,460","\"Suffocation.\""]
["09:31,460","09:32,460","\"Perhaps this is a very safe--\""]
["09:32,460","09:33,460","\"Vamrication!\""]
["09:33,460","09:34,460","\"Suffocation!\""]
["09:34,460","09:39,620","\"\"\"Uh, perhaps this is a very strange world for a 13 year old girl, but unfortunately\""]
["09:39,620","09:41,780","\"it has been with me for as long as I can remember.\""]
["09:41,780","09:44,180","\"It is difficult for me to live surrounded by strangers.\""]
["09:44,180","09:48,780","\"I think that all I need is my family, but my mom says that the people need society, that\""]
["09:48,780","09:51,660","\"we need to communicate with each other, or we'll go crazy.\""]
["09:51,660","09:55,060","\"That often visits my school to remind my teachers and to inform new teachers that I\""]
["09:55,060","09:56,980","\"have asthma.\""]
["09:56,980","09:58,260","\"It's always the same.\""]
["09:58,260","10:01,900","\"My girl absolutely cannot be exposed to stressful situations.\""]

["10:03,700","10:05,940","\"I've now memorized this phrase by heart.\""]
["10:05,940","10:09,380","\"I just stand to the side and silently watch the teacher say sorry and we will do everything\""]
["10:09,380","10:11,540","\"possible to ensure this won't happen.\""]
["10:11,540","10:15,020","\"Of course everyone respects my father because he's the most well-known pharmacist in our\""]

["10:16,020","10:19,060","\"But today was a bad day and not only for me.\""]
["10:19,060","10:20,060","\"This is a lot.\""]
["10:20,060","10:22,100","\"I woke up in my bedroom.\""]
["10:22,100","10:25,860","\"My dad was sitting beside me and my mom was nearby holding a glass of water.\""]

["10:41,460","10:44,060","\"I really wish I could have helped them, but I didn't know how.\""]
["10:44,060","10:46,220","\"I stood crying silently with my head down.\""]
["10:46,220","10:47,620","\"Christian laughed.\""]
["10:47,620","10:48,620","\"LOUDLY.\""]
["10:48,620","10:50,460","\"And he destroyed the remains of the hill.\""]
