["07:56,960","08:00,200","\"And even they even framed it so that you can't see the other guy\""]
["08:00,200","08:04,440","\"So in this case, it's just like you and your brother once again leaping on rooftops\""]
["08:04,440","08:09,460","\"Except now you're getting shot at what a predicament that Nathan and his brother have gotten himself into\""]
["08:09,460","08:15,800","\"The predicament at first they were just children, but now they're running from the law\""]
["08:15,800","08:20,520","\"It seems that not much has changed now that your brother is framed behind you\""]
["08:20,520","08:26,660","\"It implies that something bad is going to happen to him that there's a slight disconnection that is building up between the two brothers\""]
["08:26,660","08:28,400","\"What?\""]
["08:28,400","08:30,400","\"You're giving it away\""]

["09:01,380","09:14,240","\"My bro is helping me out. That's like a Chrono trigger team up attack\""]
["09:16,720","09:19,780","\"Bro, we got to go through the dough no\""]
["09:19,780","09:25,360","\"We go through the flow. It's just like when you push the thing as a kid\""]
["09:25,360","09:31,820","\"Wait, no, you did it later. You're really isn't a dull. Never mind. I'm glad it taught me how to do it as an adult\""]

["10:05,720","10:10,320","\"My god, this place is like a base. Why did he say that in the most linear spot in the game?\""]
["10:10,320","10:12,680","\"It's like a field of corn. It's like a base\""]
["10:14,800","10:18,360","\"That's more like a maze to be fair. It's like you can't find your way out. I\""]
["10:18,360","10:21,360","\"Met cuz like corn is called maze\""]
["10:21,360","10:29,800","\"That would have been harmful for your hands. Oh\""]
