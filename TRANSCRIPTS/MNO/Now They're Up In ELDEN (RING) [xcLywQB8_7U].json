["02:31,020","02:38,340","\"Yeah, that little light dagger move I still have no fucking idea how to dodge that and I've beat this guy like multiple times\""]

["03:31,820","03:36,060","\"You'll learn to love him. He's like the final boss. He is actually I\""]
["03:36,060","03:40,700","\"There's like maybe one or two bosses in this game that I think are harder than him\""]
["03:40,700","03:45,140","\"But I do think he's like a crazy difficulty spike very early. Yeah\""]
["03:45,140","03:48,740","\"Can I tell you a bit of a great filter? Yeah?\""]
["03:48,740","03:55,700","\"Yeah, that move is the one thing that I think is like actually total bullshit about him\""]
["03:56,140","04:01,060","\"Because sometimes he does it and sometimes he doesn't so you'll think like oh yeah\""]
["04:01,060","04:07,100","\"I learned this combo is like a good opening and then he'll pull out his funny little dagger and immediately fuck you fuck\""]

["07:16,640","07:19,540","\"I mean, how long till they called time of death\""]
["07:19,540","07:21,320","\"in the hospital after you fly out line?\""]

["07:43,560","07:45,640","\"Everyone looks at me crazy when I say this,\""]
["07:45,640","07:48,920","\"but genuinely the hardest Dark Souls boss for me\""]
["07:48,920","07:51,240","\"was the iron golem that you fight\""]
["07:51,240","07:52,560","\"at the end of Senn's fortress.\""]
["07:52,560","07:53,400","\"- That's insane.\""]
["07:53,400","07:55,120","\"- Yeah, because every time it would hit me,\""]
["07:55,120","07:56,480","\"it would just knock me off the edge.\""]
["07:56,480","07:58,320","\"And I never found the,\""]

["08:07,760","08:16,680","\"That's maybe like a billion I think I maybe took like 30 to 40 tries to be because I never found the loop back either\""]
["08:16,680","08:20,360","\"So I would I would run the whole entirety of sends fortress\""]
["08:20,360","08:25,160","\"I would get hit once and I'd immediately die and then I would just have to fucking run back\""]
["08:25,160","08:29,640","\"So I had no idea what the fuck it even did because the first time you hit me. Oh\""]
["08:29,640","08:34,960","\"That is so mean dude so mean\""]
