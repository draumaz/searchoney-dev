["08:33,300","08:35,140","\"nightmare\""]
["08:35,140","08:40,580","\"What a beautiful day. I love Sundays because I lay in my bed until noon. For some reason\""]
["08:40,580","08:42,580","\"I remember my dreams quite well on Sundays\""]
["08:42,580","08:46,540","\"Maybe it's because I can't sleep as much as I want until the end of the dream today\""]
["08:46,540","08:50,580","\"I had a very specific dream usually I see my mom or I'm traveling or meeting new people\""]
["08:50,580","08:55,480","\"But today I saw Stefan we played hide and seek and I hid in the closet in my room\""]
["08:55,480","08:59,020","\"And you can't turn the face. Oh there you go\""]
["08:59,020","09:01,680","\"Then I felt something strange behind my back\""]
["09:01,680","09:05,680","\"It was hot air like from the oven when I turned around to see where the air was coming from\""]
["09:05,680","09:10,800","\"It was like I fell through the closet wall behind the closet was a cave made entirely of fire\""]
["09:10,800","09:16,060","\"Flames are everywhere. I was scared suddenly something appeared out of the flame ready to come at me then I woke up\""]
["09:16,060","09:22,520","\"You know normal little girl dream stuff. I freaking love this presentation. It's really good ants\""]
["09:22,520","09:25,720","\"Suffocation perhaps this is a very very\""]

["09:28,240","09:34,540","\"Uh, because, uh, perhaps this is a very strange world for a 13-year-old girl, but unfortunately, it has been with me for as long as I can remember.\""]
["09:34,540","09:41,580","\"It is difficult for me to live surrounded by strangers. I think that all I need is my family, but my mom says that the people need society.\""]
["09:41,580","09:49,280","\"That we need to communicate with each other, or we'll go crazy. That often visits my school to remind my teachers and to inform new teachers that I have asthma.\""]
["09:49,280","09:54,520","\"It's always the same. My girl absolutely cannot be exposed to stressful situations.\""]
["09:54,520","09:56,620","\"In case of an emergency, here's my phone number.\""]
["09:56,620","09:58,860","\"I've now memorized this phrase by heart.\""]

["10:04,480","10:07,960","\"Of course everyone respects my father because he's the most well-known pharmacist in our\""]
["10:07,960","10:12,000","\"town, but today was a bad day and not only for me.\""]
["10:12,000","10:14,000","\"This is a lot.\""]
["10:14,000","10:17,520","\"I woke up in my bedroom, my dad was sitting beside me and my mom was nearby holding a\""]
["10:17,520","10:18,800","\"glass of water.\""]
["10:18,800","10:21,280","\"The last thing I can recall is my classmate Christian.\""]
["10:21,280","10:24,000","\"He and his friends burned an anhal right by my feet.\""]
["10:24,000","10:28,100","\"I felt really sorry for those little creatures who scattered in fear in every direction,\""]
