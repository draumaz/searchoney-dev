["08:01,180","08:03,540","\"Getting out of the car was really stupid.\""]
["08:03,540","08:07,220","\"But Driver 3 was supposed to be like the new Grand Theft Auto.\""]
["08:07,220","08:08,220","\"Yep.\""]
["08:08,220","08:11,060","\"Well, it was going to beat out Grand Theft Auto and release and everything too.\""]
["08:11,060","08:12,620","\"Like it was going to be a big thing.\""]
["08:12,620","08:13,620","\"Yeah.\""]

["08:17,020","08:18,020","\"No, it is.\""]
["08:18,020","08:22,340","\"And I remember the thing I liked most about Driver 1 and 2 was the replay editor.\""]
["08:22,340","08:25,480","\"Because it was like it was the first game that did a kind of write\""]
["08:25,480","08:29,980","\"but um in the third game you could like play for like 30 minutes and\""]
["08:29,980","08:33,580","\"Then you go back to the replay editor to make a movie about what you just play. Oh, yeah\""]
["08:33,580","08:37,220","\"I love I oh, and you take like running into a wall and I\""]
["08:37,220","08:43,240","\"I love the idea that I just because the game was so broken. Yeah, it was just like going out of sync with itself\""]
["08:43,240","08:48,420","\"And then made me think wow, I guess it just can't be done and then halo 3 came out. It was perfect\""]
["08:48,420","08:49,960","\"Yeah, no, you can do it easily.\""]
["08:49,960","08:52,040","\"It's just that they didn't set it up in a good way.\""]
["08:52,040","08:53,420","\"It's 'cause they had to rush the game out.\""]
["08:53,420","08:55,760","\"They needed like another year to develop it\""]
["08:55,760","08:57,360","\"and they didn't get the time for it.\""]
["08:57,360","08:59,840","\"Did Halo 3 have a, yeah, it did have a replay.\""]
["08:59,840","09:00,680","\"Yeah, it did.\""]
["09:00,680","09:01,520","\"Yeah, it was fun.\""]
["09:01,520","09:04,160","\"Halo 3 was really good how they set it up.\""]
["09:04,160","09:05,640","\"It had a lot.\""]
["09:05,640","09:09,120","\"So what's your motivation for painting a graffiti?\""]
