["10:43,380","10:46,260","\"So no one would steal it. How would you how would you access it?\""]
["10:46,260","10:47,580","\"Would you have an escape route?\""]
["10:47,580","10:52,420","\"You'd have to turn it to the exact right temperature and let like the exact right amount\""]
["10:52,420","10:53,620","\"It's a combination of hot\""]
["10:53,620","10:58,060","\"Fuck so just you have a guest over in there just trying to like get the temperature right\""]

["11:29,180","11:35,300","\"Yeah, this reassemble and just copies your atom somewhere else. Isn't that technically what teleportation is?\""]
["11:35,300","11:39,300","\"Yeah, that's what some people's definition of teleportation is I I\""]
["11:39,300","11:44,860","\"Disagree that that's what teleportation would be if we invented it. Is that how it works in Star Trek?\""]
["11:44,860","11:48,760","\"No, I think the idea is it's just like it's\""]
["11:48,760","11:53,920","\"Decompiling you and really just makes you you you're still there\""]
["11:53,920","11:59,800","\"I think it's still supposed to be you wouldn't it be better to just my copy you and then just have two versions of you\""]

["12:28,480","12:33,800","\"Fucking hideout. I know some people would have a crazy sex dungeon or I want a little hobbit hole\""]
["12:33,800","12:39,240","\"Giant robot sex robots and shit if I could have any type of house\""]
["12:39,240","12:42,640","\"It would be a hobbit house because you want to stick your your hobbit wiener an hobbit hole\""]
