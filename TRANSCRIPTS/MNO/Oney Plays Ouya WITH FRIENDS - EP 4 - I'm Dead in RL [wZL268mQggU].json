["09:08,600","09:11,640","\"There's a little trick you can do in this\""]
["09:11,640","09:19,040","\"It's only in the sport if I can get back up there. I think you're back up there. I gotta go around. How the hell should I know ding-dong?\""]
["09:19,040","09:21,440","\"Okay, good job\""]
["09:21,440","09:29,660","\"Listen this deep-head feels like garbage. I think you know it's true\""]
["09:29,660","09:36,460","\"You know as well as me how hard this thing is you use feels real cheap - this is not the right console be playing this game\""]
["09:36,460","09:38,460","\"I'll say that\""]
["09:38,460","09:41,100","\"It's not actually on the PC. It's on everything\""]
["09:41,100","09:45,460","\"Here here's a fun trick you can do\""]
["09:45,460","09:48,220","\"just in this one\""]
["09:48,220","09:51,340","\"Like a line up with it if you uh\""]
["09:51,340","09:56,380","\"You have to be at top speed to go back to the pass because if you just do this\""]
["09:56,380","09:58,940","\"Oh wait, I hit a wall\""]
["09:59,060","10:01,060","\"Well, what did you do?\""]
["10:01,060","10:05,180","\"Hang on I got I got line up with it. You can go back to the past in the first level\""]
["10:05,180","10:10,860","\"Oh, I have to think it's a good ending but you do that\""]
["10:10,860","10:15,420","\"I messed it up. You have to be at top speed, but if you if you do\""]
["10:15,420","10:18,700","\"As Corey was playing this I showed this\""]
["10:18,700","10:23,820","\"Can I say the oooh your controller is maybe one of the worst I have ever felt in my entire life\""]
["10:23,820","10:25,820","\"There's no worse than the steam controller.\""]
["10:25,820","10:28,220","\"A nice lady worked on it.\""]
["10:28,220","10:30,420","\"Because the steam controller at least is responsive.\""]
["10:30,420","10:31,420","\"This thing is not.\""]
["10:31,420","10:33,620","\"This thing lags whatever it feels like it too.\""]
["10:33,620","10:34,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:34,620","10:36,620","\"The trick is that...\""]
["10:36,620","10:38,620","\"Because you're supposed to hit top speed.\""]
["10:38,620","10:39,620","\"Yeah, see, you can just do that.\""]
["10:39,620","10:40,620","\"Oh!\""]
["10:40,620","10:43,620","\"So if you just do the skin bash and you hit a spring and you pull back onto it,\""]
["10:43,620","10:45,620","\"you can just stay there and do it.\""]
