["06:05,360","06:10,600","\"I wouldn't say that it's I wouldn't say it's a bad design. I think it's good. He's compact\""]
["06:10,600","06:13,360","\"compact for a for a\""]
["06:13,360","06:15,840","\"platformer character has to be really\""]

["06:21,240","06:24,080","\"he's got to be\""]
["06:25,120","06:29,200","\"- In order to, since jumping around is the priority,\""]
["06:29,200","06:34,200","\"you want it to maintain more or less the same space\""]
["06:34,200","06:35,520","\"from every angle.\""]
["06:35,520","06:36,600","\"- Is that like a--\""]
["06:36,600","06:37,640","\"- I don't think that's a rule.\""]
["06:37,640","06:39,520","\"That's just a thing that I've noticed in games\""]
["06:39,520","06:42,840","\"'cause like the, remember when we were playing Nightmare\""]
["06:42,840","06:45,240","\"before Christmas, it feels really awkward\""]
["06:45,240","06:47,640","\"to have like a really tall character jumping around.\""]
["06:47,640","06:48,620","\"- That's very true.\""]
["06:48,620","06:52,240","\"- Whereas all the best platformers,\""]
["06:52,240","06:55,520","\"I feel like they have really compact character designs.\""]

["07:03,800","07:05,440","\"Crash Bandicoot feels pretty good and he's--\""]
["07:05,440","07:07,320","\"- He mean he's stout, not stout.\""]
["07:07,320","07:09,480","\"He's fucking, he's got like no fun in that.\""]
["07:09,480","07:13,200","\"- He's still more compact than an actual human shape.\""]
["07:13,200","07:15,440","\"The fact that he doesn't have a neck\""]
["07:15,440","07:18,040","\"does a lot to squash him down.\""]
["07:18,040","07:18,880","\"- Look at that guy.\""]
["07:18,880","07:21,880","\"- Ooh, oh my god, that was cool.\""]

["08:31,160","08:33,160","\"Why didn't they just put a heads up display?\""]
["08:33,160","08:34,440","\"- It's the same thing as the mask\""]
