["22:33,800","22:34,980","\"- Playing for rail.\""]
["22:34,980","22:36,120","\"- You're pretty cool, Mick.\""]
["22:36,120","22:38,840","\"- You know, that's what my mom says.\""]
["22:38,840","22:40,280","\"- And?\""]
["22:40,280","22:41,360","\"- Before she died.\""]
["22:41,360","22:46,320","\"Oh, sorry, but last words she ever said you're pretty cool\""]
["22:46,320","22:50,160","\"You're pretty good. I\""]
["22:50,160","22:53,440","\"Couldn't even think or I\""]
["22:53,440","23:01,240","\"Hope that none of my friends are family ever die screaming. Yeah, I hope like a giant falcon doesn't swoop down and carry your mother away\""]
["23:01,240","23:03,240","\"What she's in front of you?\""]
["23:03,240","23:09,680","\"I don't know if she was already like dying or dead. I feel like that would be like a sign from God that she was ascending into heaven\""]
["23:10,040","23:17,760","\"Okay, Tomar. Yes. Would you be mad if I put vaccines in a Eagles talons and had it attack you?\""]
["23:17,760","23:26,600","\"What are the vaccines? They like just like the latest flu shot. Yeah, but they may cause autism. I mean I'd be\""]
["23:26,600","23:32,040","\"I'd be upset that you had a bird attack me. I wouldn't be upset about being vaccinated\""]
["23:32,040","23:34,240","\"But I only did it because you wouldn't get vaccinated\""]
["23:35,000","23:40,920","\"What I would get vaccinated. This is an alternate universe where you want to do it. I'm an anti-vaxxer\""]
["23:40,920","23:45,360","\"So I have to use the power of an eagle. Yeah, I suppose I'd be upset\""]
["23:45,360","23:50,960","\"Would you be upset in this universe that I did it to you in another universe?\""]
["23:50,960","23:57,680","\"Oh that you like me standing here watching you teach anti-vaxxer me a lesson. Yeah, I guess not\""]
["23:57,680","24:00,840","\"But then you dive autism in the other world\""]
["24:01,640","24:08,240","\"So in that other world anti-vaxxers were correct. Yes. Oh, I said that just gets really complicated\""]
["24:08,240","24:15,280","\"And you also get more powerful in this dimension. Oh, then I'm totally for it if it's like the one with jet lead\""]
["24:15,280","24:18,280","\"Exactly\""]
["24:18,280","24:20,280","\"That movie was silly\""]
["24:20,280","24:26,080","\"Because isn't there like millions of alternate dimensions you would have to do that millions of times I\""]
["24:27,360","24:31,880","\"Mean it would be more than millions right wouldn't it be like virtually an unlimited amount\""]
["24:31,880","24:39,200","\"Yeah, it's like the idea of that alternate dimension theory where it's like any time a dislike a decision is made in any way\""]
["24:39,200","24:47,560","\"Like the universe just branches off into both out into all different all possible outcomes. Yeah, supposedly I\""]
["24:47,560","24:51,240","\"Mean it would be virtually unlimited dimensions\""]
["24:52,080","24:57,700","\"There's a dimension where I pulled down both of your pants right now and sucked you both off for no reason\""]
