["00:04,360","00:05,520","\"With friends...\""]
["00:05,520","00:07,040","\"Did anybody mention a bottle?\""]
["00:07,040","00:08,340","\"I don't remember.\""]
["00:08,340","00:12,160","\"I don't think a bottle was discussed.\""]
["00:12,160","00:15,120","\"Maybe it's over for a later town. Who knows?\""]
["00:15,120","00:17,120","\"I'm gonna go back down to this town here real quick.\""]
["00:17,120","00:18,160","\"See if there was anything.\""]
["00:18,160","00:20,480","\"What were the two other things that got mentioned?\""]
["00:20,480","00:21,440","\"It was a glove?\""]
["00:21,440","00:22,800","\"A handy glove.\""]
["00:22,800","00:23,840","\"And the mirror.\""]
["00:23,840","00:24,480","\"A mirror.\""]
["00:24,480","00:25,360","\"Oh my god.\""]
["00:25,360","00:27,760","\"Maybe that thing you got was the mirror and we just were looking at it here.\""]
["00:27,760","00:28,720","\"Oh, a red mirror?\""]
["00:28,720","00:29,980","\"That was the fucking mirror.\""]
["00:29,980","00:30,820","\"What?\""]
["00:30,820","00:32,980","\"The must have looked like an upside down mirror.\""]
["00:32,980","00:34,140","\"Oh.\""]
["00:34,140","00:37,640","\"I figure like every time I see a mirror in a game, it's like an oval.\""]
["00:37,640","00:38,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:38,300","00:39,820","\"And it's white.\""]
["00:39,820","00:41,380","\"The best thing to come up with.\""]
["00:41,380","00:43,880","\"Maybe it really was the mirror.\""]
["00:43,880","00:45,820","\"So which town had the mirror bitch?\""]
["00:45,820","00:47,020","\"This I think it was this.\""]
["00:47,020","00:48,060","\"Oh, that makes sense.\""]
["00:48,060","00:49,020","\"I think it was this one.\""]
["00:49,020","00:49,580","\"That's it.\""]
["00:49,580","00:50,180","\"Yes.\""]

["00:52,180","00:52,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:52,500","00:53,180","\"She lost her.\""]
["00:53,180","00:55,140","\"Lost my mirror.\""]
["00:55,140","00:56,020","\"So we don't have the mirror.\""]
["00:56,020","00:57,220","\"No, we have the catch up.\""]
["00:57,220","00:57,780","\"Damn it.\""]
["00:57,780","01:00,180","\"How do we even see what we picked up?\""]
["01:00,180","01:03,380","\"Damn it. We got the ketchup\""]
["01:03,380","01:08,540","\"Okay, just get over it. I forgot that we never actually did the palace because we were too weak, right? Oh\""]
["01:08,540","01:14,900","\"I thought it was just because you guys I think it was because we wanted to explore and I wanted that hammer\""]
["01:14,900","01:15,700","\"Oh, okay\""]
["01:15,700","01:19,620","\"So we wouldn't have to like look if we keep dying at the palace that way we can just loop back down\""]
["01:19,620","01:24,780","\"Gotcha, and we didn't have to go through the fucking cave that is when Mick brought up the idea of going for the hammer\""]
["01:24,780","01:26,260","\"Oh\""]
["01:26,260","01:28,260","\"Really? Yeah\""]

["01:30,540","01:32,820","\"That's so right. Yeah, it's that way\""]
["01:32,820","01:36,380","\"I think it's to the right and then it's up and then you just kind of loop back\""]
["01:36,380","01:38,580","\"Yeah\""]
["01:38,580","01:42,340","\"Oh, Barry come back come back come back. Oh, gosh. Give us a key\""]

["10:39,320","10:42,520","\"No, oh you can't that\""]
["10:42,520","10:46,840","\"Not that that particularly helps you can create your own arena\""]
["10:47,600","10:52,080","\"It's Minecraft you do that yeah, actually you do need to do that sometimes\""]
["10:52,080","10:55,280","\"But that's dangerous because sometimes you'll fall through and get stuck\""]
["10:55,280","10:58,120","\"Well, no you'll fall to like through a pit. Oh, yeah\""]
["10:58,120","11:01,680","\"So like you'll want to stomp on enemies like that, but then they kill you\""]
["11:01,680","11:08,920","\"Nice Chris. Oh come on. I got you. I got you. I got you. I watch out. You fucking jumps forward\""]
["11:08,920","11:13,900","\"You jump like here if you go to the top of it don't break all of them, but you can break up\""]
["11:15,720","11:19,120","\"You can break a path all the way down sometimes and there's like things\""]
["11:19,120","11:25,200","\"There might be items and stuff. I don't know if they put that like that. This is a good day. That was a bomb\""]
["11:25,200","11:33,400","\"This is interesting now, yeah, I'm making a little tunnel. This is like the first Minecraft\""]
["11:33,400","11:42,760","\"Chris yep, you can't you can't say that I can't say what I want you can't say the M word on\""]
["11:43,560","11:45,560","\"The M were MC\""]
["11:45,560","11:49,400","\"Okay, okay be careful\""]
["11:49,400","11:53,600","\"Good call\""]
["11:53,600","11:58,520","\"No, let's come back for later because you know what if you get it. It's permanently gone. Oh really?\""]
["11:58,520","12:03,200","\"You died and it's just gone forever. That's true and you have one and a half health and oh fuck my\""]
["12:03,200","12:05,400","\"Be you can jump over to this guy\""]
["12:05,400","12:11,080","\"It's got the momentum. Oh, he's got a speed. Did you see that? I sure did\""]
["12:12,720","12:15,860","\"Suck ass loser loser. Wait, you got a key? Oh\""]
["12:15,860","12:21,100","\"That's not good no more if you were working in a castle\""]
["12:21,100","12:26,280","\"Like if this was your job to just sit here in a castle and fucking stop somebody from doing something I\""]
["12:26,280","12:33,080","\"Take my job very seriously. What would be your weapon of choice? Oh fuck off like\""]
["12:33,080","12:35,600","\"Like a big heavy machine gun\""]
["12:37,680","12:42,720","\"That seems very effective. I would love if we ran into an enemy that had that just a big fucking machine gun\""]
["12:42,720","12:48,840","\"With definitely like a big cheap ass like armored shell around it. Yeah, I if that was my job\""]
["12:48,840","12:52,040","\"I you know I'd want to be as safe as possible. It's very responsible\""]
["12:52,040","12:57,840","\"Wait, is there even a point of killing the boss at this point? So we have the handy glove. Yeah, yeah\""]
["12:57,840","12:59,840","\"You got to put the Ruby in the thing\""]
["12:59,840","13:06,200","\"I think technically you don't have to I think we got everything we need but you can't beat the game\""]
["13:06,200","13:09,640","\"The game without doing it I think you need to have the Ruby in there eventually\""]
["13:09,640","13:16,320","\"But you could technically move on and come back and kill it okay. I think that's why they show it crumbled or not crumbled\""]
["13:16,320","13:18,520","\"gotcha\""]
["13:18,520","13:20,960","\"Chris with this amount of health. I want you to go beat the boss\""]
