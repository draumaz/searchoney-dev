["05:55,100","05:58,260","\"I'm not gonna lie. I felt like an actual serial killer right for that\""]
["06:00,060","06:02,060","\"It's so fucking great right there\""]
["06:02,060","06:05,220","\"I was gonna say you felt like you should like you felt alive\""]
["06:05,220","06:09,220","\"Do you think maybe there is like like you know the way like games don't cause violence and that shit\""]
["06:09,220","06:15,140","\"Like I believe games don't cause violence. I believe there's a little column a look\""]
["06:15,140","06:16,540","\"I don't think on the whole yeah\""]
["06:16,540","06:22,060","\"I was going to be violent because you play video games. No, but like do you think maybe when young kids\""]
["06:22,060","06:28,420","\"See violent video games there. They are likely to emulate them. Yeah, I'm willing to believe that because I know I did\""]
["06:29,060","06:30,260","\"Yeah, you guys are fucked though.\""]
["06:30,260","06:35,960","\"I went and saw the Mortal Kombat movie and then like had little street fights with my friends right after.\""]
["06:35,960","06:41,460","\"Yeah, but that conversation always comes up, that debate always comes up, you have to do a fucking school shooting.\""]

["06:50,220","06:56,620","\"Here's my point. If you're a fucking maniac who's gonna kill somebody, you're gonna be drawn to stuff that's violent anyways\""]
["06:56,620","07:03,060","\"And all you got to do is look at is look at the population that plays video games versus people actually shoot up schools\""]
["07:03,060","07:05,260","\"Or shoot up fucking offices or whatever\""]
["07:05,260","07:08,000","\"It's like probably point zero zero zero zero zero zero\""]
["07:08,000","07:13,100","\"If you if you went and found every kid that shot up a thing and we're like all these guys played video games\""]
["07:13,100","07:17,460","\"But then you compared that to like any normal sample of high school students\""]
["07:17,460","07:22,180","\"I don't know. You know, it's fine that the odds are that a kid that shoots up a school play video games\""]
["07:22,180","07:24,620","\"Is the odds are that any like random kid?\""]

["07:50,720","07:54,780","\"Well, you're talking about the whole argument that you just like you like rock\""]
["07:54,780","08:00,500","\"I mean that I agree that is by the way if it is it's because it's been pushed to like the fucking illegal market\""]
["08:00,500","08:05,500","\"So they're for your forced to interact with a drug dealer who sells everything rather than just sells or dispense to the sells\""]
["08:05,500","08:10,100","\"We'd but yeah with the video games of violence thing. I think you have to acknowledge the grains of truth that yeah\""]

["19:07,740","19:09,740","\"It makes no sense.\""]
["19:09,740","19:14,660","\"No, like people are just trying to be smart, but they're just trying to say like yeah, they're too easy\""]
["19:14,660","19:18,980","\"I see I see that a lot of animation or somebody complains about something and it's like they really don't know\""]

["19:22,620","19:26,300","\"They want to sound smarter. They want to give a more sophisticated answer\""]
["19:26,300","19:30,260","\"Well, I think they just want to articulate their saying they don't want to be impeded by the fact that they're talking about\""]
["19:30,260","19:32,820","\"So you just kind of fill the blanks with whatever I guess but like whatever\""]
["19:32,820","19:36,020","\"That's a big thing with that YouTube cart like the animation reviewing community\""]
["19:36,260","19:40,480","\"When they're talking about like why they're like a TV show they really are just like completely missing\""]
["19:40,480","19:46,100","\"Like they'll complain like let's say it's badly storyboarded. They'll say like it's badly like animated\""]
["19:46,100","19:50,420","\"So let's not bet no the like it's the posers are what's not good here the animations fine\""]
["19:50,420","19:53,100","\"Yeah, like the actually between okay, it's just badly bored\""]
["19:53,100","19:58,060","\"I mean one people in bronies used to talk about my little point to be like the animation is super fucking good\""]
["19:58,060","20:03,500","\"It's like you know, it's actually fine, but it's not amazing like what are you talking about it by the way super fluid\""]
["20:03,860","20:07,740","\"Yeah, no, I saw one person literally go like I counted the frames\""]
["20:07,740","20:09,240","\"No, I'm not talking about you\""]
["20:09,240","20:13,700","\"But one thing I saw of somebody explaining how it's amazing was that there was like a firefly in the background\""]
["20:13,700","20:19,460","\"Like this there's a firefly. This is such a small detail, but it's amazing. It's like dude. That was it\""]
["20:19,460","20:23,460","\"That's like a little track. It took literally probably probably one minute to it\""]
["20:23,460","20:27,260","\"It's a little particle. Yeah a little flash thing and they just put it on a track and made a loop\""]
["20:27,260","20:29,620","\"Yeah, literally takes I did that when I was like 14\""]
["20:29,620","20:33,340","\"Which is like finally you like that. Let's say you're wrong. I'm just saying that that's not\""]
["20:33,820","20:40,200","\"You can also create particle systems that animate for you people like something they'll find a reason to pick apart the details on how everything's\""]
["20:40,200","20:44,100","\"Amazing about it, and it always works. I get that everybody can have the right way\""]
["20:44,100","20:48,860","\"I'm just saying it gets annoying when this one's being negative about it, and they don't look the fuck to talk you about it\""]
["20:48,860","20:50,280","\"It's like I like to I agree you know\""]
["20:50,280","20:55,760","\"I you're allowed to not like something but to not know what you're talking about to make a whole one hour long YouTube video about it\""]
["20:55,760","21:03,700","\"It's breaking it apart. You know, you know, it's there is kind of like a growing community of like armchair animation experts aren't there's a lot of them\""]
["21:03,700","21:07,800","\"I'm gonna give a fire started. I think I think critique is great\""]
["21:07,800","21:10,860","\"I'm just saying if you're gonna do a 30 minute video or 20 minute break down\""]
["21:10,860","21:15,140","\"Well, you don't like something if you're gonna criticize something you should also be educated in it\""]
["21:15,140","21:18,800","\"100% but you could in the field in which it exists\""]
["21:18,800","21:24,760","\"You could still say I don't like this, but I'm specifically talking about you're breaking something down to its chords explaining\""]
["21:24,760","21:30,040","\"I don't like it. I'd go so far as to say that if you're gonna make a video specifically about it exactly\""]
["21:30,100","21:33,660","\"Yeah, exactly you you owe your audience and you owe yourself\""]
["21:33,660","21:40,120","\"It comes well if you make a video about something there's a kind of a unspoken like you speak you the authority\""]
["21:40,120","21:45,940","\"Whatever you have to make a video about it. Mm-hmm. I also see people ragging on CG way too much when they don't know what they're talking about\""]
["21:45,940","21:52,460","\"CG if it's done right which it is a lot of the time is is is is invisible you can see yeah, it's like amazing\""]
["21:52,460","21:57,060","\"That's how good see some CGI is you it's so good that you don't know it's there, but then when it's used in anime\""]
["21:57,060","22:00,080","\"It's usually terrible. Yeah, but but the big the biggest\""]
["22:00,080","22:04,240","\"complaints what CGI is with is when it's animated poorly. Yeah, the bottles of\""]
