["07:15,100","07:16,140","\"through the year or something.\""]
["07:16,140","07:17,380","\"I think so, yeah.\""]
["07:17,380","07:21,060","\"I had a sixth grade teacher who did absolutely nothing.\""]
["07:21,060","07:25,980","\"She would come in and her exercises and studies\""]
["07:25,980","07:27,620","\"were things like, OK.\""]
["07:27,620","07:30,700","\"Today we're going to do reading.\""]
["07:30,700","07:33,100","\"Go take a book, go read in the corner.\""]
["07:33,100","07:33,940","\"- Oh boy.\""]
["07:33,940","07:35,420","\"- She was just an incompetent teacher.\""]
["07:35,420","07:36,260","\"- She just did nothing.\""]
["07:36,260","07:37,100","\"- I have to teach you teachers like that.\""]
["07:37,100","07:37,940","\"- She would do that.\""]
["07:37,940","07:40,100","\"She'd tell kids to just read.\""]
["07:40,100","07:42,660","\"And half the time she just wouldn't even show up to class\""]
["07:42,660","07:45,260","\"because she'd say like, \"\"Oh, I'm sick.\"\"\""]
["07:45,260","07:47,020","\"And she'd take a week off.\""]
["07:47,020","07:48,820","\"And eventually by the end of the year,\""]
["07:48,820","07:51,180","\"she flat-out disappeared and we had a new teacher.\""]
["07:51,180","07:52,380","\"And we asked about what happens\""]
["07:52,380","07:53,540","\"'cause she got fired.\""]
["07:53,540","07:55,100","\"Apparently a bunch of kids reported her\""]
["07:55,100","07:57,100","\"just because she wasn't doing anything.\""]
["07:57,100","07:59,200","\"She wasn't teaching, she wasn't coming in.\""]
["07:59,200","08:02,180","\"And she ended up getting fired for just not working.\""]
["08:02,180","08:03,180","\"- I had a teacher.\""]
["08:03,180","08:05,140","\"- What happens after a teacher gets fired?\""]
["08:05,140","08:07,580","\"Like how easy is it for them to get a new job?\""]
["08:07,580","08:09,700","\"- It's not even a good job, by the way.\""]
["08:09,700","08:10,700","\"It pays like shit.\""]
["08:10,700","08:12,700","\"- Yeah, no teaching is like the worst thing.\""]
["08:12,700","08:15,340","\"- If you were like Blacklisted completely from that\""]
["08:15,340","08:18,060","\"as a career, do you get Blacklisted?\""]

["08:21,980","08:23,220","\"and everything because you get fired.\""]
["08:23,220","08:25,540","\"It wasn't like you had, you were quitting\""]
["08:25,540","08:31,040","\"Everything is a smooth transition out. I don't think you're gonna ignore that you got cuz that happens with any job if you flat out\""]
["08:31,040","08:34,040","\"Got fired. Yeah, that's a thing that they can see. Yeah, that's true\""]
["08:34,040","08:37,200","\"I told you about the teacher who said I threw a nail in her eyeball, right?\""]
