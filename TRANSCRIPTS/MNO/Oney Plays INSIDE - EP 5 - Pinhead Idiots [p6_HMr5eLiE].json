["07:07,400","07:12,000","\"The reason his voice is like that is because it's supposed to be like an overdubbing, like\""]
["07:12,000","07:15,560","\"a kung fu movie, but it's just funny that it gave me the impression that he's just like\""]
["07:15,560","07:16,560","\"an alien robot.\""]
["07:16,560","07:17,920","\"No, that's why though.\""]

["07:23,600","07:24,600","\"No, no way.\""]
["07:24,600","07:25,600","\"Makes way funnier than that.\""]

["07:28,040","07:30,120","\"I refuse to believe that.\""]
["07:30,120","07:31,640","\"Why would they make him a kung fu movie?\""]
["07:31,640","07:33,280","\"That would make that sense.\""]
["07:33,280","07:34,360","\"There was a reason I forget.\""]
["07:34,360","07:36,280","\"Zuckerberg loves kung fu.\""]

["07:42,560","07:45,240","\"came to the same conclusion that he's a fucking creep.\""]
["07:45,240","07:46,080","\"Well, everyone knew that.\""]
["07:46,080","07:48,400","\"Sure, the messages were leaked years ago,\""]

["08:31,700","08:37,940","\"Everyone was just uniform and it was like the same well profile looks the exact same and I think I think the reason people like that\""]
["08:37,940","08:40,940","\"Is because everybody likes customizing their own profile\""]
["08:40,940","08:46,500","\"Everybody hates looking at everybody else's fucking when they auto play music especially that's the\""]
["08:46,500","08:50,800","\"The main thing I used to love beeped up your beep on whole yeah\""]
