["00:08,380","00:09,360","\"*Sigh*\""]
["00:09,360","00:10,600","\"With friends!\""]
["00:10,600","00:14,360","\"I bet- I bet he's got a whole packet of orange juice in his pouch.\""]
["00:14,360","00:18,440","\"I bet he's got a whole... I- I hope he- I think he chews tobacco.\""]
["00:18,440","00:19,640","\"*Laugh*\""]
["00:19,640","00:21,940","\"I bet he smokes big golem cigar.\""]
["00:21,940","00:24,100","\"I put it with golem cigar. *Laugh*\""]
["00:24,100","00:25,340","\"Golem cigar.\""]
["00:25,340","00:27,560","\"What golem's Jewish to learn?\""]
["00:27,560","00:29,640","\"Like uh, like the- Like a Jewish golem.\""]
["00:29,640","00:36,280","\"I think it originates in some sort of Jewish folklore in the town of Prague.\""]
["00:36,280","00:37,760","\"What, really?\""]
["00:37,760","00:38,760","\"Really?\""]
["00:38,760","00:45,280","\"The whole thing with the Gullum was it had the word \"\"emit\"\" on its head, which means truth.\""]
["00:45,280","00:50,160","\"But then if you erased the olive, that was how they eventually defeated the Gullum.\""]
["00:50,160","00:51,720","\"You just take a big eraser to the right?\""]
["00:51,720","00:53,160","\"It just said \"\"met.\"\"\""]
["00:53,160","00:56,000","\"Well, I think you could just rub it out because he's made out of clay.\""]
["00:56,000","00:57,760","\"And...\""]
["00:57,760","00:59,080","\"What a shitty fucking...\""]
["00:59,080","01:05,340","\"And it just says met, which literally means dead, or death, or something to that effect.\""]
["01:05,340","01:10,080","\"So basically some guy noticed in Hebrew, he was like, \"\"Hey, these two words are really similar.\""]
["01:10,080","01:14,700","\"We don't make a story if you rub a letter out that'll kill a character.\"\"\""]
["01:14,700","01:17,920","\"Yes, because the Gullum was invincible otherwise.\""]
["01:17,920","01:19,820","\"And he was supposedly created as...\""]
["01:19,820","01:26,620","\"Like, the idea of the Gullum was he was supposed to protect the Jews from all the people that wanted to hurt them.\""]
["01:26,620","01:28,860","\"You say the Gullum could have prevented the Holocaust?\""]
["01:28,860","01:31,860","\"-Yes, that's what I'm saying. -I'm not trying to be edgy of being serious.\""]
["01:31,860","01:33,660","\"That's a real historical claim.\""]
["01:33,660","01:37,140","\"-I feel like that's the sort of events in Jewish history\""]
["01:37,140","01:39,980","\"that even prompted the invention of the Gullum. -The Gullum.\""]
["01:39,980","01:42,580","\"-Yeah. -He's a protector.\""]
["01:42,580","01:45,580","\"-I learned so much about Gullum, the Pokémon.\""]
["01:45,580","01:47,060","\"[laughter]\""]
["01:47,060","01:48,860","\"The Jews created the Pokémon Gullum.\""]
["01:48,860","01:54,860","\"-That's true, as a fact. -The Pokémon Gullum used to stand outside of Israel with a spear.\""]
["01:54,860","01:58,260","\"-If you go to B&H photos, you see a million Gullum Pokémon standing around.\""]
["01:58,260","02:00,180","\"- Explain what that is.\""]
["02:00,180","02:03,260","\"There's a B&H photo in Manhattan.\""]
["02:03,260","02:05,940","\"It's run by like Hasidic Jews.\""]
["02:05,940","02:10,460","\"- Yeah, so they're wearing their curls and stuff.\""]
["02:10,460","02:12,460","\"- Yeah, and they close on Sundays at like,\""]
["02:12,460","02:14,340","\"I think they close all day Sunday.\""]
["02:14,340","02:15,180","\"- Are you Saturday?\""]
["02:15,180","02:16,580","\"- Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday.\""]
["02:16,580","02:17,780","\"- I mean Saturday, yeah.\""]
["02:17,780","02:19,260","\"- As in the best day.\""]
["02:19,260","02:20,420","\"- And they have a gold guardian.\""]
["02:20,420","02:23,540","\"- All I'm saying is pretty pissed off about that.\""]
["02:23,540","02:24,580","\"- Since they're trying to rub out the word,\""]
["02:24,580","02:26,060","\"the letter on the gold on his head.\""]
["02:26,060","02:27,700","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:27,700","02:29,700","\"He rubbed at the wrong line.\""]
["02:29,700","02:30,900","\"He made it more powerful.\""]
["02:30,900","02:32,740","\"Did that kid just fucking fly into my back?\""]
["02:32,740","02:34,740","\"He's gonna watch.\""]
["02:34,740","02:36,740","\"He's like a little spider monkey. What the fuck?\""]
["02:36,740","02:38,740","\"It's a little kibuki.\""]
["02:38,740","02:43,940","\"My boy is a monkey now.\""]

["03:19,220","03:21,220","\"You can do vertical leaps, or is that the leaps?\""]
["03:21,220","03:25,620","\"What if every time the child jumped, it would play that Pixar short song, \"\"Bound,\""]
["03:25,620","03:43,620","\"Hah! Jump and rebound. You know that's the thing. Try the thing. I do just wish the kids fucking skull. Oh, oh, this is the same as the puzzle from before but now it is with a different mechanism so that makes it okay.\""]
