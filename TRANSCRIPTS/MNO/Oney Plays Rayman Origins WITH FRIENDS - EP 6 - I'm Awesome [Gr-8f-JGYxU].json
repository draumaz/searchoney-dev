["00:34,360","00:40,960","\"Yeah, but it's never like to add to anything. It's just a habit of a bag. It sounds awesome. It adds atmosphere\""]
["00:40,960","00:44,560","\"It does you could probably use it for a good like baseline or something\""]
["00:44,560","00:48,700","\"I heard a really cool song with the didgeridoo once was it gonna like\""]

["00:59,080","01:02,120","\"Literally any sound ever can be good in a song.\""]
["01:02,120","01:03,720","\"You just have to find a place to put it.\""]
["01:03,720","01:05,640","\"What about this one?\""]

["03:31,860","03:33,380","\"He's in the opening cup\""]
["03:33,380","03:36,460","\"They introduce a lot of characters in Rayman 2 and they just don't use them.\""]
["03:36,460","03:36,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:36,960","03:39,460","\"I like Rayman 2.\""]

["03:55,180","03:57,060","\"It's cool that they're little men.\""]
["03:57,060","03:59,660","\"Like he doesn't seem like a character that would take off.\""]
["03:59,660","04:00,820","\"It's really strange.\""]
["04:00,820","04:02,660","\"Speak for yourself.\""]

["04:16,820","04:17,820","\"I think he is.\""]
["04:17,820","04:18,820","\"I think everyone likes Rayman.\""]

["04:22,660","04:23,660","\"Rayman.\""]
["04:23,660","04:26,420","\"Rayman, I don't know.\""]
["04:26,420","04:28,980","\"Rayman's very popular in Europe, isn't he?\""]
["04:28,980","04:29,980","\"In France.\""]

["04:40,940","04:44,060","\"They make up a bunch of characters.\""]
["04:44,060","04:45,780","\"And it's really weird.\""]
["04:45,780","04:48,820","\"I kind of like it for how--\""]
["04:48,820","04:50,660","\"like, it's like--\""]

["04:54,540","04:55,340","\"or something.\""]
["04:55,340","04:58,060","\"And there's a detective that's always following them.\""]
["04:58,060","04:58,560","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:01,860","05:05,560","\"I would say the last episode in the series is the only one worth watching.\""]
