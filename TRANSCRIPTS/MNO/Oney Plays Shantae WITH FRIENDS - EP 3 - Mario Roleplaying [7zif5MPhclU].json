["00:18,800","00:20,480","\"What's with you in soft spots lately?\""]
["00:20,480","00:22,480","\"I love it. Soft spot's the new re-third.\""]

["00:24,000","00:24,960","\"You fucking soft spot.\""]
["00:24,960","00:26,480","\"Keep that shit up, boar!\""]
["00:28,160","00:30,160","\"I don't talk to people with soft spots.\""]
["00:30,160","00:32,720","\"Yeah, I don't look or associate with soft spots.\""]
["00:32,720","00:37,120","\"If I see a fucking baby, I take a 360 and walk away.\""]
["00:37,120","00:41,280","\"You're fucking soft spot baby.\""]
["00:41,280","00:46,160","\"I'm gonna stick you in a car and let this heat take care of you.\""]
["00:46,160","00:48,000","\"Wait.\""]
["00:48,000","00:50,320","\"Yeah, we're good.\""]
["00:50,320","00:50,880","\"We're good.\""]
["00:50,880","00:53,280","\"So I leave now basically.\""]
["00:53,280","00:56,560","\"I have to go back to Riskey so I have to come all the way back here.\""]
["00:57,360","01:00,460","\"I could have just bought something that let me teleport to her quickly, but...\""]
["01:00,460","01:02,060","\"That's okay.\""]
["01:02,060","01:04,560","\"That's another thing you can do. There's this...\""]
["01:04,560","01:07,160","\"There's this power-up, right? That lets you, uh...\""]
["01:07,160","01:13,560","\"You basically can teleport to Risky Ship without having to go through the whole level.\""]
["01:13,560","01:15,560","\"- What the fuck is that? - It's really fucking important.\""]
["01:15,560","01:17,960","\"- That's Risky Ship. - You'll see.\""]
["01:17,960","01:21,160","\"- I wanna see now. - It's the pirate. I'm going there on the wrist.\""]

["01:23,560","01:25,560","\"- Hold on, hold your horses. - Oh, my God.\""]
["01:25,560","01:27,160","\"Why does it say \"\"hold your horses\"\"?\""]
["01:27,160","01:34,040","\"Because back when they were riding horses across the Oregon Trail, they get to a river\""]
["01:34,040","01:36,120","\"and say, \"\"Hold your horses!\"\"\""]
["01:36,120","01:37,120","\"Oh!\""]
["01:37,120","01:38,120","\"That makes sense.\""]
["01:38,120","01:39,120","\"I didn't make that up.\""]
["01:39,120","01:41,520","\"I don't know why they say that.\""]
["01:41,520","01:43,080","\"Oregon Trail is a good video game.\""]
["01:43,080","01:47,280","\"It was definitely the GTA 5 of its time.\""]

["01:50,120","01:53,120","\"I had a game called the Granny's Garden School and it freaked me out.\""]
["01:53,120","01:56,800","\"But I think it's because the teacher was lying about what was happening.\""]
["01:56,800","01:59,720","\"Wait, I need to get my item.\""]
["01:59,720","02:01,640","\"How do I use it?\""]
["02:01,640","02:05,920","\"Remember those max in schools that had like the multi-colors in the back?\""]
["02:05,920","02:08,920","\"Why did, like when I was in school, why did they all have max?\""]
["02:08,920","02:10,920","\"Nobody uses them.\""]
["02:10,920","02:14,920","\"I mean, use them until they got popular because of the iPod, right?\""]
["02:14,920","02:15,920","\"What's happening?\""]
["02:15,920","02:16,920","\"Is there?\""]
