["00:08,160","00:12,160","\"You'll be like, \"\"Hey, speak.\"\" And she'll go, \"\"Hoo!\"\"\""]
["00:12,160","00:14,840","\"\"\"I don't feel like it today!\"\"\""]
["00:14,840","00:16,000","\"But that's not speak.\""]
["00:16,000","00:17,360","\"That's wrong.\""]

["00:29,440","00:31,440","\"No, no!\""]
["00:31,440","00:34,840","\"Can't we just do basic division instead?\""]
["00:34,840","00:39,840","\"Do you like when the Simpson animals they go?\""]
["00:39,840","00:42,040","\"I do.\""]
["00:42,040","00:45,040","\"So like when they run down the street because of the elephant.\""]
["00:45,040","00:50,440","\"I and they peek back. They peek back up for a second. Yeah, it's cute. The Simpsons was so good.\""]
["00:50,440","00:53,040","\"Why did they ruin it?\""]
["00:53,040","00:57,160","\"I feel like you don't even have to say that. I feel like you don't have to say it was so good.\""]
["00:57,160","01:02,320","\"I feel like you can just say the Simpsons was good because no human being is going to think of anything beyond\""]
["01:02,320","01:04,720","\"The window where it was good\""]
["01:04,720","01:10,660","\"Really? I find it very hard not to. You think so? Anytime someone brings up the Simpsons\""]
["01:10,660","01:15,920","\"I just naturally assume they're talking about the old seasons typically. Well, you know like when they're talking about it\""]
["01:15,920","01:20,240","\"Yeah, but it's hard to separate how bad it got. Oh, no, it's easy to remember that\""]
["01:20,240","01:23,060","\"But I feel like anyone who's ever gonna have a discussion about it\""]
["01:23,060","01:26,760","\"You don't even have to really make like a statement. I think most people assume\""]
["01:26,760","01:33,440","\"I feel like it wasn't even gradual like it got bad really quickly. No, it did it was pretty it was pretty sudden\""]
["01:33,440","01:35,700","\"I think I've said it before but this the episode\""]
["01:35,700","01:39,840","\"I remember getting super super bad was when Marge starts repressed will stand\""]
["01:39,840","01:41,880","\"It was like season 10\""]
["01:41,880","01:43,240","\"See the season 11\""]
["01:43,240","01:49,360","\"I think when it was really like noticeable that just completely drop the quality season 9 was already getting\""]
["01:49,360","01:53,160","\"Lisa goes Gaga was specifically the one where I was like okay, I'm not gonna watch this\""]
["01:55,400","01:57,920","\"earlier than that but that was when I was literally like wow\""]
["01:57,920","02:03,920","\"I stopped after the worst thing I've ever seen I think I stopped at season 11 or season 12 with like a\""]
["02:03,920","02:09,800","\"Few occurrences of me watching it again, but yeah, I saw Lisa goes Gaga and that was when I decided like okay\""]
["02:09,800","02:12,940","\"I don't think I need to actively follow this\""]
["02:12,940","02:16,520","\"Station that I would make is that it's one thing to be like okay\""]
["02:16,520","02:21,240","\"Simpsons episodes are generally not as good as they used to be like you could sort of feel that yeah\""]
["02:21,240","02:26,360","\"But then the point where you're just like okay, I'm not even gonna bother trying to watch this and it hurts\""]
["02:26,360","02:27,640","\"It just makes you mad\""]
["02:27,640","02:34,400","\"The show feels like all it's trying to do at this point is set as many records as it can before the show gets canceled\""]
["02:34,400","02:40,760","\"They need to have the most destinations visited in an animated sitcom. They need to have the longest length for an animated sitcom\""]
["02:40,760","02:45,840","\"It just feels like that's the only reason it's still here anymore. Oh, it's weird\""]
["02:48,000","02:51,560","\"What is an episode that you very dearly love of the Simpsons? Oh\""]
["02:51,560","02:54,800","\"God there's a lot\""]
["02:54,800","03:02,880","\"I really like from season 4 up through season 6. That's my golden period. It was very funny\""]
["03:02,880","03:05,800","\"Yeah, during that period. I like all of them. They're all great. I\""]
["03:05,800","03:09,200","\"Know you don't like season one\""]
["03:09,200","03:11,520","\"It creeps me out. I like it\""]
["03:11,520","03:16,320","\"I would say it's a pretty I would say season one is a bit shaky\""]
["03:17,040","03:24,140","\"I like it for the reason that it's like it's very clear in its characters and yes intent\""]
["03:24,140","03:29,520","\"But it's it's a little bit boring to watch season one. I think season two is\""]
["03:29,520","03:34,520","\"Probably season two and three are my personal ideal because it's still like okay\""]
["03:34,520","03:38,120","\"dysfunctional family being like genuine\""]
["03:38,120","03:43,920","\"I would say half the end of season one you could at least be like entertained by yeah\""]
["03:44,000","03:50,460","\"Some of them are like there's like the camping episode. There's like the camping one is the one I can't actually watch sometimes\""]
["03:50,460","03:54,160","\"There's there's not anything that's another one that used to bore me from season one\""]
["03:54,160","04:00,400","\"I strive you're coming too. I can't remember. It's been a really long time. I'd say the camping one's probably the weakest of season one\""]
["04:00,400","04:06,320","\"I like the one when they they go to family therapy together that one is fun. I remember that one\""]
["04:06,320","04:12,860","\"About their characters and their personalities and how they interact the babysitter bandit was fun\""]
["04:12,860","04:17,860","\"I liked when they went to Mr. Burns's party and Marg drank.\""]
["04:17,860","04:20,380","\"- I do that, remember Marg used to have a try-\""]
["04:20,380","04:21,740","\"- He was driving this guy at the end of it.\""]
["04:21,740","04:23,900","\"- Everybody embarrassed Homer.\""]
["04:23,900","04:25,900","\"That's a thing that doesn't happen.\""]
["04:25,900","04:28,340","\"That was the only season where they could do that.\""]
["04:28,340","04:32,300","\"- I do enjoy the later seasons\""]
["04:32,300","04:34,820","\"where it was like not as much character driven\""]
["04:34,820","04:38,740","\"and it was comedy and just silly cartoon-y things happening.\""]
["04:38,740","04:42,340","\"- I like the one where Bart sees the guy,\""]
["04:42,340","04:44,440","\"Joe Quimby's cousin pushed the waiter.\""]
["04:44,440","04:45,340","\"- That is a good one.\""]
["04:45,340","04:46,340","\"- I love that one.\""]
["04:46,340","04:48,720","\"Oh, look at these guys.\""]
["04:48,720","04:51,000","\"- So was our premise for this one really just,\""]
["04:51,000","04:54,200","\"I need to forget about this now and it just ended?\""]
["04:54,200","04:57,080","\"- I don't even know what you're talking about.\""]
["04:57,080","04:58,680","\"- So the ghost is gone.\""]
["04:58,680","04:59,520","\"- The ghost is gone.\""]
["04:59,520","05:00,340","\"- No, he's right there.\""]
["05:00,340","05:01,180","\"- Oh, is he?\""]
["05:01,180","05:04,880","\"- So the ghost of Scars infecting the land.\""]
["05:04,880","05:07,400","\"- You're going forever, your majesty.\""]
["05:07,400","05:08,240","\"- Aw.\""]
["05:08,240","05:11,040","\"- You know, if Mickey heard you say that,\""]
["05:11,040","05:12,440","\"He'd be very disappointed.\""]
["05:12,440","05:14,140","\"I wish Sora would say that to me.\""]
["05:14,140","05:15,440","\"Your Majesty?\""]
["05:15,440","05:15,940","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:15,940","05:18,340","\"I forgot how much I like the Lion King, by the way.\""]
["05:18,340","05:19,740","\"I like this guy.\""]
["05:19,740","05:21,240","\"I like this guy a lot.\""]
["05:21,240","05:22,240","\"Oh!\""]
["05:22,240","05:23,740","\"He's a fun design.\""]
["05:23,740","05:26,740","\"Oh, no, that is disgusting.\""]
["05:26,740","05:29,240","\"Oh, you can only fight him with him.\""]
["05:29,240","05:31,240","\"Where are your stupid friends at?\""]
["05:31,240","05:33,240","\"It's not what I was expecting.\""]
["05:33,240","05:34,240","\"Whoa!\""]
["05:34,240","05:35,240","\"Oh my god!\""]
["05:35,240","05:36,240","\"Whoa!\""]
["05:36,240","05:37,240","\"Is there a monkey on his head?\""]
["05:37,240","05:38,240","\"There he is.\""]
["05:38,240","05:40,240","\"Now, that's not kind of a fight.\""]
["05:40,240","05:43,240","\"She put a monkey on their head and I'm down.\""]
["05:43,240","05:48,240","\"Fighting a big thing with fast movement like this seems like it'd be a lot of fun.\""]
["05:48,240","05:50,240","\"Yeah, that seems cool.\""]
["05:50,240","05:54,240","\"Uh, wow, you could have his head off.\""]
["05:54,240","05:57,240","\"Julian, more reason to be afraid of the little chisels.\""]
["05:57,240","05:58,240","\"How am I supposed to get up there?\""]
["05:58,240","06:04,240","\"Look at this guy.\""]
["06:04,240","06:08,240","\"I like that you have to climb up on top and it's just an underlying mask because it's so big.\""]
["06:08,240","06:13,240","\"I feel like youth ball was up here the whole time.\""]
["06:13,240","06:17,440","\"Most games, like there's a few like of course like Shadow of the Colossus and Zelda and\""]
["06:17,440","06:20,200","\"all that but a lot of games don't make use of scale.\""]
["06:20,200","06:22,240","\"Like huge huge monsters and shit.\""]
["06:22,240","06:23,240","\"It's true.\""]
["06:23,240","06:27,240","\"I feel like that should be easy because you just scale up a model.\""]
["06:27,240","06:31,800","\"Remember how we talked about earlier how clumsy it is to climb on stuff in these games sometimes?\""]
["06:31,800","06:32,800","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:32,800","06:33,800","\"That's why people don't do it.\""]
["06:33,800","06:37,960","\"You'd have to properly like set that up and everything to be able to climb on it without\""]
["06:37,960","06:40,160","\"being really finicky and awkward.\""]
["06:40,160","06:42,120","\"We should play Earth Defense for some time.\""]
["06:42,120","06:45,720","\"I really want to because those games look like so much fun to me.\""]
["06:45,720","06:46,960","\"I've never actually played one.\""]
["06:46,960","06:47,960","\"Me neither.\""]
["06:47,960","06:49,960","\"I've watched a lot of footage of it though.\""]
["06:49,960","06:51,640","\"One of my friends was obsessed with the one.\""]
["06:51,640","06:53,240","\"And I was watching him kill Giant Ants.\""]
["06:53,240","06:54,680","\"And it looked like a lot of fun.\""]
["06:54,680","06:56,080","\"It really does.\""]
["06:56,080","07:01,520","\"Fighting gigantic invading aliens with goofy physics\""]
["07:01,520","07:02,800","\"and special weapons and everything.\""]
["07:02,800","07:05,040","\"That seems like a great idea for a game.\""]
["07:05,040","07:06,320","\"I'd love to get into that.\""]
["07:06,320","07:08,920","\"Chris did you have any flip phone games?\""]
["07:08,920","07:11,360","\"Uh, flip phone games.\""]
["07:11,360","07:15,860","\"Like those old cell phones, the ones that were not so smart.\""]
["07:15,860","07:21,140","\"Uh, flip phone, like I never bought one if that's your mean.\""]
["07:21,140","07:22,460","\"I always got the ones that came with the phone.\""]
["07:22,460","07:24,460","\"I had one for a couple years or hasn't.\""]
["07:24,460","07:26,380","\"You said you had the metal slot one that I had.\""]
["07:26,380","07:27,860","\"I had the little metal slot game.\""]
["07:27,860","07:29,780","\"That ran at like three frames per second.\""]
["07:29,780","07:30,780","\"You couldn't play it.\""]
["07:30,780","07:31,780","\"Oh, I remember that.\""]
["07:31,780","07:34,620","\"Yeah, I had some like, I think back to things like that.\""]
["07:34,620","07:35,780","\"That's what I was talking about.\""]
["07:35,780","07:38,220","\"I remember the only game I ever wanted to get on the phone was...\""]
["07:38,220","07:39,220","\"I can't get to it.\""]
["07:39,220","07:42,380","\"I think it was called Final Fantasy 7 before Crisis.\""]
["07:42,380","07:44,620","\"It was a phone exclusive Final Fantasy game.\""]
["07:44,620","07:47,100","\"Isn't that where it's exploring the Turks?\""]
["07:47,100","07:48,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:48,100","07:49,620","\"I remember seeing stuff for that one.\""]
["07:49,620","07:52,060","\"I never actually got to see what the game was though.\""]
["07:52,060","07:53,060","\"I heard it wasn't good.\""]
["07:53,060","07:54,060","\"I believe it.\""]
["07:54,060","07:57,180","\"Crash of the Titans is a stupid, stupid game.\""]
["07:57,180","08:00,500","\"But I do remember that there's like a flip-thon version of it.\""]
["08:00,500","08:01,500","\"And it actually...\""]
["08:01,500","08:04,180","\"They redesigned him and it wasn't a bad redesign.\""]
["08:04,180","08:05,180","\"Really?\""]
["08:05,180","08:09,040","\"the pixel art in it wasn't that bad either I was kind of surprised the game\""]
["08:09,040","08:13,520","\"doesn't look like it's any good but it didn't look bad visually at least that's\""]
["08:13,520","08:16,780","\"my least favorite rendition of crash ever is that the one with the tribal\""]
["08:16,780","08:22,100","\"tattoos yeah and his voice is and then they say he's the voice actor for crash\""]
["08:22,100","08:26,200","\"now I think he's the worst voice of him ever I don't hate the tribal tattoos\""]
["08:26,200","08:31,460","\"themselves but the shape of his body is fucking ugly I hate him the way that\""]
["08:31,460","08:36,940","\"Or like they shaped his face. I don't like looking at it. So this thing was pretending to be a ghost\""]
["08:36,940","08:46,140","\"That's a cool that's a cool heart. I like that or was that actually scars heart. I assumed it was scar\""]
["08:46,140","08:47,240","\"I\""]
["08:47,240","08:50,060","\"Guess they don't really say from what I recall. Okay\""]
["08:50,060","08:55,100","\"I would have looser I would assume that was scar\""]
["08:55,100","08:58,540","\"Since a heart came out of it\""]
["08:58,540","09:09,160","\"the courage of those who fought beside him do you think a quest will ever be over no no I don't know\""]
["09:09,160","09:22,200","\"don't keep making sequels forever the final game is going to be really meta it's gonna zoom out and show the square employees feeding more memories in the\""]
["09:22,200","09:28,880","\"Sora's brain. He just hear him whimpering going \"\"no more, no more.\"\" A square\""]
["09:28,880","09:33,240","\"Enix building level would be fun. They would. Just to fight all the employees.\""]
["09:33,240","09:37,000","\"I know how about we make Sora's mother a nobody and his father a\""]
["09:37,000","09:41,800","\"the heartless. What? It's sort of just say no more.\""]
["09:41,800","09:48,960","\"I hope we never meet again.\""]
["09:48,960","09:56,960","\"Thank you big pig. You can be a big pick too.\""]
["09:56,960","09:58,960","\"Boy. Boy.\""]
["09:58,960","10:03,120","\"It's probably not going to turn back to normal.\""]
["10:03,120","10:04,720","\"Are they going to show me a logo?\""]
["10:04,720","10:06,400","\"Oh, there you go.\""]
["10:06,400","10:08,400","\"That's just beautiful.\""]
["10:08,400","10:13,400","\"And so Simba had lots of pride for his destroyed area.\""]
["10:13,400","10:14,400","\"Get that.\""]
["10:14,400","10:16,400","\"How do you feel about that Chris?\""]

["10:18,400","10:19,400","\"Oh no.\""]
["10:19,400","10:20,400","\"It's no good.\""]
["10:20,400","10:23,400","\"Did Rafiki draw those or did you go into his cave to draw those?\""]
["10:23,400","10:25,400","\"Yeah, you vandalized his sacred wall.\""]
["10:25,400","10:26,400","\"That was very cruel.\""]
["10:26,400","10:28,400","\"Do not vandalize.\""]
