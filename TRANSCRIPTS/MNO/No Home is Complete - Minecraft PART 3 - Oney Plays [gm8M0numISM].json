["02:55,120","03:00,160","\"Thought they were basically the same because of both wall, but it's not looks as white bed\""]
["03:00,160","03:05,100","\"Yeah, no, I clicked with the white bed just to make sure we got the format right? Yeah, we did\""]
["03:05,100","03:11,080","\"Yeah, we need them all to be the same color. That is so fucking lame. All right. We gotta go kill one\""]
["03:11,080","03:17,520","\"We gotta go get one more sheep. There's a sheenly. Oh, whoo-hoo. It looks like a pig. No, it is a sheep. I just need my fine sheep\""]

["03:23,680","03:24,520","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:24,520","03:26,960","\"- You need the white one. That's the important one.\""]
["03:26,960","03:28,880","\"- But we can make a gray one.\""]
["03:28,880","03:30,600","\"Look, that one gave me like three.\""]

["03:32,440","03:35,240","\"- Yeah, every little bit of wool you can find.\""]
["03:35,240","03:37,080","\"- There's so much freaking wool now.\""]
["03:37,080","03:40,520","\"It's kind of off-putting how much wool we have.\""]
["03:40,520","03:42,560","\"- It's kind of disgusted with myself.\""]
["03:42,560","03:43,880","\"- I'm gonna leave them alive.\""]
["03:45,760","03:48,020","\"I think you're finally starting to grow.\""]
["03:48,020","03:49,680","\"-As a person? -Yes.\""]
["03:49,680","03:51,360","\"-Is that my character arc?\""]
["03:51,360","03:55,880","\"-Yes. One day, Chris decided not to kill the sheep\""]
["03:55,880","03:58,080","\"that he could then come back later and harvest for--\""]
["03:58,080","04:00,120","\"-That is like a fable, it's a little fable.\""]
["04:00,120","04:03,520","\"-I do feel like it spings the value of delayed gratification.\""]
["04:03,520","04:06,080","\"-I think in my brain is that if I cannot kill something\""]
["04:06,080","04:08,560","\"in a video game, then I don't really want to play it.\""]
["04:08,560","04:11,360","\"I'm not clicking on things and watching them die.\""]
["04:11,360","04:14,720","\"-I feel like that's why AI dungeon resonated so well with you.\""]
["04:14,720","04:15,720","\"You can kill anything.\""]

["04:50,260","04:51,420","\"- Oh, we did it.\""]
["04:51,420","04:54,920","\"We finally did it.\""]
["04:54,920","04:56,220","\"We did the game.\""]
["04:56,220","04:57,300","\"So that's the end of the game now.\""]
["04:57,300","04:58,120","\"- I think you beat it.\""]
["04:58,120","04:58,960","\"Yeah, I think that was it.\""]
["04:58,960","05:00,500","\"- Unless you really want to build a sewage system.\""]
["05:00,500","05:01,820","\"- No, I think that was the point of Minecraft.\""]
["05:01,820","05:03,860","\"- You want to build a Roman aqueduct.\""]
["05:03,860","05:05,880","\"- Here, Tom will build a sewage system right now.\""]

["05:06,840","05:08,300","\"(mumbling)\""]
["05:08,300","05:10,020","\"- We're gonna make a sewage system next to the bed\""]
["05:10,020","05:11,620","\"so we can just like piss out of the bed.\""]
["05:11,620","05:17,940","\"Yeah, make a beautiful little bed bag. You can roll your fucking your penis over and pee down the hole\""]
