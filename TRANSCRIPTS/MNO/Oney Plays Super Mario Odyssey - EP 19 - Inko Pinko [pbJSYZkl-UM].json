["00:33,360","00:37,360","\"Why do they live outside of his house?\""]
["00:37,360","00:39,360","\"They've been following me.\""]
["00:39,360","00:41,360","\"They're trying to docks me.\""]
["00:41,360","00:43,360","\"This is really strange.\""]
["00:43,360","00:44,360","\"Crumbled then.\""]
["00:44,360","00:45,360","\"I like this a lot.\""]
["00:45,360","00:46,360","\"Julian, it's weird.\""]
["00:46,360","00:48,360","\"Is that not memorable because it's weird?\""]
["00:48,360","00:50,360","\"Uh, huh?\""]
["00:50,360","00:51,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:51,360","00:53,360","\"Let's see how it goes.\""]

["00:57,360","01:05,800","\"This is very strange. I like it. I love it. Where are we gonna fight? Are you gonna fight the dragon? That would be stu okay?\""]
["01:05,800","01:14,440","\"Oh, there he is. That would be stupicals. Look, he's the king. I like his little head waggle. Yeah, see it's Maleficent. This is really bizarre\""]
["01:14,440","01:23,920","\"This is really weird. I like it. Oh, what makes this difference different from fucking fighting Sephiroth with Donald Duck?\""]
["01:25,360","01:29,100","\"Why it's the opposite what it's the opposite?\""]
["01:29,100","01:34,920","\"Is it the opposite because you're fighting coolness with autism, but in Kingdom Hearts you're fighting autism with coolness\""]
["01:34,920","01:39,320","\"Cuz I could make the argument that everything you're doing in that game\""]
["01:39,320","01:46,720","\"I don't like to be able to crack in his skull. It was upsetting. I'm kidding by the way. That's not a real argument\""]
["01:46,720","01:54,400","\"Allow me to jump on your perfectly platformed head. Yeah, I just I just like it because it's so fucking outlandish\""]
["01:54,400","01:58,200","\"Okay, well that's fair enough because it is.\""]
["01:58,200","02:03,440","\"I think New Dog City is probably the closest thing to being this stylistically far.\""]
["02:03,440","02:04,440","\"Yes.\""]
["02:04,440","02:08,540","\"Every other level in this has been very, very like...\""]

["02:13,760","02:16,360","\"I wouldn't call it particularly daring or anything.\""]
["02:16,360","02:17,360","\"I see your point.\""]
["02:17,360","02:18,360","\"I just think it's cool.\""]
["02:18,360","02:21,400","\"Look, it's a big dragon and it's a little man.\""]
["02:21,400","02:22,640","\"What more could you want in a video?\""]
