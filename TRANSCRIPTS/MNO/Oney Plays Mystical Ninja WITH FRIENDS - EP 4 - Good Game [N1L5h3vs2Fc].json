["20:39,920","20:40,920","\"Do games?\""]
["20:40,920","20:42,920","\"You see the way that tree is symmetrical?\""]
["20:42,920","20:44,920","\"Yes, I was just thinking about that.\""]
["20:44,920","20:46,920","\"Do you think-- like, does that save space on the--\""]
["20:46,920","20:47,920","\"Yeah, probably.\""]
["20:47,920","20:48,920","\"Yeah, probably just drew it.\""]
["20:48,920","20:49,920","\"That's what half of it and had it flip it.\""]
["20:49,920","20:50,920","\"Mm.\""]
["20:50,920","20:53,700","\"They always do that because yeah, you don't want to have too much on screen.\""]
["20:53,700","20:55,040","\"These areas are really big too.\""]
["20:55,040","20:57,240","\"That's why, that's why Mario did it.\""]
["20:57,240","20:59,200","\"That's interesting.\""]
["20:59,200","21:00,400","\"It works.\""]
["21:00,400","21:02,040","\"It's the job done.\""]
["21:02,040","21:05,000","\"I'm supposed to go up to the copy shop.\""]
["21:05,000","21:06,680","\"What a gosh thing.\""]
["21:06,680","21:07,240","\"Heck is it?\""]
["21:07,240","21:09,240","\"I can't see this.\""]
["21:09,240","21:11,520","\"Get this tree out of here.\""]
["21:11,520","21:12,760","\"How do you think they're doing that?\""]
["21:12,760","21:16,680","\"Do you think they're like, that's actually one half that they're making.\""]
["21:16,680","21:18,920","\"Oh, no, no, no, no, those are.\""]
["21:19,280","21:22,080","\"It's a flat plane and it's always rotating itself.\""]
["21:22,080","21:22,580","\"Oh, I know that.\""]
["21:22,580","21:23,780","\"It's like Sonic Adventure 2.\""]
["21:23,780","21:24,680","\"Yeah, there is.\""]
["21:24,680","21:25,580","\"There is in two of them.\""]
["21:25,580","21:28,480","\"No, Sonic Adventure has two of them overlapping in this.\""]
["21:28,480","21:32,080","\"They have a plane and it's rotating to face the camera at all times.\""]
["21:32,080","21:32,880","\"Oh, you're right.\""]
["21:32,880","21:34,280","\"And it's called a billboard, right?\""]
["21:34,280","21:36,780","\"I didn't know there's a term for it.\""]
["21:36,780","21:37,880","\"I think it's called a billboard.\""]
["21:37,880","21:40,080","\"That's what these balls are doing, too.\""]
["21:40,080","21:41,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["21:41,080","21:42,880","\"It's just facing the camera.\""]
["21:42,880","21:45,380","\"Mario 64 did that with the bomb bomb guy.\""]
["21:45,380","21:46,680","\"The trees in Mario did it, too.\""]
["21:46,680","21:47,880","\"Yeah, you're right.\""]
["21:47,880","21:48,880","\"But uh...\""]
["21:48,880","21:51,680","\"But what I mean is that since the tree is symmetrical,\""]
["21:51,680","21:55,320","\"you think it's taking the info from only one side?\""]
["21:55,320","21:57,420","\"Or do you think it's just one big old sprite?\""]
["21:57,420","22:02,060","\"Oh, they for sure they did half of this and then they flipped it the other way.\""]
["22:02,060","22:02,860","\"Ah, okay.\""]
["22:02,860","22:05,060","\"Yeah, that makes more sense.\""]
["22:05,060","22:06,720","\"It was a safe space.\""]
["22:06,720","22:09,220","\"What it looks pretty good for Nintendo 64.\""]
["22:09,220","22:14,900","\"The N64 is really bad texture limits, so they for sure probably just put half of it in and flipped it.\""]
["22:14,900","22:16,900","\"These guys are fuckers.\""]
["22:18,600","22:20,600","\"Um, that's cool.\""]
["22:20,600","22:23,400","\"I like how Nintendo 64 games look in general.\""]
["22:23,400","22:28,040","\"You've always like go back to them and say they're really ugly, but there's like a charm to help.\""]
["22:28,040","22:29,240","\"Some of them look.\""]
["22:29,240","22:31,800","\"Especially this, like I like the idea of having balls for hair.\""]
["22:31,800","22:35,000","\"Was that game you showed me that? Oh, I think it was Mega Man.\""]
["22:35,000","22:36,600","\"Mega Man Legends looks great.\""]
["22:36,600","22:36,920","\"Yeah.\""]
["22:36,920","22:39,400","\"That still holds up visually just because they stylized it.\""]
["22:39,400","22:42,680","\"Like they had all the shadows in the bottom, but they were colored really well and stuff.\""]
["22:42,680","22:44,600","\"That game's pretty.\""]
["22:44,600","22:45,400","\"How are you looking for?\""]
["22:45,400","22:46,920","\"A way back up.\""]
["22:47,480","22:48,480","\"Here we go.\""]
["22:48,480","22:52,180","\"Cause I need to find a coffee shop and I'm being an idiot.\""]
