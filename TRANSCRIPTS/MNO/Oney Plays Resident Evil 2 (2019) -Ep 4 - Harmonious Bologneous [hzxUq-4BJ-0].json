["08:14,300","08:22,580","\"That's what makes if they were paying attention to him it wouldn't be funny\""]

["08:43,380","08:45,480","\"Yes, it is so fucking funny\""]
["08:45,480","08:52,220","\"It's because they so adamantly hate it like that fucking hated Freddy got finger. There's two you there's two Ebert reviews\""]
["08:52,220","08:56,540","\"I remember fondly it's the pulp fiction interview where he absolutely loved it\""]
["08:56,540","08:59,060","\"And then the Freddy got finger interview where he wanted to kill himself\""]
["08:59,060","09:07,860","\"Funny part is even in the future when he reviewed out\""]
["09:07,860","09:11,220","\"He was so he hated it so much he refused to even review it\""]
["09:11,220","09:14,060","\"Yeah, but it's not even dignified enough to even\""]
["09:14,060","09:17,620","\"Receive a review yeah, but in the future when there were really bad movies\""]
["09:17,620","09:20,580","\"He's like you know Freddy got finger was a terrible fucking piece of garbage\""]
["09:20,580","09:25,200","\"But I still remember it and he lost his jaw and who got the last laugh then I guess right?\""]
["09:25,200","09:28,780","\"That had nothing to do with the fucking movie Jeff\""]
["09:28,780","09:36,340","\"But he got he watched Freddy got finger and that's what increased your life. I will say I really got fingered through acid on his jaw\""]
["09:36,340","09:42,060","\"I hated Freddy got fingered, but then it's funny just core Corey turn me around though\""]
["09:42,060","09:50,620","\"It's funny the way Corey is lovingly explained to me. I'm like, you know what you're right\""]
["09:50,620","09:55,700","\"No, Jeff, you know that happens where you care about someone so much like you do for Corey, right?\""]
["09:55,700","10:00,500","\"Where they will actually warp your perception of something and make you enjoy something you otherwise would have hated\""]
["10:00,500","10:04,620","\"He had some good points though, but it's not just me all the time like like my friends\""]
["10:04,980","10:10,620","\"Will enjoy music I would fucking despise but then you see them enjoying it so much it makes you happy and then it makes you enjoy it\""]
["10:10,620","10:12,620","\"That's fair. Yeah, I\""]
["10:12,620","10:15,580","\"Think Freddy got fingered is is really a really bad movie\""]
["10:15,580","10:17,900","\"I don't think it's good as a movie\""]
["10:17,900","10:24,720","\"But as a stupid fucking flick that sucks and it has funny moments like you can't you can't deny that you can't sit through\""]
["10:24,720","10:26,720","\"Freddy got finger to end last no matter how\""]
