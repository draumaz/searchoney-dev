["05:19,540","05:21,460","\"Brave soul, who fears spiders?\""]
["05:21,460","05:23,220","\"Don't be scared of spiders.\""]
["05:23,220","05:24,180","\"Be brave.\""]
["05:24,180","05:30,580","\"I think I'm too old to not be afraid of spiders at this point.\""]
["05:30,580","05:34,820","\"Yeah. Sometimes I feel brave. Sometimes I still feel scared.\""]
["05:34,820","05:36,820","\"No, I can't. It's too scary.\""]
["05:36,820","05:43,740","\"I'm scared but shy. I'm shy of spiders. They make me nervous.\""]

["05:57,060","05:58,500","\"What's on over that?\""]
["05:58,500","06:01,060","\"But also, the first time I played this, I was like,\""]
["06:01,060","06:03,400","\"\"\"This looks like shit, what the fuck?\"\"\""]
["06:03,400","06:06,860","\"And then I played it and I was like, \"\"This plays like shit, what the fuck?\"\"\""]
["06:06,860","06:09,860","\"Oh, that slow roll, I might have to do something about that.\""]
["06:09,860","06:12,460","\"Oh, this literally plays just like Dark Souls.\""]
["06:12,460","06:13,660","\"Yeah, no, it's pretty similar.\""]
["06:13,660","06:16,540","\"Alright, I wanna try to parry him. First try, baby. Matthew Parry. Here we go.\""]
["06:16,540","06:18,300","\"I gotta kick him first.\""]
["06:18,300","06:21,360","\"You know, the first time I played this, um...\""]
["06:21,360","06:24,020","\"I just watched that really cool intro with the-\""]

["06:25,020","06:25,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:25,780","06:27,740","\"And I was like, \"\"I can't wait to be like that!\"\"\""]
["06:27,740","06:31,340","\"And then this started and it was all like slow and like,\""]
["06:31,340","06:35,440","\"you know, it's like really slow and I'm like, this is shit.\""]
["06:35,440","06:37,620","\"But then when I got to the first boss and beat it,\""]
["06:37,620","06:40,880","\"I was like, I feel like a fucking God right now.\""]
["06:40,880","06:42,740","\"All right, well, this gave me the quick roll.\""]
["06:42,740","06:44,580","\"I still got it's fat roll.\""]
["06:44,580","06:46,320","\"Kick off the pants, man.\""]
["06:46,320","06:47,160","\"All right.\""]
["06:47,160","06:51,300","\"- There we go, baby. - There we go.\""]
["06:51,300","06:53,660","\"Oh man, this is just like,\""]
["06:53,660","06:55,700","\"it's been a while since I played a soul's game.\""]
["06:55,700","06:57,360","\"I already feel like right at home.\""]
["06:57,360","07:03,440","\"My poor little Jakey. Tucks your shoes under the table. Feed you with my big wooden spoon\""]

["07:10,320","07:18,920","\"Scandalish Navy. It's like all the guys in the Navy, but they're scandalous. They're all like naked\""]
["07:18,920","07:24,960","\"Wow, Jake, you're pretty good at this. Can you do backstabs in this?\""]
["07:25,480","07:29,120","\"Yeah, if you get right behind him and just yeah given the old R1\""]
["07:29,120","07:33,940","\"I'm pretty sure certain things are worse just because it's the first of the series\""]
["07:33,940","07:39,720","\"Mmm, but and I'm sure there's still weapons that are crazy overpowered. Yeah, it works pretty good though. Oh\""]
["07:39,720","07:43,620","\"Come here girl. I\""]
["07:43,620","07:50,360","\"Actually like how these guys look to yeah, they look like monsters in the descent. I want to get another parry\""]
["07:50,360","07:52,360","\"It felt real good. Oh\""]
["07:53,080","07:54,280","\"You're a good boy.\""]
["07:54,280","07:57,900","\"Dude, the combat feels so good and this was like their first crack at it.\""]
["07:57,900","07:58,900","\"It's stupid.\""]
["07:58,900","08:02,140","\"Yeah, like this game is- I want to play this to the end.\""]
["08:02,140","08:05,840","\"How come all these fucking geniuses are called Miyazaki, huh?\""]
["08:05,840","08:06,340","\"I know.\""]
["08:06,340","08:06,900","\"What's this?\""]
["08:06,900","08:08,260","\"What's the sitch with that?\""]
["08:08,260","08:12,900","\"Oh yeah, um, in this there's no \"\"S\"\" this flash so you need to eat grass.\""]
["08:12,900","08:13,940","\"[laughs]\""]
["08:13,940","08:15,900","\"I'm like a dog trying to throw up.\""]

["08:18,220","08:20,700","\"I got my ear lobe, uh, removed.\""]
["08:20,700","08:22,660","\"You got your ear lobe removed?\""]
["08:22,660","08:25,540","\"Yeah. Are you memeing right now or did that happen?\""]
["08:25,540","08:27,220","\"No, it happened.\""]
["08:27,220","08:29,780","\"Like, wait, you're low, like the part that gets pierced?\""]
["08:29,780","08:32,020","\"Yeah. Why? What happened?\""]
["08:32,020","08:33,700","\"I just thought it looked stupid.\""]
["08:33,700","08:35,220","\"[Laughs]\""]
["08:35,220","08:37,860","\"Wait, really? I'm looking over at you. That's not...\""]
["08:37,860","08:38,820","\"[Laughs]\""]
["08:38,820","08:40,020","\"That's not a thing.\""]
["08:40,020","08:42,340","\"I'm really gullible. You're gonna learn that.\""]
["08:42,340","08:43,300","\"Aww.\""]
["08:43,300","08:44,180","\"Poor little fellow.\""]
["08:44,180","08:45,060","\"Oh, I eat the grass.\""]
["08:45,060","08:45,380","\"Roll through a lot.\""]
["08:45,380","08:46,660","\"Roll through a belly makes you throw up.\""]
["08:46,660","08:48,420","\"Uh...\""]
["08:48,420","08:50,420","\"I want to try to actually do this special parry move,\""]
["08:50,420","08:52,100","\"because I just keep hitting them with the R2\""]
["08:52,100","08:57,860","\"once I get the parry. Once I get the Matthew parry. I love these guys breath sound. Listen to that.\""]
["08:57,860","09:08,500","\"Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You get a super cool. Like the camera gets all open. I thought they all do\""]
["09:08,500","09:13,780","\"that. No. In Dark Souls the camera doesn't do that. It stays in like one place I'm pretty sure.\""]
["09:13,780","09:18,500","\"Or it's not as exaggerated. I like that a lot though. Which in was it Dark Souls 2 or 3 they\""]
["09:18,500","09:20,500","\"They took away the rag doll.\""]
["09:20,500","09:23,500","\"I think it might be two because I'm pretty sure it's in three.\""]
["09:23,500","09:26,500","\"They get fling stuff around because you can do it in Bloodborne.\""]
["09:26,500","09:28,500","\"I kind of wish they just leave it alone.\""]
["09:28,500","09:32,500","\"That's like a thing that objectively makes it look stupid, but it's hilarious.\""]
["09:32,500","09:34,500","\"Yeah, no one's gonna get mad about it.\""]
["09:34,500","09:36,500","\"Oh, nice try.\""]
["09:36,500","09:39,500","\"Wow, you're pretty good with a slinger.\""]
["09:39,500","09:41,500","\"What's your name, kid?\""]

["10:05,500","10:07,500","\"No, it's not a thing.\""]
