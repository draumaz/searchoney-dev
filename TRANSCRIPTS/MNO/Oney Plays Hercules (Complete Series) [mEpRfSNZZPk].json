["04:50,080","04:57,020","\"You've killed those birds. That's actually really satisfying just to look at lightning those birds to death\""]
["04:57,020","04:59,020","\"Yeah, they're made out of glasses\""]
["04:59,020","05:02,480","\"The background I mean I was gonna say\""]
["05:02,480","05:05,980","\"What are the things what a hook is movie is the colors?\""]
["05:05,980","05:09,500","\"I think the colors this came up pretty good to this game looks really fucking good\""]
["05:09,500","05:13,480","\"Right about this play good or it's a little slow. It's a little\""]
["05:13,480","05:19,160","\"Yeah, well a lot of the time like game animations the smoother they look actually\""]
["05:19,160","05:25,260","\"Less good they are for you can't I mean what yeah, there's gotta be some sort of some sort of\""]
["05:25,260","05:30,460","\"Formula for like if something yeah, this is well to a well-animated. You can't be that response for a quick, right?\""]
["05:30,460","05:32,220","\"Yeah for something to actually play good\""]
["05:32,220","05:37,660","\"Usually the transition should be less than if you break down like fighting game animations and stuff like that\""]
["05:37,660","05:41,020","\"Like usually it's like one frame. Yeah, usually there's one frame\""]
["05:41,020","05:45,620","\"Like what it from going from like completely still standing position to like\""]
["05:45,620","05:51,900","\"I was too. I mean, it seems like a special thing right there, but it's still pretty satisfying watching to do it\""]
["05:51,900","05:54,220","\"I like it. You know that can be sped up a tiny bit\""]
["05:54,220","06:00,180","\"In my little opinion some fucking poor guy slaved on this and you're\""]
["06:00,180","06:06,780","\"What I'm gonna say cut frames of that say I'm not saying a roofer was a saying cut them down from twos to ones\""]
["06:06,980","06:11,380","\"How much was the head of the same fucking Disney game you're talking about cutting people\""]
["06:11,380","06:16,740","\"Assholes accurate you are you've gone mad these guys aren't even on the same fucking plane is me\""]
["06:16,740","06:19,860","\"This isn't fair last by soul. Why is that a role?\""]

["06:29,420","06:34,460","\"Oh fuck how come you can't do that to the birds? How can we can't do it?\""]
["06:35,100","06:40,940","\"I think you can it's just probably not advice. There's a glitch of this game where that guy works in the day to veto himself\""]
["06:40,940","06:47,940","\"It's true. It's real at the end of this level. He makes Hercules uses super strength to tear the head off an elk\""]
["06:47,940","06:52,580","\"Down it's really uncomfortable. I would love to see someone do that\""]
["06:52,580","06:57,260","\"I would love that I love the always say to Philadelphia for that would be just they character ripping the head off an animal\""]
["06:57,260","06:59,860","\"I was oh my god. We can't we can't really\""]

["07:09,740","07:14,840","\"It was one of the first times I ever watched the show and it was the episode where Charlie Dave bites the nose off of Santa Claus\""]
["07:14,840","07:16,740","\"That was my first experience\""]
["07:16,740","07:21,500","\"I think was this what you is this because I think I remember a point where you hated that show because based off the Christmas episode\""]
["07:21,500","07:22,300","\"It was that one\""]
["07:22,300","07:26,280","\"You know because I was like how do people fucking like this show if the main characters biting the noses off\""]
["07:26,280","07:32,120","\"Yeah, that Christmas episode is ridiculous that I think I think season four like four and five in the show\""]
["07:32,120","07:36,360","\"We're like perfect comedy TV. Yeah, I think six and seven or whatever it would be on a great\""]
["07:36,360","07:41,400","\"But I think four and five are probably literally just perfect. Yeah. No, I love that show. It's great\""]
["07:41,400","07:47,920","\"Actually, no, the first time I watched it was with my friend and it was the Jersey Shore episode then after that it was the\""]
["07:47,920","07:53,160","\"Nose up. It just seems like they have a lot of fun with it, which is always a good quality\""]
["07:53,160","07:57,800","\"They actually they actually just do stupid shit like the guy who plays fucking Mac when he was just like dude\""]
["07:57,800","07:59,800","\"We should all get fat for a season never\""]
["07:59,800","08:02,820","\"And then he was like I'm gonna do it anyway fuck you guys\""]
["08:02,820","08:08,080","\"I read this yesterday that they asked a video get ripped for the season\""]
["08:08,080","08:12,380","\"He was like I'm not gonna do that really yesterday video get fucking Jack for the season\""]
["08:12,380","08:18,400","\"It was like 73 I can't it would've been funny, but that would have been amazing. I love that\""]
["08:18,400","08:20,400","\"He would look scary like that. He'd be horrible\""]
["08:21,440","08:26,320","\"Also like I don't know if you're Danny DeVito and you go your whole life looking like that\""]
["08:26,320","08:30,520","\"And then you get in the best shape of your life at like 70 something for a joke\""]
["08:30,520","08:31,880","\"Yeah\""]
["08:31,880","08:37,160","\"That would fuck with your psychology somehow I would assume it's also sort of see people are sort of laughing at him\""]
["08:37,160","08:39,680","\"Because it's like you look stupid fucking bump to a degree\""]
["08:39,680","08:43,040","\"I'd get not wanting to be like ripped as a as a gag\""]
["08:43,040","08:46,480","\"Yeah, we're doing for help at the same time. It would be really fucking funny\""]
["08:46,480","08:50,480","\"If he ever gets like fucking out it as a piece of shit\""]
["08:50,480","08:56,620","\"I'm gonna be very sad. I will be really depressed if that happens cuz I love my Hercules. I love mintilda\""]
["08:56,620","09:01,300","\"And I love him in that show. He's a great actor. God damn it. That's your day to be a sweaty attack\""]
["09:01,300","09:08,800","\"You see a rectus fucking show you pussy I fucking hate these birds\""]
["09:08,800","09:12,320","\"You've done it\""]
["09:12,320","09:19,060","\"Huzzah, thanks, man. Oh, he really gets into the mind of Hercules, you know, what's he thinking right now?\""]
["09:19,060","09:21,060","\"I\""]
["09:21,060","09:26,040","\"Actually if I was him the first thing I would be thinking about is just can I get away with killing people?\""]
["09:26,040","09:29,900","\"Could he's killed like giant the serpents. Yeah, I\""]
["09:29,900","09:36,000","\"Mean I guess who would bring him in right that would make him more of an interesting character if he took over like a\""]
["09:36,000","09:38,940","\"City and just held everyone hostage liquid super big killed somebody\""]
["09:38,940","09:42,180","\"There's that whole fucking story, you know the injustice\""]

["09:46,320","09:48,120","\"Why didn't they make that into a movie right?\""]
["09:48,120","09:53,000","\"Superman's the bad guy you know what you know what they should do it. Did you see the new fucking?\""]
["09:53,000","09:55,480","\"Teen Titans live action trailer\""]
["09:55,480","10:02,360","\"Yeah, that's why they should do something dog they fucking stinking it. Yeah, no no no\""]
["10:02,360","10:08,280","\"But that game is like like it's dark, but it's like it's still in that comic-kind of aesthetic. I would not do that\""]
["10:08,280","10:10,500","\"Well, I don't think I mean try it for God's sake\""]
["10:10,500","10:15,400","\"I guess they really managed to fuck up and knew an interesting ways constantly over there\""]
["10:17,240","10:20,480","\"Dude I even even even fucking\""]
["10:20,480","10:28,000","\"Batman v super was supposed to be dark and it just stuck. Yeah, Batman v Superman is genuinely one of the worst fucking movies\""]
["10:28,000","10:30,520","\"I've ever seen my entire life. I agree with you\""]
["10:30,520","10:34,580","\"I go so far as to say all those movies are supposed to be dark and edgy even fucking\""]
["10:34,580","10:39,680","\"I think Batman vs. Superman's a really good movie to watch in the background\""]
["10:39,680","10:45,620","\"I would I would recommend that movie to people is like a so bad. It's good movie if it was a fucking hour shorter\""]
["10:45,620","10:50,260","\"Yeah, it was an hour shorter. There's their shit like that is like oh, yeah\""]
