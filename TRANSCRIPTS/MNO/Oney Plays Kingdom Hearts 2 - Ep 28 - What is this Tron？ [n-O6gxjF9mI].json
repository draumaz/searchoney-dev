["00:10,800","00:13,600","\"You know what the weird thing about Advent Children is?\""]
["00:13,600","00:18,720","\"I thought at the very least, all of the choreography and fighting was really good,\""]
["00:18,720","00:20,720","\"but going back to watch it, it's not even that great.\""]
["00:20,720","00:22,560","\"It's kind of a mess to watch.\""]
["00:22,560","00:25,440","\"I didn't have a bad time.\""]
["00:25,440","00:26,960","\"No, it's funny.\""]
["00:26,960","00:29,600","\"We all got together to watch the...\""]
["00:29,600","00:31,600","\"To watch our ventilator out\""]
["00:31,600","00:37,000","\"We got together to watch it like what like a year ago. I want to say yeah\""]
["00:37,000","00:40,080","\"It's so fucking long though\""]
["00:40,080","00:42,560","\"Are you gonna res another bike?\""]
["00:42,560","00:44,640","\"Res it?\""]
["00:44,640","00:46,960","\"Res your bike Julian\""]
["00:46,960","00:51,040","\"This is the fun part don't screw it up okay\""]
["00:51,040","00:53,600","\"angry\""]
["00:55,560","01:01,560","\"This isn't how it happens. You're supposed to be making a big stupid trail. I don't remember this scene in the movie\""]
["01:01,560","01:05,060","\"It's a stupid this sucks. There were no kids in Tron\""]
["01:05,060","01:09,560","\"That was so epic. When are you going to actually have fun?\""]
["01:09,560","01:15,360","\"This is cool now now that the heartless died. I like this. What the age is that even a virus?\""]
["01:15,360","01:17,360","\"That's a dark zapper\""]
["01:17,360","01:19,960","\"Is that Melissa?\""]
["01:19,960","01:21,160","\"That's Melissa\""]
["01:21,960","01:24,120","\"- Who's Melissa, Chris?\""]
["01:24,120","01:25,520","\"- So computer virus.\""]
["01:25,520","01:26,720","\"- She explained it all.\""]
["01:26,720","01:29,840","\"- Is that the computer virus, Melissa?\""]
["01:29,840","01:31,760","\"- Actually, I never looked it up to see if that was real.\""]
["01:31,760","01:34,040","\"I think I just believed something at a very young age.\""]
["01:34,040","01:34,860","\"- What?\""]
["01:34,860","01:37,160","\"- That's what we have to tell the story.\""]
["01:37,160","01:38,880","\"- We used to talk about computer viruses\""]
["01:38,880","01:39,880","\"'cause they were cool.\""]
["01:39,880","01:41,040","\"- And there was one called Melissa.\""]
["01:41,040","01:42,440","\"- There was one called the Melissa virus\""]
["01:42,440","01:44,400","\"where every, like, I think it was actually\""]
["01:44,400","01:45,960","\"the same exact idea.\""]
["01:45,960","01:47,800","\"People talked about the I love you virus\""]
["01:47,800","01:50,720","\"where everything you typed in said I love you.\""]
["01:50,720","01:51,720","\"That's probably wrong.\""]
["01:51,720","01:52,920","\"But then people also said to say that--\""]
["01:52,920","01:54,680","\"- Well yeah, that's what, the thing is with that,\""]
["01:54,680","01:56,320","\"that is wrong, but at the same time,\""]
["01:56,320","01:58,000","\"that's how the story got spread around.\""]
["01:58,000","02:00,280","\"People made that virus into something that wasn't.\""]
["02:00,280","02:01,120","\"- Yeah.\""]
["02:01,120","02:02,680","\"- Didn't like backseat Outlook or something,\""]
["02:02,680","02:04,920","\"and it would just spread itself around through that.\""]
["02:04,920","02:06,160","\"- I'm not sure.\""]
["02:06,160","02:08,480","\"- But yeah, I remember people mixed that virus up\""]
["02:08,480","02:10,440","\"with a lot of things, and kids would just make up\""]
["02:10,440","02:11,640","\"rumors about viruses that make sense.\""]
["02:11,640","02:12,920","\"- But that's what we thought the Melissa,\""]
["02:12,920","02:15,240","\"and I love you, Virus was where everything you typed in\""]
["02:15,240","02:17,040","\"was either Melissa or I loved you.\""]
["02:17,040","02:18,720","\"But I know there was a virus that used to literally\""]
["02:18,720","02:20,160","\"beat the shit out of your CD drive,\""]
["02:20,160","02:22,980","\"and ruin your computer from the inside physically.\""]
["02:22,980","02:24,380","\"- I know there's a lot like that,\""]
["02:24,380","02:26,260","\"that they would just throttle your hardware,\""]
["02:26,260","02:28,700","\"trying to just burn everything out internally.\""]
["02:28,700","02:31,580","\"- You don't really hear anything like that anymore, huh?\""]
["02:31,580","02:33,420","\"- It's 'cause nothing's really vulnerable\""]
["02:33,420","02:35,460","\"to such a degree anymore.\""]
["02:35,460","02:38,900","\"- Back then, anything was vulnerable.\""]
["02:38,900","02:41,700","\"You could open Outlook, you could open an image file.\""]
["02:41,700","02:45,060","\"Pretty much everything could be taken advantage of in some way.\""]
["02:45,060","02:47,540","\"- What was the worst virus you ever had?\""]
["02:47,540","02:51,700","\"I remember my mom downloaded a Valentine's theme\""]
["02:51,700","02:52,540","\"for the computer.\""]
["02:52,540","02:53,860","\"- Oh, you told me about that one.\""]
["02:53,860","02:54,700","\"- I remember.\""]
["02:54,700","02:56,940","\"- We started getting pop up viruses for porn everywhere\""]
["02:56,940","03:01,820","\"constantly on top of a, I downloaded Comic Percer.\""]
["03:01,820","03:03,940","\"I downloaded a Bonzi Buddy,\""]
["03:03,940","03:05,580","\"'cause I kept seeing ads for it.\""]
["03:05,580","03:08,620","\"- I had some, yeah, I told you about the little monkeys\""]
["03:08,620","03:10,460","\"that fucked up my desktop.\""]
["03:10,460","03:11,740","\"- What were they called?\""]
["03:11,740","03:13,140","\"- The Bloodhound gang.\""]
["03:13,140","03:14,260","\"- Oh, that.\""]
["03:14,260","03:15,540","\"You made it sound more exciting.\""]
["03:15,540","03:17,220","\"Is he called it the little monkeys?\""]
["03:17,220","03:18,900","\"- Yeah, like they were hopping around.\""]
["03:18,900","03:20,060","\"- They were dressed as little monkeys.\""]
["03:20,060","03:21,380","\"- I know, but it's the bloodhound gang,\""]
["03:21,380","03:22,460","\"that's the music video.\""]
["03:22,460","03:24,140","\"- Yeah, exactly.\""]
["03:24,140","03:25,980","\"You could say the people dressed as monkeys\""]
["03:25,980","03:27,940","\"as opposed to the little monkeys.\""]
["03:27,940","03:30,580","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:30,580","03:35,580","\"- But the worst virus I ever got was from porn, I guess.\""]
["03:35,580","03:37,380","\"- I guess.\""]
["03:37,380","03:40,300","\"- I can't remember, but it was this thing\""]
["03:40,300","03:42,420","\"that popped up every 10 minutes.\""]
["03:42,420","03:45,620","\"Every 10 minutes, and a woman would hold her ass\""]
["03:45,620","03:46,940","\"with her asshole on the screen\""]
["03:46,940","03:49,460","\"and try to connect this to some weird server.\""]
["03:49,460","03:50,860","\"And we could not get rid of it.\""]
["03:50,860","03:53,980","\"So we had to get a guy over to wipe our computer clean\""]
["03:53,980","03:57,060","\"and start a new, start life anew.\""]
["03:57,060","03:59,940","\"But I think I had that happen every 10 minutes,\""]
["03:59,940","04:01,580","\"literally for like a year.\""]
["04:01,580","04:04,540","\"And I just clicked out of it every single time.\""]
["04:04,540","04:07,100","\"- So Chris, he tells you that he fixed your computer\""]
["04:07,100","04:09,020","\"and you go, oh, thank goodness.\""]
["04:09,020","04:10,940","\"And then you look at him.\""]
["04:10,940","04:13,460","\"And inside of his eyeball is a little pop-up\""]
["04:13,460","04:15,580","\"that just appeared for the same time.\""]
["04:15,580","04:18,180","\"So his own vision is now being hijacked by the virus.\""]
["04:18,180","04:19,620","\"He took it out of the computer.\""]
["04:19,620","04:22,100","\"And then he took it on as a personal burden.\""]
["04:22,100","04:24,060","\"As a personal burden for all eternity.\""]
["04:24,060","04:26,980","\"Yeah. He's been cursed now by the computer.\""]
["04:26,980","04:29,060","\"He sacrificed himself for you.\""]
["04:29,060","04:30,140","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:30,140","04:31,340","\"But I paid him $20.\""]
["04:31,340","04:33,020","\"Would you tip a mxtra?\""]
["04:33,020","04:33,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:33,860","04:35,140","\"Like $5.\""]
["04:35,140","04:36,140","\"$5?\""]
["04:36,140","04:37,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:37,020","04:38,420","\"What's the percentage?\""]
["04:38,420","04:40,300","\"Is that 20%?\""]
["04:40,300","04:42,420","\"Chris, it's a lifelong sacrifice.\""]
["04:42,420","04:44,420","\"I didn't ask him to do it.\""]
["04:44,420","04:45,260","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:45,260","04:50,380","\"He he wingset you after he does everything okay, then another $5 for every wink\""]
["04:50,380","04:58,700","\"To give it to him okay, I'm glad you're true to your word Chris\""]
["04:58,700","05:02,460","\"This is Tron\""]
["05:02,460","05:06,900","\"What is this Tron\""]
["05:06,900","05:13,900","\"How did they play hack dot dot hack hacks a bunch of hacks\""]
["05:13,900","05:14,900","\"Max.\""]

["05:15,900","05:21,820","\"My favorite episode of any show ever was freakin' soy is in the computer.\""]
["05:21,820","05:22,820","\"Is that an episode?\""]
["05:22,820","05:23,820","\"That happened in a few episodes, Chris.\""]
["05:23,820","05:28,100","\"That was my favorite one though.\""]
["05:28,100","05:29,100","\"You have to enter the password.\""]
["05:29,100","05:32,380","\"There was an episode of freakin' soy gets stuck in a game and he's trying to find a\""]

["05:45,180","05:48,880","\"Wait, we really screwed up trusting him.\""]
["05:48,880","05:51,380","\"He's hacking the player, Sora.\""]
["05:51,380","05:53,880","\"It wasn't supposed to go this far.\""]
["05:53,880","05:55,080","\"[Laughter]\""]

["15:11,500","15:14,500","\"I would worry that it's going to happen with something else.\""]

["15:18,500","15:19,500","\"I wouldn't like that.\""]
["15:19,500","15:21,500","\"And they pulled a worm out of you.\""]

["17:03,200","17:07,440","\"And I noticed that it was only when I slept on my back, so I haven't slept on my back since.\""]
["17:07,440","17:11,440","\"I really wonder, I'm curious what the explanation for that is, like why?\""]
["17:11,440","17:15,200","\"Why it would be when you're only in a certain position and after a certain period of time.\""]
["17:15,200","17:19,120","\"I think it's something to do with when you lie on your back, your brain is like,\""]
