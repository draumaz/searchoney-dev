["00:04,400","00:05,600","\"With Fred and...\""]
["00:05,600","00:08,000","\"Crush Bandicoot shouldn't use an analog stick.\""]
["00:08,000","00:09,600","\"You're right, you should use a d-pad.\""]
["00:09,600","00:11,600","\"Remind me what the difference is again.\""]
["00:11,600","00:12,600","\"What do you mean?\""]
["00:12,600","00:15,000","\"Between analog and digital.\""]
["00:15,000","00:17,600","\"Uh, you can go in any direction you want with analog.\""]
["00:17,600","00:19,600","\"D-pad, you can only go in 8 directions.\""]
["00:19,600","00:22,600","\"And with analog, you can choose how fast you want to go.\""]
["00:22,600","00:23,600","\"Yeah, you can do this.\""]
["00:23,600","00:24,600","\"Yeah, you can make them do a little...\""]
["00:24,600","00:25,200","\"Isn't that good then?\""]
["00:25,200","00:26,600","\"A little sassy walk?\""]
["00:26,600","00:27,600","\"Isn't that better?\""]
["00:27,600","00:35,600","\"Well old crash games were designed around the fact it was a d-pad because there's always precise angles for everything and it had to be because it was only a d-pad at the time.\""]
["00:35,600","00:41,600","\"Oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh. You push the fucking you push this button but he only does it sometimes.\""]
["00:41,600","00:47,600","\"Why is it that button not the what I heard. It's the fucking GameCube! Yeah but it could be the triggers.\""]
["00:47,600","00:51,600","\"Don't we say that word? Why? Because it rhymes with the other one.\""]
["00:51,600","00:55,600","\"I miss only triggers. Why won't they come back?\""]
["00:55,600","00:57,600","\"They only made one comment.\""]
["00:57,600","00:59,600","\"What was the comment?\""]
["00:59,600","01:01,600","\"What was the comment about?\""]
["01:01,600","01:06,600","\"It was about how they got scared because Crash was walking towards the screen.\""]
["01:06,600","01:08,600","\"Oh, that's pretty scary. That's pretty funny.\""]
["01:08,600","01:12,600","\"He doesn't do it have the time because of the frame rate that's dropping.\""]
["01:12,600","01:14,600","\"Oh, you think that's why? Yeah, it's probably empty.\""]
["01:14,600","01:17,600","\"But most games have like, it stores it in a bank until or something.\""]
["01:17,600","01:20,600","\"It depends on how they're coded.\""]
["01:20,600","01:22,600","\"Most games do that though, right?\""]
["01:22,600","01:26,080","\"This game has frame skipping so it can actually handle your input anyways.\""]
["01:26,080","01:27,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:27,080","01:29,680","\"And also slow down like this doesn't actually slow the game down.\""]
["01:29,680","01:31,800","\"Yeah, it's making it go slow, Mo.\""]
["01:31,800","01:32,800","\"What?\""]
["01:32,800","01:33,800","\"What, Julie?\""]
["01:33,800","01:34,800","\"Look at this.\""]
["01:34,800","01:35,800","\"I said it's the worst explosion I've ever seen.\""]
["01:35,800","01:36,800","\"I told you, even...\""]
["01:36,800","01:39,240","\"I swear to God, even as a little kid, that really disappointed me.\""]
["01:39,240","01:43,240","\"Because everything had a lot of weight and punch to it in the old yuns.\""]
["01:43,240","01:45,240","\"All the effects were really nice.\""]
["01:45,240","01:48,120","\"It's just music.\""]
["01:48,120","01:49,920","\"Not satisfying, I'll tell you that.\""]
["01:49,920","01:51,920","\"Oh, that's the inventibility.\""]
["01:51,920","01:56,120","\"For some reason yeah, I thought it was like dangers. I don't know why they\""]
["01:56,120","02:00,700","\"You're getting chased down by fucking a psycho. I'm hitting jump\""]
["02:00,700","02:06,220","\"Yeah, I know you have to let go of it. What I jump so\""]
["02:06,220","02:11,980","\"Okay, yeah, you hit crouch and then you jump well if you skid you can do the jump\""]
["02:11,980","02:19,040","\"That's so weird though. Why is it set up that way the whole points that you crouch and then hit jump not you hold crouch\""]
["02:19,040","02:22,680","\"for a little bit then let go of crouch then hit jump surprise I forgot about\""]
["02:22,680","02:31,520","\"that look at the funny mask he say he say he say he say mmm look the\""]
["02:31,520","02:35,120","\"time right it's great hey Chris oh no it isn't see now who's being great she\""]
["02:35,120","02:39,440","\"what would you do if a mask started following you around would you get\""]
["02:39,440","02:42,320","\"scared because you knew danger was coming every morning you woke up you\""]
["02:42,320","02:48,400","\"went who do you can do that now I was scared I wasn't gonna even land on it\""]
["02:48,400","02:50,400","\"I\""]
["02:50,400","02:57,180","\"Don't care for this music. I'm sitting down Julian stop. He's so negative all the time all you ever are is negative\""]

["03:01,340","03:05,900","\"Fix the camera fix the camera. Thank you. There we go\""]
["03:05,900","03:12,420","\"Once you run out of shitty things to say maybe we'll have nice things to say. No, if you hit wall you go bouncing off of it\""]
["03:12,420","03:13,700","\"Yeah, oh\""]
["03:13,700","03:15,700","\"It's crazy\""]
["03:16,900","03:19,580","\"Make him come to a stop just let like of the analog stick\""]
["03:19,580","03:23,580","\"Looking at look at his dance. It looks stupid. Get his little\""]
["03:23,580","03:32,160","\"Little soft shoe stop making crash do stupid thing. It's funny though. No, he's a cartoon man. He's supposed to be funny. No\""]

["07:49,040","07:51,040","\"You didn't do it in that time anyway.\""]
["07:51,040","07:54,040","\"It just means that you went out of your way to break a box.\""]
