["00:42,840","00:44,360","\"the music is actually amazing.\""]
["00:44,360","00:47,560","\"And the one thing that's sad is that the music hasn't been saved or preserved\""]
["00:47,560","00:50,280","\"anywhere. People are piecing it together by ripping bits out of the show.\""]
["00:50,280","00:51,480","\"Oh, it's a joy-pendant.\""]
["00:51,480","00:53,080","\"That's really sad.\""]
["00:53,080","00:53,960","\"Dang it. It is.\""]
["00:53,960","00:56,440","\"I hate it when things aren't preserved.\""]
["00:56,440","01:00,040","\"I could just I hope it's out there someday and somebody just finds it up\""]

["01:04,440","01:06,840","\"I hate when shows aren't preserved like\""]
["01:06,840","01:09,900","\"You're looking for a show that you want to watch again\""]
["01:09,900","01:14,880","\"But there's like no movies or it's not on like BHS or anything because that wasn't even really a fucking thing at the time\""]

["01:26,340","01:30,820","\"Yeah, that's like rare. I guess that's one of those things and it's not rare\""]
["01:30,820","01:33,700","\"You know, it's kind of like I know it's weird now\""]
["01:33,700","01:39,420","\"But and now it doesn't really matter because it's all been uploaded like individually, but you know shows like X-Play\""]
["01:39,420","01:46,400","\"Yeah, that's the old setup where you could watch a whole episode of X-Play and just being instead of just being individual reviews\""]
["01:46,400","01:52,720","\"You can watch all like fucking millions all excuse me like the whole thing. They had like the skits really creators at the office and stuff like that\""]
["01:52,720","01:57,900","\"Yeah, those don't exist so you can't watch explain. It's like prime and I remember like there's a few anywhere\""]

["05:46,880","05:51,100","\"Can you get a quiver that makes the women shiver\""]
["05:51,100","05:59,480","\"Recently to town I don't know if they should I think they might have like I think people preserved it because this is always happens\""]
["05:59,480","06:04,600","\"Right we've preserved what like sites get shut down because for like some like reasons\""]
["06:04,600","06:08,160","\"But really to just switch servers like a week later like what happened next entire amazing\""]
["06:08,160","06:12,520","\"Um, it's like with sites though. It's like they can kind of be preserved\""]
["06:12,520","06:18,000","\"But people who say the HTML is really the content and then it's like the way the way back machine will save stuff sometimes\""]
["06:18,000","06:23,840","\"No, no, I just catch it. Um, you know that place. What is it? Am you paradise? Is that taking down? No?\""]
["06:23,840","06:28,040","\"They took down a lot of their ROMs. They did actually when the site is still up\""]
["06:28,040","06:31,400","\"But you're just not allowed to download the ROMs, but um\""]
["06:31,400","06:37,960","\"Well, that's kind of pointless legend has it wink wink that if you install a\""]
["06:37,960","06:42,840","\"a certain bit of code into your browser, wink, wink. This isn't true at all. That you can\""]
["06:42,840","06:44,520","\"download all the ROMs on the site anyway.\""]
["06:44,520","06:47,160","\"Wait, really wink, wink nod. I had no fucking idea.\""]
["06:47,160","06:51,240","\"And they also I think it's the full dumb people who don't do research.\""]
["06:51,240","06:57,880","\"Because hosting ROMs is illegal. They would never do it. Yeah, nobody would like host a ROM,\""]
["06:57,880","07:03,240","\"nonetheless, they wanted their life before fit. You can always go to cool ROMs.com, Chris.\""]
["07:03,240","07:07,240","\"You should just go to ROMs.com and then see what happens to your internet.\""]
["07:07,240","07:08,680","\"I would never use a ROM.\""]
["07:08,680","07:09,240","\"So...\""]

["07:17,640","07:19,560","\"What's the point of having a five of those things?\""]
["07:19,560","07:20,760","\"Is one of them lead to something?\""]
["07:20,760","07:22,760","\"One of them will just drop you onto a trap.\""]
