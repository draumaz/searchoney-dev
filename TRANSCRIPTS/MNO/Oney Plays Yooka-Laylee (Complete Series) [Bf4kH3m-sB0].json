["02:45,220","02:51,060","\"That's a very- Wait, wait, wait, wait, let me see a controller. So how come all these guys are- Oh, never mind.\""]
["02:51,060","02:56,840","\"I don't have the old one how come all these guys are allowed to have small pupils, but the main characters have to have big ugly ones\""]

["03:29,820","03:33,660","\"Since the very fucking beginning. Yeah, I think it looks fine the same way\""]
["03:33,660","03:38,160","\"These these villain characters are the closest to being appealing\""]
["03:38,160","03:41,380","\"Everything else looks fucking appalling to me. Oh\""]
["03:41,380","03:43,660","\"fuck\""]
["03:43,660","03:45,660","\"Julian's getting trouble\""]
["03:45,660","03:50,660","\"I'm gonna leave a comment and let Julian just let him know how wrong he is.\""]
["03:50,660","03:52,860","\"So evil man is evil is what I got from now.\""]
["03:52,860","03:54,660","\"Granted I wasn't reading.\""]
["03:54,660","03:56,660","\"Maybe he dropped something really important.\""]
["03:56,660","04:00,660","\"We'll see that's what the pot's about because he took the books.\""]
["04:00,660","04:02,660","\"Because now they can't read.\""]
["04:02,660","04:03,660","\"They like books.\""]
["04:03,660","04:04,660","\"I guess.\""]
["04:04,660","04:05,660","\"Okay.\""]
["04:05,660","04:06,660","\"Here he is Julian.\""]
["04:06,660","04:07,660","\"You don't think that looks good.\""]
["04:07,660","04:09,660","\"So they're gonna be, they're gonna jump around through books is what I'm guessing.\""]
["04:09,660","04:12,660","\"Make a joke about old video game.\""]
["04:12,660","04:14,660","\"I like how he sounds disgusted.\""]
["04:14,660","04:22,660","\"He's got a punch the bat in the face.\""]
["04:22,660","04:30,660","\"There was a character in Banjo Tui who was a home oh, a flaming home oh, and that's exactly what their voice sounded like in it.\""]
["04:30,660","04:32,660","\"Yes, that's funny.\""]
["04:32,660","04:35,660","\"I'm wondering if that's supposed to be the same thing.\""]
["04:35,660","04:37,660","\"It's Dee Dee, same chaz.\""]
["04:37,660","04:42,660","\"It'll do great. Everybody will draw. Everybody will draw porn. Our people draw. I haven't checked.\""]
["04:42,660","04:45,700","\"I don't know. It's a gross looking character.\""]
["04:45,700","04:46,660","\"What? Who which one?\""]
["04:46,660","04:47,700","\"Both.\""]
["04:47,700","04:50,100","\"I don't think the green one looks good.\""]
["04:50,100","04:53,780","\"The green one's better. The eye's still ruined it, but it's better.\""]
["04:53,780","04:55,140","\"Tell me how you improve it.\""]
["04:55,140","04:57,780","\"Smaller, smaller pupils.\""]
["04:57,780","04:59,860","\"That's all. I wouldn't have thought to...\""]
["04:59,860","05:00,980","\"It's also a small one.\""]
["05:00,980","05:03,780","\"That's me. I'm also just going to say it's not that interesting of a character.\""]
["05:03,780","05:08,660","\"I've seen a lot of fan art where they were they're slightly redesigned and they look a lot better.\""]
["05:08,660","05:09,540","\"Yes, I have to.\""]
["05:09,540","05:11,700","\"How would you make him more interesting?\""]
["05:11,700","05:16,580","\"Didn't think about that must fan art they made it look more interesting because they shaped the face more and everything yeah\""]
["05:16,580","05:21,380","\"Yes, dude I get to play\""]
["05:21,380","05:24,140","\"Now that feel Chris\""]
["05:24,140","05:30,340","\"That'd be really scary\""]
["05:30,340","05:40,580","\"I'm just gonna do this for the rest of the video. That's okay\""]
["05:40,580","05:42,980","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:42,980","05:43,820","\"- Okay.\""]
["05:43,820","05:45,400","\"- You know what actually seeing it in motion,\""]
["05:45,400","05:47,740","\"it doesn't look as terrible as I, as I,\""]
["05:47,740","05:48,580","\"- It looks good.\""]
["05:48,580","05:49,740","\"- As I thought from all the trailers.\""]
["05:49,740","05:51,740","\"- Yeah, I think it's pretty.\""]
["05:51,740","05:52,580","\"I like the way he--\""]
["05:52,580","05:54,180","\"- It's just the designs are really boring.\""]
["05:54,180","05:56,460","\"- I like the way he leans and shit, it feels good.\""]
["05:56,460","05:58,300","\"- The environment, I remember the environments\""]
["05:58,300","06:00,260","\"looking really like aggressively like,\""]
["06:00,260","06:02,740","\"oh look, we built this in unity.\""]
["06:02,740","06:04,260","\"- No, it looks good to me.\""]
["06:04,260","06:07,340","\"- And it looks a little, it's still not great, I think,\""]
["06:07,340","06:09,100","\"but it's not bad.\""]
["06:09,100","06:10,540","\"I'm gonna say not bad.\""]
["06:10,540","06:11,780","\"What the fuck is this guy?\""]
["06:11,780","06:16,380","\"As if people fucking give a shit like what we think about games.\""]
["06:16,380","06:18,220","\"Yeah, that's true.\""]
["06:18,220","06:19,700","\"I mean, some of them do, but they shouldn't.\""]
["06:19,700","06:20,700","\"Is my point.\""]
["06:20,700","06:21,980","\"Do you want to play our opinion?\""]
["06:21,980","06:22,860","\"I never played Badger.\""]
["06:22,860","06:24,580","\"So I don't have a fucking clue what to do.\""]
["06:24,580","06:26,980","\"They you've played a bit.\""]
["06:26,980","06:29,540","\"You we did a big stream of banjo Kazooie.\""]
["06:29,540","06:31,260","\"Did you play this yet?\""]
["06:31,260","06:32,260","\"We didn't play this one.\""]
["06:32,260","06:34,380","\"I intentionally stayed away because I wanted to see.\""]
["06:34,380","06:36,740","\"I was like that they can spin around.\""]
["06:36,740","06:39,080","\"(screaming)\""]
["06:39,080","06:43,180","\"-Had you opened big chests. -Am I kissing it?\""]

["06:55,120","06:56,480","\"-Heh heh heh. -You gonna do that.\""]
["06:56,480","06:58,560","\"-No what's the point?\""]
["06:58,560","07:01,580","\"Can you fly around with your little bat head?\""]
["07:01,580","07:06,640","\"-Uh. -So it doesn't control the same.\""]
["07:06,640","07:13,740","\"The same as you're supposed to be able to I'm gonna guess that you have to unlock that later, which is weird you start with them banjo kazooie\""]
["07:13,740","07:17,640","\"Is there fall damage? Oh\""]
["07:17,640","07:24,600","\"Phone yeah, we're there with their bottomless pits in banjo kazooie. I don't remember there being\""]
["07:24,600","07:27,640","\"These are shorts\""]
["07:27,640","07:31,080","\"Get it like a trouser snake\""]
["07:33,880","07:39,520","\"I think he's not wait he's got tiny pupils to I was gonna say he's the only\""]
["07:39,520","07:43,840","\"design I think I kind of like how come he's got tiny pupils there there's\""]
["07:43,840","07:48,880","\"nothing else in this game like him from what I've seen yeah what does he go near\""]
["07:48,880","07:56,560","\"this is fun yeah the game should just be about him how would he move very\""]
["07:56,560","08:02,560","\"carefully hey Julian hey Chris if you could change one thing about you\""]
["08:02,560","08:04,560","\"Kalele, what would it be?\""]
["08:04,560","08:11,260","\"The main characters. What would you do with them Julian? Make them look different.\""]
["08:11,260","08:18,500","\"I might even just change the species. I don't know. I don't mind days of chameleon is just but they didn't do much with it\""]
["08:18,500","08:21,160","\"Yeah, it's probably\""]
["08:21,160","08:24,560","\"More interesting way to do it. What would you have done with it? I don't know\""]
["08:24,560","08:27,280","\"Banjo had clothes\""]
["08:27,280","08:30,340","\"You had a backpack that had the bird in it. You know what? That's a good point\""]
["08:30,340","08:34,600","\"I didn't even a lot of the things that I don't like about this are very like I\""]
["08:34,600","08:40,960","\"Don't know what the word would be there like they're like subtle things that you can't name right away, but if he I\""]
["08:40,960","08:46,160","\"Think if he had like clothes or a hat or like something no, he doesn't stand out\""]
["08:46,160","08:50,280","\"Like he seems like he would be a background character in a Pixar movie\""]
["08:50,280","08:56,280","\"You know what he looks he looks like the stupid fucking chameleon from tangled. Yeah from tangled\""]
["08:56,280","09:03,280","\"I think even that has more to because at least that had facial expressions and everything.\""]
["09:03,280","09:05,640","\"That's a good point.\""]
["09:05,640","09:06,840","\"That's a very rigid face.\""]
["09:06,840","09:10,440","\"I can't see them animating anything interesting with it.\""]
["09:10,440","09:16,400","\"Okay well Julian, I don't want to rain on your parade but I think this is the best\""]
["09:16,400","09:17,400","\"game I've ever played.\""]
["09:17,400","09:19,600","\"Did I even play it?\""]
["09:19,600","09:21,320","\"No, no how to.\""]
["09:21,320","09:24,800","\"I like platformers like Crash because it's linear and you just get to a goal real quick.\""]
["09:24,800","09:30,000","\"I like Banjo-Kazooie a lot and I'll say this too, because we just played it a few days\""]
["09:30,000","09:35,440","\"back, it absolutely holds up, it's still a lot of fun, still very enjoyable.\""]
["09:35,440","09:39,160","\"Even though it was really hard for me because it's just not good at video games.\""]
["09:39,160","09:43,520","\"I mean it's probably weird adjusting to an N64 platformer like that anyways, because\""]
["09:43,520","09:44,920","\"you never played one before.\""]
["09:44,920","09:48,120","\"Yeah, I'd never touched it before that.\""]
["09:48,120","09:50,920","\"And you threw me in on the fucking fifth level or something.\""]
["09:50,920","09:53,180","\"- This is the third.\""]
["09:53,180","09:55,480","\"- What does this say?\""]
["09:55,480","09:57,280","\"So this is their ship, are they pirates?\""]
["09:57,280","09:58,760","\"- I guess.\""]
["09:58,760","10:00,120","\"Their batship crazy.\""]
["10:00,120","10:02,000","\"- People are gonna get mad that we didn't,\""]
["10:02,000","10:03,480","\"we skipped over the story.\""]
["10:03,480","10:04,320","\"I'm sorry about it.\""]
["10:04,320","10:05,160","\"- We didn't skip it.\""]
["10:05,160","10:06,000","\"Who gives a fuck?\""]
["10:06,000","10:06,840","\"- Well, you didn't read--\""]
["10:06,840","10:07,680","\"- They didn't let us skip it.\""]
["10:07,680","10:08,680","\"- You didn't read it.\""]
["10:08,680","10:10,080","\"They said it's a crashed ship\""]
["10:10,080","10:11,520","\"and maybe there were some back stories\""]
["10:11,520","10:12,360","\"that we weren't paying attention to.\""]
["10:12,360","10:13,560","\"- That's what you try.\""]
["10:13,560","10:16,240","\"That's what you get for trying to deliver story through text.\""]

["14:38,620","14:44,620","\"Remember how we're saying and saying trilogy. It's weird that they're using dynamic lighting because you can't line up jumps\""]
