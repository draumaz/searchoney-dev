["00:05,600","00:08,240","\"I don't think I'm cut out for driving in LA.\""]
["00:08,240","00:08,960","\"'Cause uh...\""]
["00:08,960","00:10,360","\"It'll give you a heart palpitations.\""]
["00:10,360","00:15,120","\"No, like, like honestly, like, uh, there's so much shit going on, like, on like a highway or whatever.\""]
["00:15,120","00:18,640","\"I think I'd only be able to drive in like a fucking long-ass dusty road.\""]
["00:18,640","00:19,320","\"The P-\""]
["00:19,320","00:20,840","\"That's the only place I'd feel good driving.\""]
["00:20,840","00:24,080","\"LA's a bad place to learn how to drive for sure. I would not want to learn how to drive.\""]
["00:24,080","00:27,200","\"Honestly, it's probably the best place to learn, 'cause if you can do LA, you can probably do anywhere else.\""]
["00:27,200","00:28,200","\"Oh, yes you're right.\""]
["00:28,680","00:32,160","\"I guess if you had to operate a car basically, you should be able to drive here.\""]
["00:32,160","00:34,800","\"Do you remember when we came here years ago, Chris?\""]
["00:34,800","00:38,320","\"We had that Uber driver who was like, \"\"Oh, it's my first time driving.\"\"\""]
["00:38,320","00:38,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:38,760","00:42,080","\"Like he was like, he had just got his license and he was like slamming the brakes and shit.\""]
["00:42,080","00:43,080","\"Was it an Uber guy?\""]
["00:43,080","00:45,040","\"No, well, it was a taxi guy.\""]
["00:45,040","00:45,640","\"It was an Uber.\""]
["00:45,640","00:48,840","\"No, it was like, what are the assistance of the company we came here for?\""]

["00:50,800","00:52,560","\"Yeah, yeah, he was like, \"\"I just started driving.\"\"\""]
["00:52,560","00:55,280","\"Do you know, LA taxi drivers are fucking nuts,\""]
["00:55,280","00:57,560","\"because they just have lost all the will to live.\""]
["00:57,560","00:59,080","\"They're also scumbags.\""]
["00:59,080","01:00,440","\"Well, not all of them, obviously, but.\""]
["01:00,440","01:01,440","\"- No, one time.\""]
["01:01,440","01:03,040","\"- Yeah, one time we were like,\""]
["01:03,040","01:04,240","\"we need to get to the airport\""]
["01:04,240","01:06,320","\"and we ordered this taxi bus thing\""]
["01:06,320","01:08,000","\"'cause there was no Uber around back then.\""]
["01:08,000","01:11,920","\"And he showed up and then he literally took,\""]
["01:11,920","01:14,200","\"I think 20 rights in a row.\""]
["01:14,200","01:16,240","\"And we were just like, wait.\""]
["01:16,240","01:18,000","\"I think me and Zach looked at each other\""]
["01:18,000","01:19,000","\"at the exact same time.\""]
["01:19,000","01:20,520","\"We were like, are you noticing this?\""]
["01:20,520","01:22,560","\"It's like, yeah, let's see if he does it again.\""]
["01:22,560","01:23,640","\"And he took another right.\""]
["01:23,640","01:24,480","\"And he took another right.\""]
["01:24,480","01:26,880","\"We were like, could you drive us to where we wanna go please?\""]
["01:26,880","01:31,980","\"Oh, yeah, sorry. He said like this GPS or something or yes, like no\""]

["01:47,660","01:51,460","\"I told the guy the address he put it in and he said put it into my phone\""]
["01:51,460","01:56,560","\"Yeah, and then he asked me to put it into my phone. It's like do you really get three GPS's or you that fucking brain dead?\""]
["01:56,560","02:03,960","\"No, like he's trying to triangulate the sprout of all three uber destroys the convenience of taxis in like three different ways\""]
["02:03,960","02:07,200","\"And it's it should have completely completely blown out of the water\""]
["02:07,200","02:14,280","\"I don't think I've ever had a bad uber experience. I've had a few maybe one but like it's way less than taxis though\""]
["02:14,280","02:17,880","\"I've never had a single good taxi experience\""]
["02:17,880","02:23,360","\"And I've had maybe like one or two bad. Well, you know, I pay eighty dollars for a fucking fifteen minute car ride\""]
["02:23,360","02:30,480","\"Yeah, we're a guy like just tries to kill you there's another one time I was in Philly and we were all getting an uber and\""]

["02:40,760","02:44,920","\"We're just like what and then he dropped us off at Walmart\""]
["02:44,920","02:48,460","\"I think and we went in and we went in and then I looked at my phone\""]
["02:48,460","02:52,980","\"He hasn't stopped at the ride and I was like I try calling him something like four times\""]
["02:52,980","02:57,220","\"Like can you stop the ride and he wouldn't pick up and he like he wasn't responding to my messages\""]
["02:57,220","03:01,700","\"And so he was just letting this ride just like continue so he was getting like $30\""]
["03:01,700","03:06,960","\"But the cool thing about uber and lift is they actually listen to you and they give you full refunds or whatever\""]
["03:06,960","03:11,200","\"Yeah, there's also a button on your phone that you can press it and it blows up your driver's head\""]
["03:11,200","03:15,660","\"That'd be fucking in the ride. That'd be worth it. It's a little bit like a scopic dawty was brainstem\""]
["03:16,580","03:20,160","\"You know, it's great to do about if you leave your phone at taxi you're fucked. You're never getting it back\""]

["04:04,960","04:07,680","\"Unredeemable\""]
["04:08,980","04:14,640","\"Like that's like for recent times like from any time like someone that you really don't like I say Adolf Hitler\""]
["04:14,640","04:16,640","\"He's too easy. I want to see you see\""]
["04:16,640","04:18,900","\"Someone that you can never ever ever\""]
["04:18,900","04:25,740","\"Actually like someone who you just fucking cannot stand. I don't want to say Rob Schneider, but he's pretty fucking weird\""]
["04:25,740","04:28,740","\"Okay, Zach. Let's just say Rob Schneider\""]
["04:28,740","04:31,960","\"So let's say you're around on your sailboat\""]
["04:32,300","04:37,600","\"Sailing the seven seas and you crash into an island. Yeah your sailboat gets eaten by an octopus and it's gone forever\""]
["04:37,600","04:40,900","\"You are completely cut off from the rest of the world forever\""]
["04:40,900","04:47,300","\"You're surrounded in a mist that when people sail into it they dissolve. He'll say Harvey Weinstein by the way\""]
["04:47,300","04:49,420","\"It said he said he's a reason. Okay, okay, okay\""]
["04:49,420","04:52,220","\"So you now you're trapped on this island. You know you're never gonna get off\""]
["04:52,220","04:56,980","\"And no one's ever gonna find you and you're all alone, but you find a pygmy tribe of mini wine steels\""]
["04:56,980","05:00,220","\"Would you fucking keep me fucking suck?\""]
["05:01,180","05:04,560","\"If you found pygmy versions of Harvey Weinstein and Rob Schneider, what would you do?\""]
["05:04,560","05:05,560","\"I fucking eat them all.\""]
["05:05,560","05:07,220","\"What would you actually do with them?\""]
["05:07,220","05:08,920","\"I'm killing them, I can't talk to them.\""]
["05:08,920","05:10,920","\"Wait, what would you do if you started-\""]
["05:10,920","05:12,180","\"Have sex with me.\""]
["05:12,180","05:13,680","\"Just come back to my room.\""]
["05:13,680","05:16,020","\"No pygmy's can't even talk.\""]
["05:16,020","05:18,680","\"Well then why does it matter that they're Harvey Weinstein?\""]
["05:18,680","05:21,360","\"Because they look and they evolved from Harvey Weinstein.\""]
["05:21,360","05:24,860","\"Because, are you saying real pygmies are saying this version of Harvey Weinstein?\""]
["05:24,860","05:25,860","\"This version.\""]
["05:25,860","05:27,660","\"Anyways, if I caught the cat.\""]
["05:27,660","05:33,520","\"The execs so what would you do if you had a bunch of little pygmy Harvey Weinstein's and Rob Schneider's and they couldn't\""]
["05:33,520","05:35,320","\"The matter of Weinstein's and the women are Schneider's\""]
["05:35,320","05:45,240","\"Chorus the Rob Schneider's to go back to their fat roof. What would you try to rule over them like a tire?\""]
["05:45,240","05:48,440","\"Yeah, I would I'd make them like build statues on me and stuff\""]
["05:48,440","05:51,480","\"Would you make the pygmies in the Snyder's start a war with one another?\""]
["05:51,480","05:55,720","\"I would do like a false flag out like burned down or they're little buildings and blame it on the other one\""]
["05:57,280","06:00,280","\"Okay, Zach, here's a new part to the story.\""]
["06:00,280","06:02,680","\"Your hands have been...\""]
["06:02,680","06:04,680","\"One day you're washing your hands in a pool of water, right?\""]
["06:04,680","06:05,180","\"Yes.\""]
["06:05,180","06:07,280","\"And you're like, \"\"Oh, this is truly paradise.\"\"\""]
["06:07,280","06:09,280","\"Plenty of water. The sun is great.\""]
["06:09,280","06:12,080","\"But the water is actually just a...\""]
["06:12,080","06:16,280","\"B-acid that all collected on the cliff, so your hands fall off, right?\""]
["06:16,280","06:18,780","\"What are these little creatures doing this to me? They poisoned me?\""]
["06:18,780","06:21,780","\"No, no, no. It's just a bunch of wasps died on a hole,\""]
["06:21,780","06:24,280","\"and you washed your hands where they died, so all of their acid is there.\""]
["06:24,280","06:29,680","\"Okay, all right, so you got no hands no more and then now you're starting to get really horny\""]
["06:29,680","06:34,020","\"You've not jerked off in four months. Yeah, would you fuck a Schneider pig me?\""]
["06:34,020","06:36,520","\"How small are they?\""]
["06:36,520","06:38,840","\"Can I overpower them easily or like they're two feet?\""]
["06:38,840","06:40,000","\"Will they like fight back?\""]
["06:40,000","06:42,920","\"Will they like tie me out with ropes and stuff if I if I hurt one of their people?\""]
["06:42,920","06:46,080","\"They'll try to fight back, but they're mostly pacifists and they use\""]
["06:46,080","06:49,960","\"Let's make a compromise instead of having no hands. Do I just have one little finger of three stub?\""]
["06:49,960","06:52,120","\"No, you got no hands. I\""]
["06:52,320","06:56,800","\"Nothing you got nothing your hands are gone. Do I have little hooks that I made them built for me?\""]
["06:56,800","07:03,440","\"Well, you got to convince them first by fucking them. Okay, I fuck I fuck one of the\""]
["07:03,440","07:07,320","\"Fuck where the wine seeds because he loves it. No, no\""]
["07:07,320","07:14,840","\"But I serve my dominance over the little wine scene then okay, so the women know who to respect okay\""]
["07:14,840","07:20,080","\"And then I have to build me little hook hands okay, that's fair and then I I massacre a half of them to show that I can do\""]
["07:20,080","07:20,580","\"I can-\""]
["07:20,580","07:21,580","\"*laughter*\""]
