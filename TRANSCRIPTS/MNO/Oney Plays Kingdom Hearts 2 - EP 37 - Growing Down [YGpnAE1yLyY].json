["05:43,060","05:49,540","\"There's another chest I didn't get that's why he's mad. I would be mad. He ripped apart the room trying to find that chest\""]
["05:49,540","05:52,460","\"You just had to have a party didn't you?\""]
["05:52,460","05:56,060","\"Hey, what's with you?\""]

["06:14,660","06:19,680","\"Oh God a kid's telling me what to do. Where did I go wrong?\""]
["06:19,680","06:22,900","\"This little- and you shut up!\""]
["06:22,900","06:27,660","\"I can't believe my life has come through this.\""]
["06:27,660","06:35,160","\"Oh.\""]
["06:35,160","06:39,360","\"But my thing is-\""]
["06:39,360","06:42,360","\"Look, this is what I am.\""]
["06:42,360","06:44,360","\"We already do that!\""]
["06:44,360","06:48,360","\"When you first got here, I tried to change.\""]
["06:48,360","06:55,360","\"But I was only fooling myself. I can't be any different.\""]
["06:55,360","06:58,360","\"I love his design. This is good.\""]
["06:58,360","07:01,360","\"Do you like his cape?\""]
["07:01,360","07:03,360","\"Yeah. I think you wear it.\""]
["07:03,360","07:06,360","\"It wouldn't suit me, because I'm not like him.\""]
["07:06,360","07:08,760","\"- You do, Chris, if you put on his cape\""]
["07:08,760","07:11,200","\"and you started growing fur and you went,\""]
["07:11,200","07:13,040","\"\"\"Oh, I'm gonna turn into the beast,\"\"\""]
["07:13,040","07:15,520","\"but then you started shrinking away.\""]
["07:15,520","07:17,920","\"- That might become a small beast.\""]
["07:17,920","07:19,640","\"- You just vanish out of existence.\""]
["07:19,640","07:21,040","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:21,040","07:22,360","\"- Why are you always doing that?\""]
["07:22,360","07:23,920","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:23,920","07:25,240","\"- What would you do to me?\""]
["07:25,240","07:27,240","\"- You cease to be.\""]
["07:27,240","07:28,080","\"- How would you feel?\""]
["07:28,080","07:29,280","\"- How would you feel?\""]
["07:29,280","07:34,000","\"- How would you feel is a more accurate way of asking,\""]
["07:34,000","07:35,680","\"what would your thought process be?\""]
["07:35,680","07:38,720","\"- Do I literally shrink until I'm no more?\""]
["07:38,720","07:40,240","\"Or do I keep shrinking and shrinking\""]
["07:40,240","07:41,760","\"until like a quantum level?\""]
["07:41,760","07:47,040","\"- You keep shrinking, like your cells are still the same.\""]
["07:47,040","07:48,560","\"So like you're shrinking,\""]
["07:48,560","07:51,240","\"you're just growing into a smaller organism.\""]
["07:51,240","07:52,080","\"- Julian, can I--\""]
["07:52,080","07:53,720","\"- Like you're slowly losing mass.\""]
["07:53,720","07:55,360","\"- Can I ask you something, Julian?\""]
["07:55,360","07:56,200","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:56,200","07:58,040","\"- Where are you expecting this to go?\""]
["07:58,040","07:58,880","\"- I don't know.\""]
["07:58,880","07:59,720","\"- I wanted to set up a--\""]
["07:59,720","08:01,520","\"- I'm pretty sure his feet would be terror.\""]
["08:01,520","08:05,120","\"- I wanted to express like, you know,\""]
["08:05,120","08:08,780","\"He starts out thinking he's gonna turn into a beast and then he turns into the opposite\""]
["08:08,780","08:14,540","\"Which is a small thing that doesn't exist. -First would you rather turn into the beast or a small person?\""]
["08:14,540","08:20,440","\"The beast. -That's true. You get to do your fantasy where you want to be inserted into a woman.\""]
["08:20,440","08:23,780","\"I don't want to be small forever, but I would want to be the beast forever.\""]
["08:23,780","08:28,320","\"Okay, if you tickle the side of your nose, you can shrink it half your height.\""]
["08:28,320","08:32,440","\"But then if you slap your belly three times,\""]
["08:33,520","08:40,420","\"You'll grow back to your regular size. Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. Okay, where you're gonna shrink into?\""]
["08:40,420","08:44,940","\"What do you mean shrink into? Well, what kind of shrinking business are you gonna get down to?\""]
["08:44,940","08:50,540","\"Are you gonna rob a bank as a tiny man? I'm gonna shrink really small walk under the door of the girl's dressing room\""]
["08:50,540","08:53,380","\"And then what?\""]
["08:53,380","08:56,620","\"Shrink down some more climb into their toenail\""]
["08:56,620","09:01,220","\"Then shrink down some more and you can observe their molecular structure\""]
["09:01,540","09:08,180","\"And then grow up and push their toenail out making them streak you can grab one of the molecules and grow with it\""]
["09:08,180","09:14,420","\"I go I can pick up her her toenail like like Jerry takes a bit big cheese\""]
["09:14,420","09:17,820","\"What from Tom and Jerry's Jerry? Oh\""]
["09:17,820","09:23,560","\"I thought Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, no, why would you sign? Don't be doing that. That's my question\""]
["09:23,560","09:30,500","\"So I climb into a girl's toenail I grow I rip her toenail outward and I run away into a mouse hole\""]
["09:30,500","09:31,340","\"- What a conversation.\""]
["09:31,340","09:32,820","\"- What's the toenail on top?\""]
["09:32,820","09:35,580","\"- And then you grow the toenail and take it to an investor\""]
["09:35,580","09:38,180","\"and say that it's a rare artifact that you discovered.\""]
["09:38,180","09:39,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:39,100","09:40,020","\"- You can't give up.\""]
["09:40,020","09:40,860","\"- Not now.\""]
["09:40,860","09:42,540","\"- I bet someone would buy it just because.\""]
["09:42,540","09:43,940","\"- It's a big toenail, yeah.\""]
["09:43,940","09:45,180","\"- No, it's not big.\""]
["09:45,180","09:47,460","\"- Oh, you didn't like it didn't grow up with you.\""]
["09:47,460","09:48,300","\"- No.\""]
["09:48,300","09:49,140","\"- Okay.\""]
["09:49,140","09:49,980","\"- Well, I was saying you go shrink\""]
["09:49,980","09:50,820","\"and then you grow really big with it.\""]
["09:50,820","09:52,180","\"- Why would you take a normal toenail to it?\""]
["09:52,180","09:54,020","\"- I didn't know I could grow things with me.\""]
["09:54,020","09:54,940","\"- I said you could grow a bit.\""]
["09:54,940","09:56,460","\"- No, I just assumed because you said\""]
["09:56,460","09:57,620","\"that you were selling it to somebody.\""]
["09:57,620","10:01,820","\"Saying that if I'm holding something it grows with me. Yeah, sure what if I put my hand on the planet Earth?\""]
["10:01,820","10:03,820","\"It just grows really big\""]
["10:03,820","10:09,360","\"Yeah, don't do that. Okay. Let's do everybody would die. We would all be crushed by the big toenail\""]
["10:09,360","10:12,080","\"I'll be like this is a slab a slab of food for\""]
["10:12,080","10:14,860","\"Starving countries\""]
["10:14,860","10:16,200","\"Dinosaur bone\""]
["10:16,200","10:20,920","\"Okay, so I'm like they would do DNA tests on it and they would realize that I don't know what to do with a\""]
["10:20,920","10:23,180","\"Fetch girl. They just believe you have a face value\""]
["10:23,180","10:27,080","\"I don't know why I assume the girl would be the would be Bell this poor girl is still like\""]
["10:27,080","10:28,080","\"Ow!\""]
["10:28,080","10:29,080","\"But if I--\""]
["10:29,080","10:30,780","\"Yeah, you tore off her fucking nail.\""]
["10:30,780","10:32,780","\"I would-- okay, I would grow her nail up real big.\""]
["10:32,780","10:33,780","\"I'd go to a sand dune.\""]
["10:33,780","10:34,980","\"So there's more to rip off.\""]
["10:34,980","10:35,980","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:35,980","10:39,080","\"I'd grow-- I'd go to a sand dune and slide down on it like a sled.\""]
["10:39,080","10:40,080","\"Okay.\""]
["10:40,080","10:45,080","\"Um, so what, you're saying I can grow up with things if I hold them?\""]
["10:45,080","10:46,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:46,080","10:47,080","\"So what if I grow up while holding my dick?\""]
["10:47,080","10:48,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:48,080","10:50,080","\"Yeah, but you're the thing that's growing to begin with.\""]
["10:50,080","10:51,080","\"Yeah, exactly.\""]
["10:51,080","10:53,080","\"So you just grow normally.\""]
["10:53,080","10:55,080","\"So if I'm holding something, it can grow.\""]
["10:55,080","10:59,000","\"Does it only kind of grow certain parts of an object or grows the entire object?\""]
["10:59,000","11:06,760","\"I would say make it all proportional. I think you would have to remove part of something from something else\""]
["11:06,760","11:08,760","\"if you want to grow it individually.\""]
["11:08,760","11:10,440","\"Okay, take the cut it.\""]
["11:10,440","11:10,940","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:10,940","11:13,160","\"Okay, cut off a girl's head.\""]
["11:13,160","11:15,480","\"Grow her head with me.\""]
["11:15,480","11:18,520","\"And then sell it as a giant head.\""]
["11:20,600","11:25,600","\"Wait till all the meat rots off of her head and then you have a school bedroom to sit in.\""]
["11:25,600","11:26,600","\"It's like a ten.\""]
["11:26,600","11:29,600","\"That's excellent. Do it DIY, Chris.\""]
["11:29,600","11:30,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:30,600","11:33,600","\"You murdered somebody so you could sleep in a giant skull.\""]
["11:33,600","11:35,600","\"Put that up on Pinterest, right?\""]
