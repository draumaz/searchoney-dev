["00:25,280","00:26,200","\"Where is Chris?\""]
["00:26,200","00:28,480","\"Give us a wild guess. What is this game about?\""]
["00:28,480","00:35,280","\"I think this game is about a pencil whose character arc involves becoming calm and collected.\""]
["00:35,280","00:38,180","\"He learns the value of monogamy.\""]
["00:38,180","00:41,580","\"He learns the value of erasing people from his life.\""]
["00:41,580","00:44,980","\"It's the dragon artifact.\""]
["00:44,980","00:47,780","\"Look at those guys.\""]
["00:47,780","00:48,980","\"Whatever those are,\""]
["00:48,980","00:53,480","\"those are the sci-fi stories and one of them went in the garbage.\""]
["00:53,480","00:56,480","\"If only all of them could have gone in there.\""]
["00:56,480","00:58,480","\"Oh, I don't like this\""]
["00:58,480","01:01,600","\"Just disturbing\""]
["01:01,600","01:05,280","\"Those chucks\""]
["01:05,280","01:08,840","\"He's gonna find a pencil\""]
["01:08,840","01:18,280","\"Yeah, whoa\""]
["01:18,280","01:23,200","\"Do I see that? He's so wild\""]

["01:41,340","01:44,520","\"You know that's what they're going for. Yeah, of course\""]
["01:51,060","01:57,140","\"What is he supposed to be? He's the dragon totem pole. He's a lump of clay. It's a cabbage\""]
["01:57,140","02:20,020","\"Imagine being the motion capture for that. It's not motion capture. Well, how did they rig his face?\""]
["02:20,580","02:22,580","\"Well, this looks different.\""]
["02:22,580","02:24,580","\"Uh, I said it to hard mode.\""]
["02:24,580","02:25,580","\"Oh boy.\""]
["02:25,580","02:27,580","\"So we're gonna have real fun playing this.\""]
["02:27,580","02:29,580","\"We're playing it the way that they didn't play Test 4.\""]
["02:29,580","02:32,580","\"They need a game almost as impossible to actually beat.\""]
["02:32,580","02:34,580","\"This music is fucking horrible.\""]
["02:34,580","02:36,580","\"Dude, who are you talking about?\""]
["02:36,580","02:39,580","\"Have you know the guy who did the music for this game\""]
["02:39,580","02:42,580","\"ended up playing guitar for Guns N' Roses later on?\""]
["02:42,580","02:43,580","\"Really?\""]
["02:43,580","02:44,580","\"Yes.\""]
["02:44,580","02:45,580","\"That's not a joke.\""]
["02:45,580","02:47,580","\"Could you do better, Chris?\""]
["02:47,580","02:48,580","\"No.\""]
["02:48,580","02:50,580","\"What if I put a burlap on your prolapse?\""]
["02:50,580","02:52,580","\"It would fit snugly.\""]
["02:52,580","02:53,580","\"I remember that was like...\""]
["02:53,580","02:55,580","\"It would fit snugly.\""]
["02:55,580","02:58,580","\"Peggy had a prolapse and she put it on the internet.\""]
["02:58,580","03:01,580","\"Put a burlap on your prolapse Peggy.\""]
["03:01,580","03:02,580","\"Yeah!\""]

["03:03,580","03:06,580","\"Bobby, I've seen your prolapse.\""]
["03:06,580","03:09,580","\"Remember her last words were \"\"hey hey hey\"\" and then she hit the ground and died.\""]
["03:09,580","03:11,580","\"She fell out of the airplane.\""]
["03:11,580","03:14,580","\"And then Hank turned around and he went \"\"whoa!\"\"\""]
["03:14,580","03:21,680","\"Who they I got so upset they cut that out of the second part. Yeah, because they end the episode on that he turns looks like a real whoa\""]
["03:21,680","03:27,300","\"And then the they they say last time I king of the hill and they cut it out. He doesn't make the sound\""]
["03:27,300","03:32,420","\"Yeah, he just turns around and it's silent by the way. I beat the level. Good job. Good job. You get ready for this song\""]
["03:32,420","03:34,940","\"So it's a little is it gonna go?\""]
["03:34,940","03:36,940","\"(sings)\""]

["03:47,940","03:48,940","\"- Oh, it is the same song.\""]
["03:48,940","03:51,940","\"- This music would probably sound fine with like a real guitar.\""]
["03:51,940","03:53,940","\"- I guess maybe in like a, like a,\""]
["03:53,940","03:55,940","\"like a drain sort of like...\""]

["03:59,940","04:00,940","\"- You lied!\""]
["04:00,940","04:02,940","\"- It probably would make it sound good, I think.\""]

["04:03,940","04:09,520","\"What's that what's prime has been up to do you think any of our watchers are old enough to know what prime is is\""]

["04:31,580","04:38,460","\"I mean, I know they did real much chicken and okay. I could it. Are you sure? Yes weird? Okay? I wonder why I thought that\""]
["04:38,460","04:44,300","\"I don't know why did you think that okay, so by the way, I beat this level\""]
["04:44,300","04:47,260","\"good job\""]
["04:47,260","04:50,460","\"How long is this stupid piece of shit pretty long?\""]
["04:50,460","04:56,060","\"Cool\""]

["05:29,700","05:35,620","\"Hate this I hate it why cuz this fucking stupid and boring and sounds like shit. Okay, so here's how you fight\""]
["05:35,620","05:41,140","\"You take all these hits because this game doesn't work it's clipping\""]
["05:41,140","05:53,580","\"What happens if you fail do you think in the 90s anybody ever well after good\""]
["05:53,580","05:56,860","\"Everybody ever had a fantasy of shoving wild woody in their pussy I\""]
["05:56,860","05:59,540","\"Mean and they're your re-throw\""]
["05:59,540","06:02,020","\"If you shut them in the eraser way, it wouldn't hurt so bad.\""]
["06:02,020","06:02,520","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:02,520","06:04,020","\"We'd probably feel pretty good.\""]
["06:04,020","06:05,180","\"You'd wiggle it around like that.\""]
["06:05,180","06:06,340","\"Ew!\""]
["06:06,340","06:08,020","\"Just keep- you're taking so much damage!\""]
["06:08,020","06:09,260","\"Let's just start going...\""]
["06:09,260","06:11,600","\"Let's go.\""]
["06:11,600","06:12,600","\"Well, can you draw?\""]
["06:12,600","06:14,760","\"Oh yeah, look, you have power-ups.\""]
["06:14,760","06:16,500","\"That was that power-up.\""]
["06:16,500","06:17,540","\"I hate it.\""]
["06:17,540","06:18,760","\"Why?\""]
["06:18,760","06:20,900","\"'Cause it's not fun, they're good.\""]
["06:20,900","06:21,940","\"You're not playing it.\""]
["06:21,940","06:22,760","\"I know.\""]

["06:23,580","06:24,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:24,080","06:24,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:24,080","06:26,080","\"When you're playing it, this is really fun.\""]
["06:26,080","06:28,580","\"You take- it just took like 50 damage off of you.\""]
["06:28,580","06:33,540","\"If you know the extent of the controls of this game, if you're the one playing it you get the suit just house stanky\""]
["06:33,540","06:39,900","\"What you did? Oh you did it you snarked you turn into an old man. That's one of the masks\""]
["06:39,900","06:49,060","\"Yeah, how much space do you think these videos take up?\""]
["06:49,060","06:52,060","\"Mostly the game\""]
["06:52,060","06:54,180","\"Did you say bitch boy?\""]
["06:54,180","06:57,940","\"Fish boy\""]
["06:57,940","06:59,940","\"He looks so happy.\""]
["06:59,940","07:02,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:02,940","07:04,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:04,940","07:07,940","\"Oh my god.\""]

["07:12,940","07:15,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:15,940","07:18,940","\"He looks so happy.\""]
["07:18,940","07:20,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:20,940","07:22,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:22,940","07:24,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:24,940","07:26,940","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:26,940","07:28,140","\"Real guitars.\""]
["07:28,140","07:29,740","\"Nobody even knows about this game.\""]
["07:29,740","07:30,640","\"I didn't mean any money.\""]
["07:30,640","07:32,140","\"So here's real guitars now.\""]
["07:32,140","07:35,740","\"I mean, you were saying that there's no playthroughs of this on YouTube, right?\""]
["07:35,740","07:37,740","\"No one has played through this game.\""]
["07:37,740","07:41,740","\"As in, nobody has finished it or nobody's recorded anything about what's ever.\""]
["07:41,740","07:44,340","\"This level is the furthest I've ever seen anyone get.\""]
["07:44,340","07:44,840","\"Really?\""]
["07:44,840","07:47,540","\"I've beaten the game, but I'm probably the only one.\""]
["07:47,540","07:48,840","\"This game is awful.\""]
["07:48,840","07:51,340","\"I'm the only person in history that be wild-boy.\""]
["07:51,340","07:54,840","\"How do you feel about that fact?\""]
["07:54,840","07:55,240","\"Uh...\""]
["07:55,240","07:56,440","\"Is that something you're proud of?\""]
["07:56,440","07:56,940","\"No.\""]
["07:56,940","08:00,740","\"Are you happy that this is what you do with your time?\""]
["08:00,740","08:03,840","\"By the way, these mushrooms on the ground hurt you for whatever reason.\""]
["08:03,840","08:04,740","\"Because they're pulsing.\""]
["08:04,740","08:05,540","\"There's no in the...\""]
["08:05,540","08:06,740","\"Well, these two.\""]
["08:06,740","08:07,240","\"How?\""]
["08:07,240","08:08,740","\"There's no indication those hurt you.\""]
["08:08,740","08:09,440","\"They're poison.\""]
["08:09,440","08:10,240","\"You just find out.\""]
["08:10,240","08:11,840","\"You're in the poison mushroom zone.\""]
["08:11,840","08:14,240","\"Oh my God.\""]
["08:14,240","08:15,540","\"Everything that glows hurts.\""]
["08:15,540","08:18,040","\"Don't hit the stalactites.\""]
["08:18,040","08:19,840","\"Stalactites.\""]
["08:19,840","08:20,840","\"Stalactites.\""]
["08:20,840","08:23,240","\"God Jesus.\""]
["08:23,240","08:24,340","\"What? It's fun.\""]
["08:24,340","08:25,240","\"God.\""]
["08:25,240","08:25,740","\"Fuck!\""]
["08:25,740","08:26,740","\"He's wild!\""]
["08:26,740","08:27,960","\"He is!\""]
["08:27,960","08:28,920","\"Ow!\""]
["08:28,920","08:31,340","\"Look out for Medusa.\""]
["08:31,340","08:33,340","\"She a bitch.\""]
["08:33,340","08:34,620","\"What do you think of his run cycle?\""]
["08:34,620","08:37,940","\"What do you think of Woody?\""]
["08:37,940","08:38,700","\"He's pretty wild.\""]
["08:38,700","08:39,580","\"Why is it pencil?\""]
["08:39,580","08:43,660","\"Wow, good question.\""]
["08:43,660","08:44,520","\"Why?\""]
["08:44,520","08:48,100","\"I mean, that's the only thing they probably came up with, too, because the plot makes no sense.\""]
["08:48,100","08:49,500","\"No, it has nothing to do with it.\""]
["08:49,500","08:50,460","\"Yeah, that's why I'm saying...\""]
["08:50,460","08:52,180","\"I know, that's why it has nothing to do with it.\""]
["08:52,180","08:54,220","\"It's like, well, fuck, we have a game about pencil.\""]
["08:54,220","08:58,060","\"Why do we have a game about pencil? How does that work? I don't know. His name is Wild Woody.\""]
["08:58,060","09:03,020","\"I- I told him Paul brought him to life, even. Could have been a Wild Eraser boy.\""]
["09:03,020","09:06,220","\"He could have been a racer head. Was the eraser head video game.\""]
["09:06,220","09:09,820","\"I'd be pretty happy if there was an eraser head game. What if it was starring Wild Woody though?\""]
["09:09,820","09:12,220","\"Even if it was- I don't care, even if it was like a really bad game.\""]
["09:12,220","09:14,220","\"It's an alternate universe where it's about Wild Woody.\""]
["09:14,220","09:18,860","\"If it was a really bad game, I'd still be happy if- like if it- if it was David Lynch's eraser head,\""]
["09:18,860","09:23,180","\"I'd probably be pleased with it. But it's Wild Woody taking care of the baby.\""]
["09:23,180","09:27,180","\"Like it could be completely the wrong thing. It could be like a JRPG\""]
["09:27,180","09:31,180","\"where like he's fighting monsters or something with a giant sword\""]
["09:31,180","09:33,180","\"and I'd still be happy.\""]
["09:33,180","09:35,180","\"Can we have a disclaimer in this episode?\""]
["09:35,180","09:37,180","\"With a disclaimer, Chris.\""]
["09:37,180","09:41,180","\"If we're not in our top form today, it's because we all ate horrible food\""]
["09:41,180","09:42,180","\"and made us sick.\""]
["09:42,180","09:45,180","\"It seems like every place that delivers to the office\""]
["09:45,180","09:47,180","\"makes us sick.\""]
["09:47,180","09:49,180","\"But this is like the worst I've ever felt.\""]
["09:51,180","09:56,660","\"How are you supposed to do that? I don't know when it's not hurting you there you go\""]
["09:56,660","10:00,260","\"Okay, I got the really bad control down\""]
["10:00,260","10:06,580","\"Seriously feel it try playing it for I don't want to please for a second just feel how this controls\""]
["10:06,580","10:09,300","\"This level has good music\""]
["10:09,300","10:16,860","\"Come on. Isn't that weird you can the first oh my god sometimes he just doesn't jive I was telling you\""]
["10:16,860","10:23,980","\"It's you need to feel it to understand how bad the controls are what he's so wild. What's he gonna do next?\""]
["10:23,980","10:25,980","\"Let me just find it.\""]
["10:25,980","10:30,620","\"I mean a\""]
["10:30,620","10:38,260","\"Like the eraser thing it would make sense if it was like oh he goes into like maybe like other sketchbooks or something or like no\""]
