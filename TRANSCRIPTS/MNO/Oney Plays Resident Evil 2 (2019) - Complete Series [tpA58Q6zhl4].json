["07:52,380","07:54,740","\"The clapping of the cloppers.\""]
["07:54,740","07:56,420","\"It's like the opening of CSI.\""]
["07:56,420","07:58,740","\"This is a strange opening if you play the original.\""]
["07:58,740","08:02,580","\"Because it's like showing all the city imagery, but you don't really spend any time in the city.\""]
["08:02,580","08:05,380","\"It does give you like a hopeless feeling now.\""]
["08:05,380","08:09,780","\"This really is like an opening to like a movie that would be on or a show on Netflix.\""]
["08:09,780","08:11,380","\"Yaw.\""]
["08:11,380","08:14,420","\"Look at it. It is totally like a Netflix like opening your original.\""]

["08:21,260","08:23,740","\"Oh, I love honkier.\""]
["08:23,740","08:25,860","\"What about tofu in tofu number two?\""]
["08:25,860","08:27,260","\"Tofu fucking sucks.\""]
["08:27,260","08:28,260","\"No!\""]
["08:28,260","08:29,260","\"That was cool.\""]
["08:29,260","08:31,260","\"They have like five different types of tofas.\""]
["08:31,260","08:32,660","\"Yeah, now I have different weapons.\""]
["08:32,660","08:33,660","\"They have a tofu.\""]
["08:33,660","08:34,660","\"That's awesome.\""]
["08:34,660","08:35,660","\"What did you do?\""]
["08:35,660","08:36,660","\"And then they have one that's like, \"\"Ah!\"\"\""]
["08:36,660","08:37,660","\"Yeah, that was being Japanese.\""]
["08:37,660","08:39,660","\"It was like a girl tofu where she eats a bitch.\""]
["08:39,660","08:40,660","\"She's like, \"\"Ah, ah!\"\"\""]
["08:40,660","08:44,660","\"What did you do with city that was shaped like the logo for Resident Evil 2?\""]
["08:44,660","08:45,660","\"I would.\""]
["08:45,660","08:47,660","\"I think we already lived there.\""]
["08:47,660","08:48,660","\"*laughs*\""]
["08:48,660","08:50,500","\"Attention, all citizens!\""]
["08:50,500","08:52,820","\"Zombies are cool, do not shoot them!\""]
["08:52,820","08:53,820","\"*laughs*\""]
["08:53,820","08:57,820","\"Philadelphia really would be an ideal city just to be taking everyone's zombies.\""]
["08:57,820","08:59,420","\"*laughs* Why would you say that?\""]
["08:59,420","09:00,820","\"It just feels like it just...\""]
["09:00,820","09:03,420","\"It's just right for his zombie taking over.\""]
["09:03,420","09:05,860","\"I remember when we played the demo for this,\""]
["09:05,860","09:09,380","\"and like afterwards we walked down, we talked about like what if zombies were like all around town?\""]
["09:09,380","09:13,540","\"Did we said that? We said that, we said the office would be like a perfect place,\""]
["09:13,540","09:16,140","\"because the iron doors are like nobody can get inside.\""]
["09:16,140","09:26,140","\"The only problem is like, um, I don't think Jeff wants to eat like our old like food like he'd have to eat like old cereal and like she sticks that would eventually go bad.\""]
["09:26,140","09:32,140","\"So I think Jeff would be screwed. Jeff would go out to Walling and get fucking eaten in the first day.\""]
["09:32,140","09:36,140","\"Jeff would just get sick of being here and he'd be like alright I'm gonna walk home.\""]
["09:36,140","09:38,140","\"And fuck off my phone with care.\""]
["09:38,140","09:43,140","\"I've got a really sad relationship with zombies and things.\""]
["09:43,140","09:46,940","\"Yeah, what is it where my uncle showed me this a res needle - when I was like\""]
["09:46,940","09:51,420","\"Eight yeah, and I got obsessed with zombies all up until I was like yeah\""]
["09:51,420","09:54,740","\"Yeah, and then I was just like you know what it's been like ten years\""]
["09:54,740","09:59,620","\"I think I've done with zombies and then the walking dead took off and I was like fucking god damn it\""]
["09:59,620","10:04,340","\"Just shut up about zombies. I can't fucking take it in the walking dead. They're kind of a third show now\""]
["10:04,340","10:10,500","\"Yeah, no walking that sucks. Yeah, they have a new liking dead show that takes place before the zombie outbreak\""]
["10:10,500","10:15,380","\"So it's just like a normal show really yeah, there's not even zombie\""]
["10:15,380","10:20,640","\"No, there's not even a outbreak. It's before the outbreaks. There's a show before the outbreaks\""]
["10:20,640","10:24,540","\"Just misery. Yeah\""]
["10:24,540","10:31,100","\"It's not like I like season one everything after it's stonky\""]
["10:31,100","10:34,760","\"It's because the guy the guy who did it made it pretty close to the original comic\""]
["10:34,760","10:38,020","\"Yeah, and the comic is good even though like I\""]
["10:39,540","10:42,440","\"Remember it's funny the same thing happened with Scott Pilgrim\""]
["10:42,440","10:44,760","\"I watched Scott Pilgrim and then the movie came out a month later\""]
["10:44,760","10:51,840","\"Yeah, and I read the walking dead in the game or the game the movie came out or the show came out like two months later\""]
["10:51,840","10:55,200","\"When I read the books, I think it's slowly fun\""]
["10:55,200","10:59,880","\"I think it's really entertaining how badly they fuck up the show every time well\""]
["10:59,880","11:02,680","\"I think it's been a while since are they still making it?\""]
["11:02,680","11:08,160","\"I don't know I stopped watching it after season one. I was watching videos at some point where they're like they fucked it up\""]
["11:08,160","11:12,800","\"Even worse this week and it just kept happening over and over. I really know when we'll stop watching it\""]
["11:12,800","11:17,040","\"Yeah, where they're like brutally killing off main characters like with no regard for anything\""]
