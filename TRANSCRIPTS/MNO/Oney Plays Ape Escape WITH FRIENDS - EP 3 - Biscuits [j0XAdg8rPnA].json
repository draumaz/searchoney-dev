["04:14,340","04:17,280","\"There's so many good ideas on this game\""]
["04:17,280","04:26,240","\"Dark Souls of reality\""]
["04:26,240","04:28,760","\"You have to roll out of the way\""]

["05:24,400","05:26,400","\"Chris!\""]
["05:26,400","05:27,400","\"Chris!\""]
["05:27,400","05:29,400","\"Was he a hermitian?\""]
["05:29,400","05:32,400","\"Yeah, he was me. Yeah, absolutely. That's right.\""]
["05:32,400","05:34,400","\"He would street race all the time.\""]
["05:34,400","05:36,400","\"South Africa.\""]
["05:36,400","05:38,400","\"Hitler street racing. Don't we know it?\""]
["05:38,400","05:40,400","\"Don't we know it? Guys, you don't get it.\""]
["05:40,400","05:42,400","\"I'm brown. I can say that. You can't though.\""]
["05:42,400","05:44,400","\"You're right. You're not Armenian.\""]
["05:44,400","05:46,400","\"I'm a rock hand. I'm a rock hands.\""]
["05:46,400","05:48,400","\"You're Morocco.\""]
["05:48,400","05:49,400","\"I sold that for Mexicans.\""]
["05:49,400","05:50,400","\"Really? Yeah.\""]
["05:50,400","05:52,400","\"That was a George Lotha's joke.\""]
["05:52,400","05:54,400","\"I mean, what's the biggest thing in Morocco?\""]
["05:54,400","05:55,400","\"George Lotha's.\""]
["05:55,400","05:56,400","\"Is there a Rocco?\""]
["05:56,400","05:57,400","\"Oh.\""]
["05:57,400","05:58,400","\"Is there like a big rock?\""]
["05:58,400","06:00,400","\"He's a Rocco statue in the center.\""]
["06:00,400","06:02,400","\"He even has a delightful British accent.\""]
["06:02,400","06:04,400","\"So are you just speedrunning?\""]
["06:04,400","06:06,400","\"Not speedrunning, but I'm going pretty fast.\""]
["06:06,400","06:07,400","\"You're blasting.\""]
["06:07,400","06:10,400","\"If he was speedrunning, he'd be doing glitches, Chris.\""]
["06:10,400","06:14,400","\"For example, if you pull the disc out, the game turns off.\""]
["06:14,400","06:16,400","\"Let's consider beating it.\""]
["06:16,400","06:18,400","\"It's called \"\"Stop and Swop.\"\"\""]
["06:18,400","06:19,400","\"That's right.\""]
["06:19,400","06:20,400","\"Vanjakus knew he didn't do it first.\""]
["06:20,400","06:22,400","\"That was the idea behind \"\"Stop and Swop\"\"\""]
["06:22,400","06:24,400","\"is that you take the game out and never play it again.\""]
["06:24,400","06:26,400","\"Oh my god.\""]
["06:26,400","06:30,400","\"Oh, he's dead. He's just a trout himself.\""]
["06:30,400","06:35,400","\"People don't like seeing the dithering like that, but I like it a lot.\""]
["06:35,400","06:36,400","\"I like it a lot.\""]
["06:36,400","06:37,400","\"Yeah, I really like how it looks.\""]
["06:37,400","06:40,400","\"Also, it's just the way to game semi-lating it. I don't think it was in the original.\""]
["06:40,400","06:43,400","\"No, it's on the actual hardware. You wouldn't be able to...\""]
["06:43,400","06:44,400","\"You probably can't see it on CRTA.\""]
["06:44,400","06:46,400","\"Exactly. You can't see it on CRTA.\""]
["06:46,400","06:49,400","\"And using standard video cables, you're not going to see it either.\""]
["06:49,400","06:53,400","\"Because that's the thing the N64 does, but it also tries the blurb in the original\""]
["06:53,400","06:58,400","\"original so you don't have to see any of that but I like it yeah I mean this one\""]
["06:58,400","07:02,400","\"does really well with the draw distance with the fog of war like thing like you\""]
["07:02,400","07:07,640","\"see the sky box behind but they see we slowly walk by it just eases in who made\""]

["07:25,880","07:30,000","\"I have not played the really story heavy, but you get to be a lot of Japanese people\""]
["07:30,000","07:33,640","\"That's what that's what you like is\""]
["07:33,640","07:37,080","\"Oh my god\""]

["07:48,920","07:53,400","\"There we go. Thanks for the extra one. Oh, no, he's dead. We got to do more\""]

["08:27,480","08:40,520","\"Like a pancake are there insta-kill pits in this game later. Yes, there are already\""]
["08:40,520","08:47,280","\"That's not it's not every level the first level of hell yeah, it stops from jumping off\""]
