["03:46,140","03:51,680","\"Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's true. I've never seen blazing saddles fully all the way through\""]
["03:51,680","03:59,780","\"It's okay people would tell you not to anymore because it's true because nobody understands satire. It's true\""]
["03:59,780","04:02,460","\"to be fair\""]
["04:02,460","04:07,040","\"It kinda says these guys. I don't like these guys very much. It's it sucks that\""]
["04:07,040","04:12,140","\"Words just lose meaning now to lose it will you because everybody says satire\""]
["04:12,460","04:16,300","\"Yeah, trying to defend something because everything's trendy everything's a meme so\""]
["04:16,300","04:19,740","\"Privilege got thrown around all the time\""]

["04:43,340","04:50,220","\"So that's part of why people would probably say that upways and saddles although the other part is that people don't pick up\""]
["04:50,220","04:54,380","\"I'm that kind of thing anymore anyway. Yeah, even if you make a joke a lot of people just don't understand\""]
["04:54,380","05:00,420","\"Well, that's what they that's what they insist is that if you make a joke about something because you're mocking the absurdity of the idea\""]
["05:00,420","05:05,900","\"They say well, you're still perpetuating it by informing people always like to bathtub with feet. I think it's a good visual\""]

["06:07,840","06:08,840","\"They've been around.\""]
["06:08,840","06:14,160","\"It just means their fanbase is more like concentrated on them and not what they make.\""]

["06:15,160","06:16,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:16,160","06:17,160","\"I guess that makes sense.\""]
["06:17,160","06:19,960","\"Yeah, they have a really dedicated audience who cares about what they do.\""]

["07:41,640","07:42,640","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["07:42,640","07:47,440","\"Because you know what that probably does go a long way towards why everybody thinks that you're so negative.\""]
