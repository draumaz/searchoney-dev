["03:40,760","03:41,920","\"What the heck was that?\""]
["03:41,920","03:43,560","\"It's just because it's haunted.\""]

["05:22,720","05:24,720","\"It's like a ball.\""]
["05:24,720","05:25,720","\"Oh my god dude.\""]
["05:25,720","05:31,920","\"I thought that when it was rolling you had to crouch down and then go into the hole.\""]
["05:31,920","05:35,480","\"The hole is that what you probably you might be right I have to hang off the edge first maybe\""]
["05:35,480","05:41,460","\"Yeah, that was awesome. I don't know. I like puzzles like that. That just fucking kill you\""]
["05:41,460","05:48,380","\"Oh my gosh, oh my god, you have to wait till that opens and then oh\""]
["05:48,380","05:51,680","\"Oh\""]

["06:05,340","06:06,440","\"Run and freaking out.\""]
["06:06,440","06:09,800","\"That's what they should have called it.\""]
["06:09,800","06:11,340","\"Not inside.\""]
["06:11,340","06:14,780","\"Oh my God.\""]
["06:14,780","06:15,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:15,620","06:18,980","\"This room represents running around\""]
["06:18,980","06:21,420","\"as a little boy in a video game.\""]
["06:21,420","06:23,380","\"Wow, I would never have guessed that.\""]
["06:23,380","06:24,380","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:24,380","06:26,060","\"This is just art.\""]

["06:51,220","06:52,220","\"Yeah, what's up, dog?\""]
["06:52,220","06:57,220","\"I heard that, um, the year this game came out, you went into a reclusive state for a year\""]
["06:57,220","07:01,220","\"for a year because you felt so worthless in comparison to this game.\""]
["07:01,220","07:07,220","\"No, I was just going into an embryo anyway. I do like a cocoon thing every so often.\""]
["07:07,220","07:10,220","\"Oh, what does that what benefits are there?\""]
["07:10,220","07:12,220","\"Oh, there's none. I just like doing it.\""]
["07:12,220","07:16,220","\"It's actually kind of bad for you. Like all great things in life.\""]
["07:16,220","07:21,220","\"Like all vices, like drinking. It's not good for you. It's just fun.\""]
["07:21,220","07:24,220","\"Yo, yo, here's something that I actually want to talk about, right?\""]
["07:24,220","07:26,980","\"You're a little we chap. Oh, yes\""]
["07:26,980","07:32,220","\"Well, I knew that was there that still made me jump. We'll talk about what I wanted to talk about in a sec\""]
["07:32,220","07:35,500","\"This is fucked up now. It doesn't come in yet. Whoa\""]
["07:35,500","07:42,820","\"Okay, well, okay, you know when you're a little boy in school everyone's like bears go into hibernation for the winter\""]
["07:42,820","07:48,380","\"Yeah, like but then I didn't think about it until like 20 years later. How the fuck does that work?\""]
["07:48,380","07:49,420","\"How do they do that?\""]
["07:49,420","07:54,100","\"They eat enough and then they sleep for three months, but they wake up intermittently and\""]
["07:54,100","07:56,020","\"they do a little bit of hunting.\""]
["07:56,020","07:57,020","\"Do they?\""]
["07:57,020","07:59,220","\"I thought that they just...\""]
["07:59,220","08:05,140","\"The way that they slept it was just super like low calorie intensive so that it didn't...\""]
["08:05,140","08:06,140","\"I could be wrong.\""]
["08:06,140","08:08,980","\"Yeah, they put themselves kind of on rest mode, you know, like PlayStation rest mode.\""]
["08:08,980","08:09,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:09,980","08:10,980","\"And they just kind of go...\""]
["08:10,980","08:16,380","\"So they evolved so that when the shitty months come with no food, they just don't wake up.\""]
["08:16,380","08:17,380","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["08:17,380","08:23,420","\"They fill their bellies up crazy. How come us humans can't do that because we're stupid. Why would you want to do it?\""]
["08:23,420","08:31,340","\"Humans actually just our survival instincts are fucking garbage like when you think about the fact that we can't even survive on our own\""]
["08:31,340","08:38,820","\"Till we're at least like at least like 12 or something. Yeah, like if we're talking. Yeah, yeah, actually you're about right there\""]
["08:38,820","08:46,780","\"At least like most people wouldn't but some people would I mean yeah like if you were raised to survive you could probably learn survival by\""]
["08:46,780","08:51,600","\"By probably maybe like 12 or 10 if you're a fast learner\""]
["08:51,600","08:59,620","\"You know what animals are genuinely like fucking awful for survival or dogs? Well, they're domesticated right\""]
["08:59,620","09:05,240","\"So us humans made them fucking stupid. Yeah, they can't do shit\""]
["09:05,240","09:10,800","\"They'll chew through wires and they'll jump into pools and drown and they'll fucking run out on the street and get run over\""]
["09:10,800","09:16,280","\"No, dude, they'll fucking do you ever watch that program where it's like tells you after humans or something that's called?\""]
["09:16,280","09:21,340","\"They say like the first thing that will happen well one of the first things that will happen after all the people die or like\""]
["09:21,340","09:26,680","\"a lot of most of the people dies the dogs will start going into packs like it domesticated dogs and they'll kind of\""]
["09:26,680","09:31,320","\"Wolfify up a bit really yeah, cuz they'll start getting all alpha and shit because they're only with dogs\""]
["09:31,320","09:37,120","\"Well, that's good to know so they'll they'll try to eat you cockroaches will turn orange\""]
["09:37,120","09:43,060","\"Emcecrete orange cockroaches probably won't fucking change at all those stupid things live through everything\""]
["09:43,060","09:45,920","\"I would I would hate I would hate it\""]
["09:45,920","09:50,880","\"Cockroach you don't live through my fucking shoe would squish in him you could come up at a time\""]
["09:50,880","09:57,000","\"It would live for a fucking week if you step on a cockroach it like it helps there like like\""]
["09:57,000","10:00,760","\"They're immune system. No, no, no, no if you step on a cockroach\""]
["10:00,760","10:06,720","\"It helps spread the cockroaches around cuz the egg stick to your shoe. What yeah, they're egg stick to your shoe unless you like\""]
["10:06,720","10:11,920","\"Fucking wash them off or scrape them off. I did not know that yeah, and then you help them spread. Oh\""]
["10:12,680","10:18,400","\"Man, so even when you like kill them beyond repair they it's just making more cockroaches. That's how annoying there\""]
["10:18,400","10:21,800","\"Well, they're gonna have the babies anyway, but you're helping spread them around the world\""]
["10:21,800","10:25,200","\"It's so fun. It's new colonies. Yeah, god damn it\""]
["10:25,200","10:33,720","\"Did you know that um cockroaches have little tiny human arms if you assume it?\""]
["10:33,720","10:39,300","\"Yeah, if you zoom in they got little biceps and they got little tattoos that say mom on them\""]
["10:41,480","10:47,840","\"They never met her mom because it's on the other tattoo the other tattoo has just a picture of the shoe that oh fuck. Oh look at that. Oh\""]

["11:08,040","11:10,920","\"She's naked\""]
["11:10,920","11:17,040","\"That animation on her hair is so fucking good. That looks awesome. Yeah, get the fuck out. It's not even animation\""]
