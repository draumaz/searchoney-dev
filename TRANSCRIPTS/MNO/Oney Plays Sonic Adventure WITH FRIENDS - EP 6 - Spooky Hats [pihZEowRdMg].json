["05:18,560","05:24,700","\"You're right. Okay, so there's five. I like that these hats are shaped like like spook spook hat what\""]
["05:24,700","05:29,280","\"Are you dead again?\""]
["05:29,280","05:34,720","\"Nobody thinks of that word as a slur except you it's not true. Yeah, I don't get that one\""]
["05:34,720","05:38,800","\"I don't get coons either. It's because it's because if you say\""]
["05:38,800","05:43,540","\"That's probably reaching I what my association\""]
["05:44,080","05:50,240","\"When you say spook I could I could maybe it's that they're because they disappear in the dark. I guess\""]
["05:50,240","05:53,080","\"Is that what it would be yes?\""]

["06:03,460","06:09,060","\"Harder to see black people in the dark. It's come I think it would just come down to the way you say it if you say it\""]

["06:11,680","06:15,840","\"What if you were like, oh look it's a nice old spook remember they said it's going in\""]
["06:15,840","06:21,300","\"It's a trigger triggered as in the don't I try don't think the code gets triggered. It sounds like\""]
["06:21,300","06:28,480","\"That's what that's not what I was thinking Chris. What were you thinking? I was thinking of triggered\""]
["06:28,480","06:36,520","\"You can say triggered. No, you can't you can't you might not trigger it might be you say trigonometry that you can say bad\""]
["06:36,520","06:39,040","\"Okay, so let's say that from now on okay\""]
["06:39,160","06:42,640","\"We don't want to trigonometry anybody get that trigonometry out of here\""]
["06:42,640","06:51,120","\"The fuck is that you really like trigonometry? I have to use it all the time. Yeah, he's he's a coder. He has\""]
["06:51,120","06:53,120","\"But he's coming yes to know all that maths\""]
["06:53,120","06:58,000","\"I get\""]

["07:01,520","07:05,260","\"The bottle was empty I still saw it come out. I did it you liar\""]
["07:05,260","07:14,500","\"I get frustrated when I see people all like oh yeah like I really need to use algebra outside of school\""]
["07:14,500","07:20,460","\"There's a lot of practical applications for algebra. I was gonna say how much math do you actually using code?\""]
["07:20,460","07:23,300","\"Constantly always but is it actual math?\""]
["07:23,300","07:26,500","\"Cosines constant\""]
["07:26,500","07:32,860","\"Constantly hmm. What do you want to tell me an example even outside of coding if you're gonna be using angles anyway?\""]
["07:32,860","07:38,660","\"You have to get the sign and cosign of it if you're gonna change the x and y position of something based on an angle get okay\""]
["07:38,660","07:46,340","\"The whole time sorry ding dong didn't spot it till the end\""]
["07:46,340","07:52,300","\"Sorry, this is my favorite song. This is up and down and all around up and down and all ran\""]
["07:52,300","07:56,540","\"I didn't mean it keep going keep telling me about no cosign. You'll get nothing no more\""]
["07:56,540","08:02,380","\"I don't even know what it means. That's a sign your life away one side is just cosign tan\""]
