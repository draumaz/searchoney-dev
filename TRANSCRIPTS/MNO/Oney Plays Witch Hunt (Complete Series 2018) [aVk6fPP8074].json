["00:51,000","00:53,460","\"It makes for an interesting concept, so we'll keep going.\""]
["00:53,460","00:58,940","\"Mm-hmm something big attacked me on my way to Belleville. I was able to scoot scared off\""]
["00:58,940","01:05,820","\"But my horse ran away with most of my supplies luckily. I was able to get to town on foot shit\""]

["01:52,780","01:59,180","\"Do you know how to get coins? Yeah, okay, so what we got to do is we got to go out in the world and hunt for treasure\""]

["02:13,100","02:16,920","\"These are my skills. They stay on me once I have them forever, which is kind of cool\""]
["02:16,920","02:22,340","\"So you can't lose them mm-hmm. They don't fall off you like sonic rigs. We get hit where you prayed at church\""]
["02:22,340","02:28,580","\"That's uncle church. You're probably looking for a lot of weight. No probably looking\""]

["02:56,940","02:58,900","\"Does it mean does it tell you a way to go?\""]
["02:58,900","03:02,800","\"Do you just kind of explore yourself and figure out what you well first? We're gonna go here. This is the\""]

["03:22,660","03:28,200","\"Bridge there careful people have seen some undead creatures in those woods\""]
["03:28,200","03:33,020","\"So we are dealing with something much more sinister than just a wild beast\""]
["03:33,020","03:36,340","\"Good luck and God bless you\""]
["03:36,340","03:39,180","\"Okay, so that's what I like about this game\""]

["04:37,500","04:40,620","\"It's best to start running to identify the direction of the monster\""]
["04:40,620","04:45,560","\"People say that I possess this ability because the blood of an angel runs through my veins\""]
["04:45,560","04:48,880","\"So basically it works like Slenderman, right?\""]
["04:48,880","04:54,420","\"Where it's like it the closer he gets you you get static. It's the same kind of thing\""]
["04:54,420","05:00,300","\"Actually, I'm not sure. I so you haven't even gotten this far. Have you I've never actually come across the beast\""]

["05:23,820","05:28,180","\"Switching weapons is fast and reloading so right if you take a shot and you miss\""]
["05:28,180","05:31,340","\"It's gonna take you a long time to reload and you right click the aim\""]
["05:31,980","05:36,740","\"Okay, so when this guy is so bad. We're trying to know it's not he's small on the screen. Oh\""]

["06:14,780","06:18,020","\"thing about this game is what you're hunting it's on a big world map right\""]
["06:18,020","06:21,260","\"so it's just wandering so you might just run into it no matter where you go\""]
["06:21,260","06:25,060","\"so you just walk around and now can I see the map at all is really good that\""]
["06:25,060","06:27,160","\"I don't think you have a map yet push M\""]
["06:27,160","06:33,060","\"I thought I don't okay never mind\""]

["06:44,280","06:47,460","\"That's not like a tree bridge right\""]
["06:47,460","06:51,260","\"You thought you heard a tree break and that's what I thought I heard\""]
["06:52,980","06:54,980","\"What do you think of the atmosphere?\""]
["06:54,980","07:02,060","\"I like how it's not even like dark dark, but it's like dark enough. It's gloomy. It's gloomy. It's a little it's twilight\""]
["07:02,060","07:07,400","\"I love gloomy shit. I love also. I'm a huge fan of like wooded areas in video games\""]

["07:26,240","07:30,300","\"Just keep going just keep going we got to find it\""]
["07:30,300","07:37,740","\"I'm gonna run full speed of full speed ahead so I'm assuming because this game is called witch hunt you're hunting down a witch\""]
["07:37,740","07:44,880","\"Yeah, I think now you let you say that because you played this and you know you know, oh, oh fuck what's happening?\""]

["07:47,460","07:51,540","\"All right, I don't actually know what's happening there\""]
["07:51,540","07:55,880","\"I think that was it. I think that was being close to something really yeah, I think so oh\""]
["07:55,880","08:04,340","\"Do you see anything? Oh, fuck oh, I guess you're not supposed to look in the direction of it or something? Yeah, don't look that way\""]
["08:04,340","08:05,740","\"I'm guessing\""]
["08:05,740","08:07,740","\"So it must be\""]
["08:07,740","08:15,740","\"Huh, I guess you were in its line of sight. I'm not sure oh I think it's up there. These straight ahead\""]
["08:18,900","08:21,300","\"Oh no. Oh no. Oh, that's a dog. That's a dog.\""]
["08:21,300","08:22,940","\"[screaming]\""]
["08:22,940","08:24,940","\"[screaming]\""]
["08:24,940","08:27,540","\"No! You're kidding me. I forgot the reload.\""]
["08:27,540","08:28,340","\"You did a reload.\""]
["08:28,340","08:30,140","\"I'm gonna give it a go until you die and we'll switch.\""]
["08:30,140","08:30,980","\"Okay, sure.\""]
["08:30,980","08:31,980","\"That's stonk.\""]
["08:31,980","08:33,580","\"Don't worry. That's how it goes.\""]
["08:33,580","08:35,580","\"That's what I wanted.\""]
["08:35,580","08:38,420","\"Okay, I think I got a fairly good idea of it though.\""]
["08:38,420","08:40,580","\"I wanted the experience where you go in and blind\""]
["08:40,580","08:42,020","\"'cause it's this kind of a game.\""]
["08:42,020","08:43,620","\"This isn't a story-driven game.\""]
["08:43,620","08:46,500","\"You're literally supposed to just go in and explore.\""]
["08:46,500","08:49,100","\"this would be really interesting v_i_ think\""]
["08:49,100","08:51,100","\"it would be fucking horrifying\""]
["08:51,100","08:53,000","\"good for the\""]
["08:53,000","08:55,700","\"you got a reload like that\""]
["08:55,700","08:57,700","\"it's also a really great way to cut\""]
["08:57,700","09:00,920","\"gives us a sense of the way we're in a natural way\""]
["09:00,920","09:04,300","\"i'm running down the road i think it will i think from what i understand that\""]
["09:04,300","09:06,900","\"that is like the stupid static thing\""]
["09:06,900","09:09,900","\"i think so i think you're not supposed to look in the direction of it\""]
["09:09,900","09:13,380","\"and i may be wrong i'm not sure but i think that's the key that was that the\""]
["09:13,380","09:16,280","\"The question is this is that dog gonna be the same spotters at all random eyes\""]
["09:16,280","09:21,400","\"I think it's randomized and I think because we're some kind of van hell's a wish go left\""]
["09:21,400","09:25,380","\"It's you've go up to that area. I was at earlier and see if you look at the area see if you get a sword a\""]
["09:25,380","09:28,220","\"little red\""]
["09:28,220","09:30,360","\"Deal\""]
["09:30,360","09:34,500","\"Yeah, I look I was up here. I looked to the right beyond this rock and I got the little red thing\""]
["09:34,500","09:37,260","\"Oh\""]
["09:37,260","09:39,260","\"What's that?\""]
["09:39,260","09:41,460","\"Something is probably in this area\""]
["09:41,460","09:48,460","\"What the fuck was that? Did that say die?\""]
["09:48,460","09:51,460","\"Yeah, I whispered something. I don't know if it's a die, but it whispered something.\""]
["09:51,460","09:54,460","\"I am not good at horror games.\""]
["09:54,460","09:58,460","\"I think I just heard the grudge growl.\""]
["09:58,460","09:59,460","\"Oh my god.\""]
["09:59,460","10:02,460","\"That's what I like about this though. There's a lot of cool sounds.\""]
["10:02,460","10:08,460","\"No, I think good... I was saying before, I think good sound design is one of the most important things in any piece of media.\""]
["10:08,460","10:10,460","\"'cause it puts your brain in the right mood.\""]
["10:10,460","10:12,560","\"So...\""]
["10:12,560","10:14,800","\"Where the fuck are we?\""]

["10:17,700","10:19,140","\"Oh, okay.\""]
["10:19,140","10:21,100","\"So what?\""]
["10:21,100","10:22,460","\"What does that mean?\""]
["10:22,460","10:23,800","\"Whoa!\""]
["10:23,800","10:24,600","\"Where is it?\""]
["10:24,600","10:25,660","\"Where?\""]
["10:25,660","10:26,820","\"Look at your little thing down there.\""]
["10:26,820","10:28,400","\"I think you might be really towards it right now.\""]
["10:28,400","10:29,140","\"Maybe not.\""]
["10:29,140","10:31,820","\"Aren't you supposed to head in the direction of it?\""]
["10:31,820","10:33,200","\"Oh, I think maybe you are.\""]

["10:34,740","10:36,600","\"Are we going the right way?\""]
["10:36,600","10:44,740","\"I've never actually ran into it. Oh my god. Now here's my question. Maybe I skipped over to\""]
["10:44,740","10:49,160","\"forgot it, but what that thing goes down. Do you lose health? I think that's just my magic. It's like\""]
["10:49,160","10:54,080","\"sipping my little magic my little magic sprites. How does that replenish just by killing something?\""]
["10:54,080","10:58,720","\"I think so. Yeah. Oh, so I see. See if it's entered to kill little things so that way you have an idea of\""]

["41:39,560","41:42,560","\"This game is uh, I really like it\""]
["41:42,560","41:47,920","\"It's definitely does everything you don't need big bells and whistles to make a fucking good game\""]
["41:47,920","41:54,560","\"Just need to make it atmospheric and yeah, you see you seriously like a good lighting and good sound effects and good music\""]
["41:54,560","41:59,200","\"And ambience and spooks it spooks the scares the goggles and goggles and ghouls\""]
["41:59,200","42:02,920","\"Okay, I'm gonna ask you a little thing. What do you think of jump scares?\""]
["42:02,920","42:05,880","\"It depends how they're done. I\""]
["42:06,760","42:07,960","\"I think uh...\""]
["42:07,960","42:10,360","\"I think if they're like rare, they're okay.\""]
["42:10,360","42:10,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["42:10,960","42:12,360","\"Oh, yeah, there it is over there.\""]
["42:12,360","42:13,800","\"If you know it's coming, it's better.\""]
["42:13,800","42:15,760","\"I think if it just comes out, it's a cheap one.\""]
["42:15,760","42:16,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["42:16,760","42:18,360","\"But if it builds up...\""]

["42:19,040","42:21,760","\"My favorite scares are the ones we were the audience creeped out.\""]
["42:21,760","42:22,640","\"That's scared.\""]
["42:22,640","42:23,360","\"Yeah, me too.\""]
["42:23,360","42:29,240","\"I like the people leaving a movie or a TV show and leaving their lights on\""]
["42:29,240","42:31,320","\"rather than just being scared for one second.\""]
["42:31,320","42:32,960","\"I think this game is a good mix of all.\""]
["42:32,960","42:35,600","\"There's a couple of jump scares with that little fucking black mist thing.\""]
["42:35,600","42:41,120","\"Yeah, I think the black mess thing is gonna lose charm very very quickly. Yeah, it shouldn't go like that\""]
["42:41,120","42:43,960","\"Should go like oh, what is this thing?\""]
["42:43,960","42:46,800","\"Hello\""]

["43:17,200","43:20,640","\"Is it already after you? No, I\""]
["43:20,640","43:26,500","\"Hate that on I'm pretty sure they coded it so that when you face away from it it chases you with just the right speed\""]
["43:26,500","43:28,500","\"So that you have to eventually face it\""]
["43:30,360","43:36,240","\"That's a tree with something for a second trees don't actually fucking talk so I thought it was talking to whoa\""]
["43:36,240","43:42,680","\"What the hell is happening here? I think I overran my man. Oh, he's just exhausted. Yeah, also. What's this new breathing?\""]

["44:37,180","44:41,480","\"So we got 96 coins. We're just shy of a hundred fuck\""]

["45:01,880","45:10,040","\"Shadowbug your visibility the enemies becomes equal to your crap. I didn't know you can actually fucking sneak\""]

["45:53,420","45:56,140","\"So I know what to do better. Yes, so we actually have a better idea\""]
["45:56,140","45:59,180","\"So for those of the two of you who actually had to play this game\""]
["45:59,180","46:01,940","\"Out there who know what's going on\""]
["46:01,940","46:05,300","\"Chris knows how to play better, but I am still completely ignorant\""]
