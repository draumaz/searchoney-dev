["00:11,400","00:14,680","\"\"\"I can, uh, make my weapon good now.\"\"\""]
["00:14,680","00:17,240","\"How many different types of spooks are there in this game?\""]
["00:17,240","00:18,800","\"Just toilet monsters.\""]
["00:18,800","00:21,440","\"\"\"Julian, the Halberd is better than the club.\"\"\""]
["00:21,440","00:22,960","\"Okay, use it.\""]

["00:29,960","00:31,960","\"I'll be a lot better with this.\""]
["00:31,960","00:38,960","\"Okay, now activate the God hand.\""]
["00:38,960","00:39,960","\"The God hand?\""]
["00:39,960","00:42,960","\"You can get something kinda like that.\""]
["00:42,960","00:44,960","\"It's called the grabbo.\""]
["00:44,960","00:46,960","\"They smelly grabbo.\""]

["00:57,960","01:01,480","\"I don't know what that means. What are you talking about?\""]
["01:01,480","01:04,120","\"We get really mad when you make some points in vitality.\""]
["01:04,120","01:05,640","\"Is this your health?\""]
["01:05,640","01:08,840","\"Oh, well isn't that good? Don't you want lots of health?\""]

["01:12,840","01:13,400","\"I see.\""]
["01:13,400","01:15,160","\"But I only wanted just the point.\""]
["01:15,160","01:22,920","\"Because in games like these people want you to not do anything, so you challenge yourself.\""]
["01:24,760","01:32,400","\"Yeah, because there's people who do this whole game on like just not even like no upgrades no upgrades, which is really fucking hard\""]
["01:32,400","01:40,060","\"So once they see that play through every other playthroughs like this is fucking stinky. I wish I was\""]
["01:40,060","01:48,080","\"All he just poked everybody is it is interesting or is it just a lot of rolling and fights lasting longer?\""]
["01:48,080","01:54,240","\"No, it's just dodging shit. Yeah, cuz that's what God hand turns into any other artists really\""]
["01:54,240","01:59,720","\"Yeah, it's just lots and lots and lots of you hoping to find one opening\""]
["01:59,720","02:14,080","\"There's too many pink skeletons\""]
["02:18,240","02:20,240","\"Pink skeletons on parade\""]

["02:36,000","02:38,360","\"Should I get him? No. No\""]
["02:38,360","02:44,000","\"Let him go home. Julian hasn't seen him. Fine bring him in and kill him\""]
["02:44,000","02:47,760","\"He's just a guy that fights with you. So Julian, you know that gold guy killed\""]
["02:47,760","02:52,040","\"Yeah, he comes in later any fucking murders someone very important to you\""]
["02:52,040","02:57,600","\"Oh, no, and you can't level up her rest that nice fireling tri-close no more for a while\""]
["02:57,600","03:03,200","\"I remember this place. Do you remember there's two there's two dragon man the Gargas\""]
["03:03,200","03:13,760","\"Come on down you mean\""]
["03:13,760","03:16,360","\"Yamin's get your mings down a\""]
["03:17,240","03:19,540","\"Be ashamed of these things were alive. Oh\""]
["03:19,540","03:24,660","\"My god\""]
["03:24,660","03:31,540","\"How long have they been sitting there not moving yeah calm the fuck down\""]
["03:31,540","03:35,780","\"This is a problem\""]
["03:35,780","03:43,860","\"What do you think Julie pretty cool, huh?\""]
["03:45,140","03:47,140","\"Wow, I died what the fuck is that?\""]
["03:47,140","03:56,140","\"Give me cheap bitch. You bitch. You bitch. Then everyone says I was scared to death from first one then the other one come\""]
["03:56,140","04:01,300","\"Oh God, it's a bit of lagging my feet because you're gonna die\""]
["04:01,300","04:08,140","\"Would have died without a little slayer though, that's for sure. Oh my god\""]
["04:10,420","04:16,540","\"He's raining tire. That's what it's why I never ever liked bringing people in because it just takes away from the fights\""]
["04:16,540","04:21,740","\"Like this one specific, you know, you don't get no impact from anymore\""]
["04:21,740","04:25,980","\"I don't like fighting two things at once in this game though. That's true\""]
["04:25,980","04:35,340","\"Oh no, what the fuck hit it\""]
["04:38,300","04:42,380","\"Oh, he turned to snow. I don't think I like that in any game\""]
["04:42,380","04:49,500","\"Singing more than one thing at a time. I'm trying to think of games. They're okay with it\""]
["04:49,500","04:55,420","\"I know that limits a lot of the games. I like in a sense stupid was just the way I am\""]
["04:55,420","05:00,860","\"Looked you in by the end to the sense by the end of God hand\""]
["05:00,860","05:06,140","\"You just have to run away from fights all the time because if there's three people at once they can just fucking kill you in one\""]
["05:06,140","05:11,420","\"head. I can't think of too many games that are good about group fights like that.\""]
["05:11,420","05:17,260","\"This is kind of a thing too. That's what it's like in most games.\""]
["05:17,260","05:24,380","\"What do you mean? Just in general even like multiplayer games like Smash Brothers or something\""]
["05:24,380","05:29,580","\"if you're in a crowd of people you're probably just gonna get wailed on repeatedly. Yeah,\""]
["05:29,580","05:34,860","\"so that's why people like to be uh two one or one one. Well if they play that too if you have\""]
["05:34,860","05:40,740","\"Like for people there's always the asshole who stays away from everybody because he knows oh if I don't fight then I'm gonna win\""]
["05:40,740","05:43,740","\"That kind of thing\""]
["05:43,740","05:48,920","\"It's even kind of like that in player on groan player on groan player unknowns by the ground\""]
["05:48,920","05:51,580","\"Player in groan\""]
["05:51,580","05:54,940","\"In groan hair battle ground\""]
["05:54,940","06:00,260","\"Where you just kind of just waiting for everyone to kill each other and it's not really that's the most viable strategy\""]
["06:00,260","06:03,220","\"Yeah, no, and that's the thing you get rewarded for it. Wow\""]
["06:03,940","06:11,120","\"You like that he's gonna go save some people from a fire. It's cuz it's realistic Chris. I know it's a situation group fights\""]
["06:11,120","06:19,620","\"There's no benefit to going out into the fight. I like games that are fucking really fair and gamey if you get me I\""]
["06:19,620","06:22,420","\"Hear you\""]
["06:22,420","06:27,540","\"Like games that have big rames as a big taste\""]
["06:27,540","06:36,400","\"That's what he says to big rams is a big tames\""]
["06:36,400","06:46,220","\"I mean that's essentially what he does. He says how he has a big C and then he\""]
["06:46,220","06:51,020","\"starts saying how much he hates him he's complimenting him and then says he\""]
["06:51,020","06:52,420","\"doesn't like him anymore\""]
["06:52,420","06:54,180","\"Big rams, big rams\""]
["06:54,180","06:56,020","\"just like Inspector Gadget, he says,\""]
["06:56,020","06:58,740","\"I love Minecraft, what's the point of Minecraft?\""]
["06:58,740","07:00,260","\"- There he goes on about for two minutes,\""]
["07:00,260","07:02,880","\"and says, what is the point of Minecraft?\""]
["07:02,880","07:06,660","\"- Well, I think he did something very creative.\""]
["07:06,660","07:10,620","\"- By taking the video down and then filing a copy right on him.\""]
["07:10,620","07:12,100","\"- Life's good sometimes.\""]
["07:12,100","07:13,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:13,100","07:14,940","\"- Sometimes it is.\""]
["07:14,940","07:15,780","\"He says, I guess--\""]
["07:15,780","07:17,980","\"- Today was a pretty good day, we got a lot recorded\""]
["07:17,980","07:19,620","\"and we had fun with everything.\""]
["07:19,620","07:21,180","\"- Yeah, we made two Crash Bandicoot.\""]
["07:21,180","07:22,460","\"- Yeah, we had a hoot and a hauler\""]
["07:22,460","07:28,540","\"making some stupid crash bandicoot videos that probably were like two weeks ago for all\""]
["07:28,540","07:29,540","\"the viewers.\""]
["07:29,540","07:35,420","\"The reason we did that was because Ding Dong received some angry messages that it wasn't\""]
["07:35,420","07:40,140","\"cool that peanut butter wasn't winning over B for Roni.\""]
["07:40,140","07:41,140","\"In the game, it's done quick.\""]
["07:41,140","07:43,980","\"Well, I didn't even put B for Roni in, so no, we didn't.\""]
["07:43,980","07:44,980","\"We didn't care about it.\""]
["07:44,980","07:45,980","\"Yes.\""]
["07:45,980","07:51,380","\"I did donate because I always donate whenever it's doctors without borders.\""]
["07:51,380","07:57,780","\"But someone put beefaroni in and one of the guys, one of the people who's reading donations\""]
["07:57,780","08:01,240","\"there said he hopes beefaroni wins.\""]
["08:01,240","08:03,380","\"And it's shot up to like a thousand dollars.\""]
["08:03,380","08:06,820","\"Well peanut butter was at like 200 or something.\""]
["08:06,820","08:10,280","\"And the people who put peanut butter in were getting very mad and were setting me\""]
["08:10,280","08:12,280","\"tweets, getting upset.\""]
["08:12,280","08:17,580","\"It was like, let's make Chris Banacupag for beefaroni to win.\""]
["08:17,580","08:19,580","\"It was really funny.\""]
["08:19,580","08:21,580","\"It was a good day, baby.\""]
["08:21,580","08:23,580","\"Do I need anything else?\""]
["08:23,580","08:24,580","\"I don't think I do.\""]
["08:24,580","08:27,580","\"I'm gonna do Strength forever and ever and ever.\""]
["08:27,580","08:29,580","\"Would you have T-Dub on?\""]

["08:38,580","08:40,580","\"He's probably a big mess.\""]
["08:40,580","08:42,580","\"Probably like 40 now, right?\""]
["08:42,580","08:43,580","\"You think?\""]
["08:43,580","08:45,580","\"Cause that wasn't that an old video?\""]
["08:45,580","08:46,580","\"No.\""]
["08:46,580","08:48,580","\"It looks like it was from like 2001 or something.\""]
["08:48,580","08:58,180","\"is relatively recent. Uh, where are the things he always says? He says down, town, brown,\""]

["09:10,300","09:15,940","\"That's disgusting. You see? He's a good man.\""]
["09:15,940","09:19,180","\"So he says go downtown with the big brown.\""]
["09:19,180","09:20,940","\"Oh no.\""]
["09:20,940","09:26,820","\"Does he say \"\"unfoilet\"\"?\""]
["09:26,820","09:27,820","\"Like a toilet?\""]

["09:37,660","09:39,860","\"No, I thought he said \"\"unfoilet.\"\"\""]
["09:39,860","09:43,540","\"But then he says like \"\"Man, he was so excited when he invented it.\"\"\""]
