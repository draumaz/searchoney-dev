["04:18,980","04:22,020","\"Why don't they use julio white?\""]

["04:22,520","04:27,060","\"That is some snazzy animation.\""]
["04:27,060","04:28,280","\"Hot dog.\""]
["04:28,280","04:29,120","\"How do they do that?\""]
["04:29,120","04:30,720","\"I'm legitimately impressed.\""]
["04:30,720","04:32,220","\"This is a fan game.\""]
["04:32,220","04:34,520","\"This is a better fucking game than any.\""]
["04:34,520","04:35,620","\"I don't know if they've ever done it.\""]
["04:35,620","04:36,720","\"You don't know that yet.\""]
["04:36,720","04:37,720","\"We haven't gotten in.\""]
["04:37,720","04:38,420","\"It's true.\""]
["04:38,420","04:40,660","\"It just looks insanely impressive.\""]

["04:46,980","04:51,420","\"Follow me. I'm sorry should I not not like no\""]
["04:51,420","04:57,500","\"It said I can choose sonic and tails or sonic entails or knuckles. What about sonic and knuckles or tails and knuckles?\""]
["04:57,500","05:02,780","\"They're trying to do it very traditional because in Sonic 3 you could have sonic entails like Sonic 2\""]
["05:02,780","05:04,940","\"What does that mean? Does it just you switch back?\""]
["05:04,940","05:09,640","\"It's just kind of there. Oh, I'll do the song details you it feels more like I've got my friend\""]
["05:10,260","05:12,260","\"This is really holy\""]
["05:12,260","05:16,420","\"This is really nice looking it controls perfect too\""]
["05:16,420","05:18,900","\"No way\""]
["05:18,900","05:20,900","\"How do I jump? How do I bump?\""]
["05:20,900","05:27,540","\"No, it's right bumper. I don't I don't know how to communicate how impressed I am and how this looks\""]
["05:27,540","05:31,900","\"I know right. Hey stop. I don't even like Sonic. I\""]
["05:31,900","05:35,140","\"Do I like Sonic?\""]
["05:35,140","05:37,700","\"But this is a this has been development since\""]
["05:38,140","05:45,140","\"98 can you believe it this looks more real than actual Sonic games more real yeah like this looks more like a\""]
["05:45,140","05:52,780","\"Sonic game than like adventure or Sonic 06 because it's trying to show the headshot trying to stay true to the original material\""]
["05:52,780","05:55,440","\"And everything can you do the light dash can he follow a trail?\""]
["05:55,440","06:01,780","\"I'm not sure what yeah, what do you know in the last time I played this was whoa when I was still in school\""]
["06:01,780","06:07,700","\"You played like grade school or what when I was I think I was in middle school when I played this last\""]
["06:07,700","06:13,660","\"So this has been development for ages and seeing how far it's come is really really really impressive\""]
["06:13,660","06:18,580","\"Just all the effort that went into it. So how long until second? Oh, that's awesome\""]
["06:18,580","06:25,000","\"Doesn't seem to be stingy about that anymore the last time I remember them caring about that kind of thing was\""]
["06:25,000","06:31,200","\"Streets of rage remake or whatever is called, which was too bad. That was really a shame, but didn't they hire those guys\""]
["06:31,200","06:36,180","\"I I think Sega has really loosened up and it's good. They're cool about fan games\""]
["06:36,180","06:38,960","\"I like these little scrubbing bubbles robots\""]
["06:38,960","06:41,860","\"This is really cool. Holy shit\""]
["06:41,860","06:46,820","\"They have the option to even toggle the 3d models if you want to although I prefer these yeah\""]
["06:46,820","06:53,420","\"Right, that's way nicer. They look really nice. There's so much a effort poured into this. It's crazy\""]
["06:53,420","06:57,020","\"Like how many frames of animation is this already? I?\""]
["06:57,020","06:59,700","\"Mean they had to do it for every single\""]
["07:00,900","07:02,820","\"- I made a animation from every angle.\""]
["07:02,820","07:05,100","\"- The last time I played it, Knuckles wasn't done\""]
["07:05,100","07:08,980","\"and they had weird photos of him and Sonic Adventure.\""]
["07:08,980","07:10,500","\"Really, the limited palette.\""]
["07:10,500","07:11,340","\"- That's funny.\""]
["07:11,340","07:12,540","\"- They were still working on all the assets.\""]
["07:12,540","07:13,380","\"- Oh my God.\""]
["07:13,380","07:15,220","\"- That's why it's crazy to see this all done too\""]
["07:15,220","07:16,060","\"because oh my God.\""]
["07:16,060","07:17,780","\"- So this is done, it's great.\""]
["07:17,780","07:20,100","\"- I don't know if it's like final version,\""]
["07:20,100","07:23,580","\"but it's insanely polished up after all the years now.\""]
["07:23,580","07:26,020","\"- Did you say this was a doom?\""]
["07:26,020","07:28,500","\"- Yeah, this is off of a specific doom engine.\""]
["07:28,500","07:29,340","\"I forget which one it is.\""]
["07:29,340","07:33,080","\"Even just the frame rate like it's not slowing down or anything\""]
["07:33,080","07:39,800","\"Fuck be careful with it. Oh there we go. Sonic is capable of incredible\""]
["07:39,800","07:46,340","\"Power feats. Okay, so is that a lock on or is it just to go fast? I think you can lock down enemies in front of you\""]
["07:46,340","07:48,340","\"I did it. Oh\""]
["07:48,340","07:51,320","\"Wow\""]
["07:51,320","07:52,820","\"Oh\""]
["07:52,820","07:57,760","\"I remember that MIDI so what is the fault? What is the through line between this and the old version?\""]
["07:58,980","08:03,800","\"Much more polished visually, but like what do they have a little bit better? What do they have in common?\""]
["08:03,800","08:06,040","\"What do you mean share the same name? Oh?\""]
["08:06,040","08:12,280","\"I'm very confused now. Do you mean compared to Roboblast one? Yeah? Oh, I thought you meant like older versions\""]
["08:12,280","08:14,800","\"Like it's just a continued story. Yeah, it's just a continued thing\""]
["08:14,800","08:19,240","\"They should honestly not they shouldn't call it Roboblast to just think of it\""]
["08:19,240","08:22,960","\"I kind of appreciated just because they're recognizing they started with a click\""]
["08:23,760","08:27,640","\"You ended up treat the the the basic old one as camera\""]
["08:27,640","08:33,440","\"That's still so crazy to me that they stuck with this for all this time and they ended up with such an amazing result\""]
["08:33,440","08:37,960","\"Thanks to it seeing them grow up as they're making these games. How's they all?\""]
["08:37,960","08:46,000","\"I wonder I don't know I would know what was it Sonic Team Jr. I don't know the full extent but uh\""]
["08:46,000","08:49,600","\"It's cute they kept that you really might get sued\""]
["08:49,600","08:54,160","\"I remember playing Sonic Robo Blast 1 when I was younger just because I played a lot of those click and play fan games\""]
["08:54,160","08:58,480","\"So getting to see this was already amazing back then and seeing where it's ended up\""]
["08:58,480","08:59,800","\"I\""]
["08:59,800","09:04,720","\"Just can't believe it. Oh, I came this far. Oh, fully this part seems kind of tricky. You can do it Chris\""]
["09:04,720","09:08,280","\"And that's annoying. Here we go. There you go. Yeah. Oh\""]
["09:08,280","09:13,440","\"Fancy by the way 3D Sonic can be fun. I\""]
["09:13,440","09:17,600","\"Remember this song cuz\""]
["09:17,600","09:21,600","\"I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here.\""]
["09:21,600","09:22,600","\"- They're running fast.\""]
["09:22,600","09:23,600","\"- It's just the wrong way.\""]
["09:23,600","09:25,600","\"- Yeah, I think he turned around completely.\""]
["09:25,600","09:26,600","\"- Did he?\""]
["09:26,600","09:28,600","\"- Yeah, why don't you just keep proceeding through there?\""]
["09:28,600","09:29,600","\"- I'm trying.\""]
["09:29,600","09:30,600","\"I don't know how to get up.\""]

["09:56,320","09:59,320","\"does it I remember the way these maps used to work is that you had to double\""]
["09:59,320","10:03,520","\"up the walls because since Sonic went so fast he could potentially clip through\""]
["10:03,520","10:06,640","\"the walls oh really but I think they might have fixed that as time is going on\""]
["10:06,640","10:11,680","\"here they've modified doesn't seem very buggy it seems like it's a son of a\""]
["10:11,680","10:12,680","\"You can miss seeing that comment.\""]
["10:12,680","10:16,520","\"There's a lot they can get out of this now compared to back then.\""]

["10:27,640","10:28,640","\"Doom?\""]
["10:28,640","10:31,240","\"You also ran pretty fast in that, so it's kind of a fitting thing here.\""]
["10:31,240","10:32,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:32,240","10:35,440","\"Oh man, this is so cool.\""]

["11:38,200","11:43,200","\"Forces they were hoping that was gonna be the big success mania it was kind of unexpected to be the success\""]
["11:43,200","11:48,900","\"But of course it turned out great cuz fans worked on it. Yeah, I figured that would have been safe that you could jump over the laser\""]
["11:48,900","11:54,200","\"Sonic fans are crazy passionate and they can make really high quality stuff\""]
["11:54,200","11:57,480","\"It's because he's just so likable any look at this little guy look at that\""]
["11:57,480","11:59,880","\"I think it works best when he's in this world\""]
["11:59,880","12:05,080","\"When it's like it shoot him whoa you can look around when it's abstracting cartoony\""]
["12:05,080","12:07,440","\"I think that's when sonic works you can go to do mode\""]
["12:07,440","12:09,440","\"This is insane\""]
["12:09,440","12:17,880","\"Look at these dancing flowers. Oh, okay, you're saving screen shots. Thank you. Am I really yeah, you just did it repeated\""]
["12:17,880","12:19,880","\"Yep, you're still doing it\""]
["12:19,880","12:23,760","\"It's good to be back make a gift out of them and play it on screen right now\""]
["12:23,760","12:26,080","\"Whoa\""]
["12:26,080","12:28,080","\"They even got that\""]
["12:28,080","12:31,240","\"The last thing he ever saw\""]
["12:31,240","12:37,280","\"This is so freaking cool. Also the music it's fucking yeah, no the music's really good\""]
["12:37,280","12:39,280","\"And it's super fitting too\""]
["12:39,280","12:46,800","\"Like this one specifically how it sounds it reminds me of like the OVA the Sonic OVA just around that time period\""]
["12:46,800","12:48,120","\"Oh my god, you're right\""]
["12:48,120","12:50,120","\"Yeah, I can feel it\""]
["12:50,120","12:53,460","\"We've watched that a couple of times. I love that the door where he's like\""]
["12:53,460","12:55,080","\"Strange\""]
["12:55,080","13:00,640","\"Yeah, I'm not a VHS. I I had that as a kid. I wish I had that at least kid. I would have loved it\""]
["13:00,640","13:05,680","\"I liked it a lot. I remember as a kid. It doesn't obviously like hold up too strongly now\""]
["13:05,680","13:12,360","\"I think it's still pretty I love the bitchy princess. She's a lot of fun. Ah, she's a good character. She's a lot of fun\""]
["13:12,360","13:20,500","\"But yeah, that was originally like a little OVA and I would imagine that was probably like a pitch for a show or something\""]
["13:20,500","13:23,160","\"Oh, it would have worked. I think it was fun. Oh\""]
["13:23,160","13:30,120","\"You float on this had a decent soundtrack. It was nicely animated at points. It's using his CD design\""]
["13:30,120","13:32,120","\"Which I think is his best one\""]
["13:32,120","13:39,320","\"This is an interesting area. It sure is isn't it? I've been looking forward to you know every game has got to open on Green Hill Zone\""]
["13:39,320","13:41,320","\"I've been looking forward to like okay. What's there?\""]
["13:41,320","13:49,540","\"I'm really interesting ideas with some of these stages. I mean is this a shield what's happening here? Yeah, I think that's a shield\""]
["13:49,540","13:56,400","\"No, this is so crazy to see too because I do remember the stage like the early version of this map when I was younger\""]
["13:56,400","14:00,400","\"It was a lot harder to navigate. It looks like they cleaned it up a lot more\""]
["14:00,400","14:04,400","\"school you just have tails follow you around to\""]
["14:04,400","14:07,400","\"yeah I wonder is uh\""]
["14:07,400","14:11,400","\"is co-op I think it is possible actually no you can do co-op\""]
["14:11,400","14:14,800","\"this is the perfect game I'd be laying co-op I'm not sure if you can do\""]
["14:14,800","14:18,400","\"split screen I should look into it well because yeah they've done a lot since\""]
["14:18,400","14:21,800","\"I first played it I was really young when I first played this\""]
["14:21,800","14:24,800","\"wow scary this is fun\""]
["14:24,800","14:29,400","\"this is the exact kind of freaking game I like also that perspective when you\""]
["14:29,400","14:33,080","\"You just made that jump and made it feel that much better just because you could see\""]
["14:33,080","14:36,640","\"how much was ahead of you and how fast you were going.\""]
["14:36,640","14:38,920","\"It feels very, very good.\""]
["14:38,920","14:41,120","\"Watch out for the Robs.\""]
["14:41,120","14:42,640","\"Oh fuck.\""]
["14:42,640","14:44,880","\"Decent enemy designs here too.\""]
["14:44,880","14:45,880","\"Everything feels real.\""]
["14:45,880","14:48,080","\"It feels like official.\""]
["14:48,080","14:49,480","\"I know what you mean.\""]
["14:49,480","14:50,960","\"Yeah, look at that.\""]
["14:50,960","14:55,400","\"If Sega was really putting a lot of effort at the time to making a PC Sonic game, they\""]
["14:55,400","14:58,440","\"probably would have ended up like something like this.\""]
["14:58,440","15:01,940","\"But now with this much polish obviously, this much polish is possible through years and\""]
["15:01,940","15:04,680","\"years and years of hard work and fans just really sticking to it.\""]
["15:04,680","15:07,320","\"So has this really been worked on for like how long?\""]
["15:07,320","15:10,320","\"1998 I think is really started.\""]
["15:10,320","15:11,880","\"It was really really really old.\""]
["15:11,880","15:15,560","\"Like I said, I was growing up at the time when I was first playing this.\""]
["15:15,560","15:17,960","\"So it's crazy to see where it's gone.\""]
["15:17,960","15:21,320","\"And I'm glad there's still so much support around it and everything too, especially after\""]
["15:21,320","15:23,040","\"a lot of these recent builds.\""]
["15:23,040","15:24,240","\"I love that fire effect.\""]
["15:24,240","15:26,920","\"Do you think oddity will be the same way?\""]
["15:26,920","15:27,920","\"What's oddity?\""]
["15:27,920","15:30,080","\"That's the mother four thing.\""]
["15:30,080","15:34,680","\"Do you think we're gonna be like 40 or 50?\""]
["15:34,680","15:39,040","\"- I wonder what they were gonna release at the summer.\""]
["15:39,040","15:40,680","\"- I wonder what that one's gonna be like.\""]
["15:40,680","15:43,640","\"I don't mind people putting a lot of effort in\""]
["15:43,640","15:45,720","\"for something like that if you get an insane pop.\""]
["15:45,720","15:46,800","\"- Why would you?\""]
["15:46,800","15:47,640","\"- Yeah.\""]
["15:47,640","15:52,640","\"- 'Cause, like I said, this is still just crazy to take in\""]
["15:52,640","15:54,200","\"that this is how far it's come.\""]
["15:54,200","15:55,880","\"Oh, I remember this part.\""]
["15:55,880","15:57,240","\"- These pipes are fun.\""]
["15:57,240","15:59,240","\"This is clever.\""]
["15:59,240","16:12,240","\"I wonder if it still has that boss in this because speaking of the OVA, I remember they had the one robot from it and this is a boss at one point.\""]
["16:12,240","16:15,240","\"Oh, the one that he has to fight in the city.\""]
["16:15,240","16:17,240","\"Yeah, the one that he fights in the city.\""]
["16:17,240","16:20,240","\"So there's a lot of love in here too for Sonic fans.\""]
["16:20,240","16:23,240","\"Specifically, if you were a Sonic fan around 1998.\""]
["16:23,240","16:30,260","\"Yeah, I only ever had one as a kid and then I my next Sonic game was adventure to battle so I missed out on all of the in-between ones\""]
["16:30,260","16:37,080","\"It's always interesting to hear about it now as a franchise to because it doesn't seem to be a thing where people really knew\""]
["16:37,080","16:41,860","\"Where it was at or like what the appeal was because to me the appeal of Sonic was always like the physics the speed\""]
["16:41,860","16:46,040","\"I mean, I think that's the problem is that Sega doesn't know what the appeal of Sonic is\""]
["16:46,040","16:48,320","\"It doesn't seem like a lot of the audience does either\""]
["16:48,800","16:55,560","\"So it's all over the place from like every angle. Yeah, it's hard for anyone to figure out what to really do. That was interesting\""]
["16:55,560","17:02,300","\"But that's what's cool about this is they still try to maintain a bit of like sonic style physics\""]
["17:02,300","17:06,360","\"There's slopes and everything in here, but there's also a lot of just stage design really\""]
["17:06,360","17:10,240","\"functioning around speed the moment feels way better -\""]
["17:10,240","17:16,100","\"Because it doesn't take so long to slow down. Yeah, you you accelerate pretty quick in this\""]
["17:17,160","17:21,320","\"They got a little and reach celebrate pretty quickly - let me up\""]
["17:21,320","17:25,040","\"You're not super slippery, which is good cuz this would be a lot harder\""]
["17:25,040","17:28,580","\"I feel like it might have been a little bit slippery when I played it last\""]
["17:28,580","17:35,480","\"But it looks like they tightened it up more which is nice. They tightened up the graphics on level 3. Mm-hmm with their controller in hand\""]
["17:35,480","17:37,480","\"I'm doing okay\""]
["17:37,480","17:43,520","\"Well, Chris did you ever see those commercials? I'm sure he did the what the game design college or whatever\""]
["17:43,520","17:47,120","\"No, it was a really old and it's two guys pretending to play a game\""]
["17:47,120","17:53,120","\"And they their boss comes in says hey, I need you guys to get on this and they go. Oh, yeah\""]
["17:53,120","17:55,520","\"We're just tightening up the graphics of level three\""]
["17:55,520","18:00,920","\"And what is it he turns the other one says I can't believe we get paid to do this\""]
["18:00,920","18:08,720","\"So shit, it's just them looking cool holding controllers playing a video game. That's what it's like making a game guys\""]
["18:08,720","18:11,120","\"Not agonizing pain whatsoever\""]
["18:11,880","18:14,180","\"It's not the most soul crushing annoying\""]
["18:14,180","18:22,120","\"Unthankful job ever no since you've done both of your experiences seem to be negative. I does not enjoy working on games\""]
["18:22,120","18:27,720","\"No, I mean that what I was gonna ask Chris. I'm working on it. I don't enjoy people thinking that it's easy that it's fun\""]
["18:27,720","18:31,120","\"Oh, well, that's just your exposure to the gaming world. That's what it is\""]
["18:31,120","18:37,700","\"Chris would you say that being an animator or making games is is like more unpleasant?\""]
["18:38,600","18:42,120","\"Since you've done both making games cuz uh\""]
["18:42,120","18:46,240","\"Little tiny things can take so long and most people don't\""]
["18:46,240","18:54,280","\"I would say that's the biggest thing with games is that there's a lack of an understanding of what kind of work goes into it sometimes\""]
["18:54,280","18:57,360","\"I think you're supposed to go under water. Yeah, I gotta jump off this box. I\""]
["18:57,360","19:02,560","\"Can do this. Oh, there you go. Yeah, I'll do it. Hey\""]
["19:02,560","19:06,120","\"That solution was in the room\""]
["19:07,800","19:13,360","\"Oh, they have a good special stage in this too. They have it's just knights one for one\""]
["19:13,360","19:16,200","\"They just put knights in really as the special stage, which is pretty cool\""]
["19:16,200","19:22,880","\"You get to do it as supersonic and talk about the land wonderland. I haven't played the demo\""]
["19:22,880","19:26,120","\"So I have nothing to say. I'm not that interested never mind then\""]
["19:26,120","19:32,120","\"I would have been interested if they're doing more with it, but it looks like they're not really doing anything\""]
["19:32,120","19:35,480","\"It just looks like you're supposed to be into the visuals. I guess\""]
["19:36,720","19:38,720","\"That's too bad. I like knights\""]
["19:38,720","19:41,320","\"careful\""]
["19:41,320","19:44,920","\"I'm glad you can go so fast in this\""]
["19:44,920","19:50,700","\"I bet seeing like fast runs of these stages are really satisfying. Oh god\""]
["19:50,700","19:56,020","\"I bet like once you've memorized the layout. Yeah, I know exactly how to navigate them do like a speedrun\""]
["19:56,020","20:04,420","\"I mean, that's the satisfying elements. I was hoping he was gonna be flattened on the bottom. Oh, that was kind of harsh\""]
["20:05,520","20:08,920","\"Has this been out for long enough for there to be speedruns? Oh, I'm sure yeah\""]
["20:08,920","20:11,280","\"Okay\""]
["20:11,280","20:16,620","\"Didn't see that oopsie. Tisk Tisk. That was kind of my bad. They're your run run run\""]
["20:16,620","20:20,360","\"Holy this is scary sound\""]
["20:20,360","20:25,480","\"Do you like that Sega Genesis audio\""]
["20:25,480","20:31,660","\"Sound fonts and shit, I would assume I think that's a direct sound effect that they even used\""]
["20:32,400","20:39,920","\"I always was a fan though. I like I forget the name of the chip the Yamaha one but the Genesis uses I always like\""]
["20:39,920","20:52,000","\"Sonic shoes oh\""]
["20:52,000","20:55,240","\"You gotta be lined up with those okay, okay\""]
["20:55,240","20:58,160","\"At least the rings are really good about guiding where you need to go\""]
["20:58,160","21:01,000","\"I kind of want to see what the 3d models look like it's a\""]
["21:02,000","21:08,540","\"No, you can I'm on the fly on the fly. That's pretty impressive. They did that really you don't see that too often\""]
["21:08,540","21:10,540","\"So where it's under video options? Oh?\""]
["21:10,540","21:13,520","\"Down\""]
["21:13,520","21:17,320","\"At least it should be I remember open GL options. Yep\""]
["21:17,320","21:24,880","\"Wow, look at that. Oh, he's adorable. Yeah, that's a nice low-poly model\""]
["21:24,880","21:28,680","\"Yeah, I wanna I wanna put him low-poly - I want to hug him and pierce my eye\""]
["21:28,680","21:35,980","\"I can I can pretend this was the Sega Saturn Sonic we never got let me out of here. Oh God. Let me out of here\""]
["21:35,980","21:37,980","\"Not allowed. Oh, okay. We're good. I\""]
["21:37,980","21:41,280","\"I like seeing this character rendered low-poly\""]
["21:41,280","21:45,520","\"Because it works you pointy. Yeah, I was lucky was meant for it. Holy shit\""]
["21:45,520","21:48,000","\"I know he never really got to do it. I know\""]
["21:48,000","21:54,760","\"There was Sonic of the fighters. There was Sonic Jam. I feel like those were two of the only times I could you know what?\""]
["21:55,400","22:01,720","\"Sonic 3D Blast also had a 3D. Okay, that was weird. Why didn't bonus stage only on the Saturn\""]
["22:01,720","22:03,220","\"Why didn't it put you where you needed to go?\""]
["22:03,220","22:09,580","\"Those are the only times I can really think of I guess Sonic are there's the obvious one. I wonder if maybe he can do a butt bounce\""]
["22:09,580","22:13,180","\"Because it seems like that's the only way to stop your momentum\""]
["22:13,180","22:17,500","\"Maybe I just gotta you gotta do it yourself all look even the enemies are 3d now\""]
["22:17,500","22:22,920","\"So am I supposed to go this way? Yeah, everything that was 2d now becomes 3d amazing\""]
["22:23,560","22:28,280","\"Well, fuck it's neat. They have that as a feature. I really wasn't expecting it\""]
["22:28,280","22:34,360","\"I love how the 2d looks though all the effort when I would prefer but this still looks really good\""]
["22:34,360","22:38,480","\"And I get wanting this because at least then you have a better sense of what direction you're facing\""]
["22:38,480","22:43,520","\"You're gonna do it with the with doom and how it works. You only can face eight different directions\""]
["22:43,520","22:45,600","\"So how do they put a 3d model in doom?\""]
["22:45,600","22:51,800","\"Well, it's not just doom. It's a modified version of doom. Oh, so this is under the open GL menu\""]
["22:52,120","22:57,060","\"So it's rendering differently. I don't know what any of those words mean, but that sure sounds impressive\""]
["22:57,060","23:00,620","\"That's somebody fancy words for Sonic\""]
["23:00,620","23:07,500","\"So it doesn't know what any of that means I'm doing it. I'm progressing. He's just a little tiny blue almost\""]
["23:07,500","23:09,500","\"I'm a spy mouse. I'm hungry\""]
["23:09,500","23:12,100","\"an horny\""]

["23:14,540","23:20,900","\"That's animals all right. Hey, here's my impression of an animal. Do I'm hungry and horny\""]
["23:21,620","23:23,620","\"You still like an animal\""]
["23:23,620","23:32,200","\"Okay, what was that about there's rings really you got them very good I\""]
["23:32,200","23:35,320","\"Like even a checkpoint 3d\""]
["23:35,320","23:41,080","\"This is a long fucking level it is I remember it being a long one\""]
["23:41,080","23:48,020","\"But you know what that means this game is jam-packed full of content how long is it?\""]
["23:48,740","23:55,300","\"I forget how many stages they have now when I last played it. It was only like five or something. It's gone up a lot\""]
["23:55,300","23:58,660","\"Yeah, I mean\""]
["23:58,660","24:02,860","\"I don't know how many secrets there are too because there were secret maps in this too\""]
["24:02,860","24:05,660","\"There were lots of a lot of things\""]
["24:05,660","24:12,460","\"Which is neat. I remember they had like a Christmas area that you could find as a secret. Can you see say it?\""]
["24:12,460","24:15,260","\"No, Tails died\""]
["24:15,260","24:18,500","\"In real life\""]

["24:27,500","24:28,500","\"- I did. - It was cute.\""]
["24:28,500","24:29,500","\"They gave him a little animation.\""]

["24:33,500","24:35,500","\"I would have played the heck out of it.\""]
["24:35,500","24:38,500","\"To be fair, I did play the original build a lot,\""]
["24:38,500","24:39,500","\"the one that I had at the time.\""]

["44:38,000","44:44,520","\"This is a better stage layout than what I remembered it being to they might have improved it. Oh, they definitely did a lot of this stuff\""]
["44:44,520","44:52,160","\"Wasn't there originally oh something shooting at you be careful. They're like giant egg man shields with all nights pushing them over there\""]

["45:48,520","45:53,560","\"learning I just need to know the layout of all the better I've got I'm\""]
["45:53,560","45:57,420","\"legitimately scared like is this level so big yeah you have to jump so\""]
["45:57,420","46:03,520","\"dangerous it is I like the stage though this is cool even if I'm not very good\""]
["46:03,520","46:08,480","\"at it I'm having a really fun time what do you think of this castle Chris I\""]

["46:26,080","46:28,240","\"It's not automated like a lot of 3D sonics.\""]
