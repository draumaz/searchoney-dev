["01:22,820","01:29,820","\"So what do the gamers say? Is this one of the best Spider-Man games?\""]
["01:29,820","01:31,820","\"This is the best Spider-Man game.\""]
["01:31,820","01:34,820","\"How have they on top of it since then?\""]
["01:34,820","01:36,820","\"Because of the camera camera.\""]
["01:36,820","01:38,820","\"Or on air pretty much.\""]
["01:38,820","01:43,820","\"By the way, Toby Maguire is completely emotionally checked out of this game.\""]
["01:43,820","01:44,820","\"I love this game.\""]
["01:44,820","01:45,820","\"That's what makes it so good.\""]
["01:45,820","01:50,820","\"Can I say, I still think Toby Maguire is the best Peter Parker.\""]
["01:50,820","01:56,680","\"You think so I think so I think you guys okay Andrew Garifield I thought he was the worst Andrew Garifield yeah\""]

["02:13,940","02:18,780","\"I think I like him. He's fine. I think he's the best balance. I think I think Andrew Garfield was a good spider-man\""]
["02:18,780","02:23,740","\"But a bad Peter Parker. I think I'm clear. I bet Peter told me a lot is Peter Parker\""]
["02:23,740","02:25,740","\"This looks like a big fucking sack of mashed potatoes\""]
["02:25,740","02:32,300","\"I feel like it's really hard to judge the the new Peter Parker because that that fucking movie just never shuts up\""]
["02:32,300","02:40,140","\"Yeah, nice spec maps nice traps nice trap muscles, dude. Oh, wow. This does not feel like spider-man actually Wow\""]

["05:00,360","05:05,540","\"I would love to see this game updated with like kind of GTA stuff where you can fucking stop people in the eye\""]
["05:05,540","05:10,740","\"I actually don't feel like the combat in this game plays that's hard. Oh, I think it's shit. Oh, do you?\""]
