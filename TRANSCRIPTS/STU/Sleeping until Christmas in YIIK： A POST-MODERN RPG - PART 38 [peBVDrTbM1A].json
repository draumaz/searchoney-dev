["03:14,000","03:18,560","\"There is a lot of things in this game that are just very final fantasy 7 well\""]
["03:18,560","03:23,840","\"It's also so much of this game is just kind of phony with its game references. Why do you think it does it so much?\""]
["03:23,840","03:27,880","\"I don't know you didn't have to do it because it's the popular thing these days you get it\""]
["03:27,880","03:33,000","\"Yeah, I guess I'm has to reference other videos green shot and go you won't believe what's in this crazy\""]

["03:45,480","03:49,280","\"Yeah, why don't we supposed to fill don't you want to do something? Okay?\""]
["03:49,280","03:52,820","\"I guess they could tell that we ran out of things to do\""]
["03:52,820","04:01,320","\"Day would dawn and I would repeat my alternation of spending time with my friends and holding my powers in mind dungeon holding my power\""]
["04:01,320","04:05,520","\"Even with all my friends with me every now and then I would feel a violent staff\""]
["04:05,520","04:09,640","\"a very watery drink a very airy breathe\""]
["04:10,560","04:15,200","\"Why that sure is what it feels like to play this game.\""]
["04:15,200","04:16,200","\"That's right.\""]
["04:16,200","04:20,160","\"Yeah, no drinking and breathing sure feels like you're being stabbed with long needles.\""]
["04:20,160","04:23,880","\"I could hear the roots of loneliness creeping through me when the world was hushed at four\""]
["04:23,880","04:25,400","\"o'clock in the morning.\""]
["04:25,400","04:26,880","\"Christmas was coming.\""]
["04:26,880","04:30,600","\"And then, in a few days, the world might end.\""]
["04:30,600","04:32,040","\"Could I really be the end?\""]
["04:32,040","04:34,520","\"I'm starting to love the world so much.\""]
["04:34,520","04:37,520","\"For all of my friends, my mom, even my sister.\""]
["04:37,520","04:40,800","\"I found out it was my fault and maybe appreciate the world a lot more.\""]
["04:40,800","04:42,800","\"How easily they could be lost.\""]
["04:42,800","04:43,880","\"Yeah, wake up.\""]
["04:43,880","04:46,400","\"You spoil a little brat.\""]
["04:46,400","04:50,880","\"Your final fantasy seven ain't going to save you now.\""]

["04:52,880","04:53,880","\"Still.\""]
["04:53,880","04:54,880","\"Why?\""]
["04:54,880","04:55,880","\"Seriously.\""]
["04:55,880","04:56,880","\"What are we supposed to do now?\""]
["04:56,880","04:57,880","\"Why?\""]
["04:57,880","05:00,040","\"Why did he put that reference in?\""]
["05:00,040","05:01,360","\"There's nothing left for us to do.\""]
["05:01,360","05:02,360","\"No, there's nothing left.\""]
["05:02,360","05:07,360","\"They're actually going to make us go in and out of his door 15 times.\""]
["05:07,360","05:13,480","\"You could go into the mind dungeon and exit over and over that might be faster\""]
["05:13,480","05:22,120","\"Things are changing outside\""]
["05:22,120","05:27,480","\"What what?\""]
["05:27,480","05:32,400","\"What you're in what's happening?\""]
["05:32,400","05:38,480","\"That is just keep doing it. It's faster. Yeah, it's the fastest way. I talked to my bed. Okay, okay\""]
["05:38,480","05:44,900","\"I think it's giving you the option from the door because it was the last thing you were looking at and it's just saving it and\""]
["05:44,900","05:47,500","\"Letting you do it over and over maybe put a hitbox in the bed\""]
["05:47,500","05:51,700","\"Who knows because I think I remember that if you move it drops the prompt for it\""]
["05:51,700","05:56,740","\"But I think it's keeping the prompt from the doorway and it's just not going away because you haven't walked yet\""]
["05:56,740","05:59,580","\"I love how every glitch in this game just rocks\""]
["06:00,500","06:05,320","\"Like we we haven't been yeah, they make the game better the only place that sucked was when it locked the game\""]
["06:05,320","06:12,100","\"Well, you have a soft like with bad that that kind of stunk, but skipping the dungeon was great skipping. This is pretty nice. I\""]
["06:12,100","06:14,760","\"Mean I would like to skip all of it\""]
["06:14,760","06:18,960","\"That'd be nice. There should be an option that says it. Do you want to sleep in bed for two weeks?\""]
["06:18,960","06:26,820","\"And then parentheses it says don't worry. It's really on like in consequential if you did anything else. I'm sad\""]
["06:29,020","06:36,100","\"It's almost Christmas. I'm bummed because they clearly left all this time for you to like finish everything up\""]
["06:36,100","06:38,220","\"Where is your dad?\""]
["06:38,220","06:44,960","\"Now we're gonna persona it and give you the option to bond maybe have more opportunities to bond and more meaningful conversations\""]
["06:44,960","06:47,600","\"Then it's not anime cool in another you\""]
["06:47,600","06:52,260","\"She didn't say is the sky a different color. She said the Sun\""]
["06:52,260","06:57,940","\"But I did say sky different colors, so they asked that too. We got all the worthless questions out there Chris\""]
["06:57,940","07:02,780","\"Okay, while we're doing this come up with come up with conversations that they had just imagine them\""]
["07:02,780","07:06,780","\"Rory asks Alex why did you kiss me back there?\""]
["07:06,780","07:11,060","\"Goes I don't know. It's because you guys on the internet\""]

["07:21,900","07:24,700","\"I set up in the bed and felt for my panda.\""]
["07:24,700","07:25,700","\"He was still asleep.\""]
["07:25,700","07:26,700","\"He slept more soon.\""]

["07:28,700","07:30,700","\"I sat still and listened hard.\""]
["07:30,700","07:34,700","\"But the only sound I could hear was the faint dry thumping of my own heart.\""]
["07:34,700","07:35,700","\"Dry thumping?\""]
["07:35,700","07:36,700","\"Months ago.\""]
["07:36,700","07:38,700","\"I hated when my heart raced.\""]
["07:38,700","07:44,100","\"It either meant I was nervous or I had been forced to exercise against my will.\""]
["07:44,100","07:45,100","\"I didn't think about that.\""]
["07:45,100","07:50,420","\"With all the time I've spent training in the mind dungeon everything feels clear my mind my muscles\""]
["07:50,420","07:56,060","\"Everything made sense. I needed to sleep for another two weeks straight. That's when I could feel my heartbeat\""]

["15:01,820","15:04,460","\"That is kind of weird\""]

["15:10,400","15:12,260","\"Okay, it seems like nothing's changed\""]
["15:12,260","15:18,860","\"So let's just go back and then I said Chrono Trigger was my childhood memory when literally that game came out four years ago\""]
["15:18,860","15:20,860","\"and I I\""]
["15:21,620","15:22,620","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["15:22,620","15:26,500","\"Forget about that.\""]
["15:26,500","15:28,340","\"Everybody's depressed, which is what I figured it would be.\""]
["15:28,340","15:34,260","\"I mean, at least they did the new dialogue, but it just feels like nothing's different.\""]
["15:34,260","15:35,260","\"No, not really.\""]
["15:35,260","15:37,540","\"Just the dialogues been swapped.\""]
["15:37,540","15:40,740","\"Everybody will make a comment about if the world ended, I'd be okay with it.\""]
["15:40,740","15:41,740","\"But you know what?\""]
["15:41,740","15:42,740","\"At least that's something.\""]
["15:42,740","15:45,340","\"I really thought it would be nothing.\""]
["15:45,340","15:48,100","\"But then again, did you care about any of these NPCs?\""]
["15:48,100","15:49,100","\"No.\""]
["15:49,100","15:51,380","\"Did you care about Ghostbusters reference club?\""]
["15:51,380","15:55,180","\"Yeah, and it works in Majora's Mask because the NPCs you actually care about after a while.\""]
["15:55,180","15:58,080","\"Yeah, you get to do quests with them and actually get to know them really well.\""]
["15:58,080","15:59,780","\"They have little storylines.\""]
["15:59,780","16:04,180","\"It's good that's there, obviously, that they change the dialogue, but it doesn't really matter.\""]
["16:04,180","16:05,880","\"You're not going to go check any of that.\""]
["16:05,880","16:07,380","\"What I would say is more important.\""]
["16:07,380","16:08,180","\"Yeah, it's cool.\""]
["16:08,180","16:10,980","\"I like that people would be depressed outside.\""]
["16:10,980","16:16,180","\"I remember being really impressed with Oracle of Ages does that, that by the end of the game,\""]
["16:16,180","16:18,780","\"like just everybody in town is like horribly sad.\""]
["16:18,780","16:19,580","\"Yeah, I love that.\""]
["16:19,580","16:20,380","\"But um...\""]
["16:20,380","16:26,380","\"I don't think it's gonna be like you said that like they're not gonna make a change to the dialogue every single day.\""]
["16:26,380","16:27,280","\"The door is open.\""]
["16:27,280","16:28,280","\"Oh look at that!\""]
["16:28,280","16:30,180","\"This is it. The big moment we've all been waiting for.\""]
