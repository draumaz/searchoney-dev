["06:55,980","07:01,820","\"Like it probably wouldn't hurt as bad and I would just be really really angry after it happened\""]
["07:01,820","07:06,540","\"I don't have any magic. I feel like if I ever got in a fight with a guy who like you know\""]
["07:06,540","07:09,640","\"Was just like an adult who attended like a Taekwondo\""]
["07:09,640","07:12,500","\"like studio\""]
["07:12,500","07:13,400","\"I\""]
["07:13,400","07:18,700","\"Would want to beat him to a pulp just at a principal because he'd be doing all these little flips and high jump kicks\""]
["07:18,700","07:23,980","\"He would he would assume like a june B stance and you just fucking kick him in the scrot. Yeah, probably\""]
["07:23,980","07:28,740","\"And I was really into martial arts as a kid and I\""]
["07:29,500","07:34,300","\"I feel like aside from the people who are really good at them, they're all kind of bullshit.\""]
["07:34,300","07:44,200","\"Yeah, there is a guy in, I want to say it's China, that he's kind of like a, or I guess he's a professional fighter now,\""]
["07:44,200","07:47,900","\"but he was just sort of a mid-level MMA fighter.\""]
["07:47,900","07:54,900","\"And he was challenging all these Tai Chi guys, he was like, \"\"Hey, Tai Chi is not really like a method of self-defense.\"\"\""]
["07:54,900","08:00,060","\"And he started challenging all these Tai Chi masters to fight and just beating the fuck out of them\""]
["08:00,060","08:02,760","\"I love the idea of like a dojo destroyer\""]
["08:02,760","08:08,060","\"Yeah, no, he was he was just trying to kind of prove a point and they really because it's China\""]
["08:08,060","08:12,960","\"They really tried to like fuck with him. There's there's like a lot of videos and stuff on this\""]
["08:12,960","08:16,460","\"So I don't want to just recite coming up thing like way more interesting\""]
["08:16,460","08:23,060","\"But basically they they were like oh, yeah, you can't fight unless you paint your face like a snowman and\""]
["08:23,460","08:28,740","\"Call yourself the fat snowman or something like that or just some kind of equivalent and\""]
["08:28,740","08:33,580","\"Yeah, he won basically every fight he was in for like a three-year span\""]
["08:33,580","08:39,520","\"What did you just goes to show that yeah, it's like I don't think learning Tai Chi is gonna help you\""]
["08:39,520","08:46,540","\"Win a fight against the boxer and MMA fighter ever really anything physical is all about efficiency of movement, right?\""]
["08:46,540","08:51,820","\"So there's like a specific Tai Chi kick that requires you to spin around 180 degrees\""]
["08:51,940","08:57,300","\"There's almost always a better solution to that also that thing looks like a nutsack at the bottom there\""]
["08:57,300","09:01,460","\"True true\""]
["09:01,460","09:04,780","\"You mean you know oh\""]
["09:04,780","09:07,840","\"mean squingle you got to go chicken versus chicken\""]

["09:10,340","09:12,780","\"Malo on her arm. What is that?\""]
["09:12,780","09:17,260","\"So well, I don't know was for some reason the first thing that came to mind\""]
["09:17,260","09:21,100","\"I don't remember that either. This is the Mandela. It's like a big mood ring. Yeah that\""]
["09:21,620","09:27,640","\"Chikengi there might be some special edition bullshit going on right here where she just has like a meteorite\""]
["09:27,640","09:29,980","\"Bracer equipped or something for no reason no\""]
["09:29,980","09:37,380","\"I did actually see that this game has different models like their faces and stuff are different and in some cases much worse like\""]
["09:37,380","09:38,980","\"Titus's we say a balafore\""]
["09:38,980","09:43,780","\"Yeah, this is cicangi now, and she's friends with it. I love you cicangi the war\""]
["09:43,780","09:48,720","\"But if you look at the original Titus's face looks a little better than the one in this one\""]
["09:48,720","09:53,720","\"Use their sonic wings. Okay. You're mighty sonic way\""]
["09:53,720","09:58,480","\"Look at those real-time shadows head to the end of the thing right once you get a summon out\""]
["09:58,480","10:00,480","\"It takes over the entire battlefield\""]
["10:00,480","10:06,360","\"But you can't get damage while it's out like only it can take the damage. Oh, yeah\""]
["10:06,360","10:09,640","\"That thing's stupid. It keeps me seeing\""]
["10:09,640","10:14,080","\"Dude, I can't believe we got a cockfight this early\""]
["10:15,840","10:22,400","\"Use the overdrive use it use our special rare blast. I don't remember actually which one we just got cooler alright\""]
["10:22,400","10:28,720","\"That's the default one. Oh you've seen the video of the lady who's just like I don't want to sit next to this baby\""]
["10:28,720","10:33,360","\"And then the air hose that's like you need to get off the flight. She's like no no and she's like give me your name\""]
["10:33,360","10:37,840","\"I want your name. She's like my name is Tabitha. She's like Tabitha. You may not have a job tomorrow\""]
["10:44,840","10:46,840","\"Yeah, I've seen that. I've definitely seen that video.\""]

["10:52,840","10:53,840","\"Oh, this is fucking cool.\""]
["10:53,840","10:56,840","\"How many times can you make chicken happen?\""]
["10:56,840","11:00,840","\"I hate it when these games acknowledge that you're doing something annoying.\""]
["11:00,840","11:04,840","\"I hate it. Final Fantasy Remake does it over and over.\""]
["11:04,840","11:06,840","\"Fuck you, game.\""]
["11:06,840","11:10,840","\"You inflicted darkness with your mighty ball.\""]

["11:15,840","11:20,860","\"Cool whoa that sucked I bet he misses\""]
["11:20,860","11:27,460","\"Did you know that in the original Final Fantasy 7 the the darkness thing doesn't fucking work on enemies?\""]
["11:27,460","11:35,740","\"Does it not no it shows you it does but it does yeah, it's just a bug it just doesn't fucking work and there's some like piece of equipment like\""]

["11:41,340","11:46,240","\"Wow, I didn't know the original game was that bugged there's a really good video on YouTube called a hundred things\""]
["11:46,240","11:50,400","\"You didn't know about Final Fantasy 7 and it's just like it just cycles through all this weird shit\""]
["11:50,400","11:52,840","\"It's all crazy. It's the most broken game ever\""]
["11:52,840","11:57,620","\"They have to pretty much ship it like just to keep it from like not falling apart\""]
["11:57,620","11:59,420","\"But it was so cutting edge at the time\""]
["11:59,420","12:00,780","\"It's it's like yeah\""]
["12:00,780","12:06,720","\"Do you know the marketing and the combined marketing and production budgets of the original F F 7 was 80 million dollars?\""]

["12:11,240","12:20,100","\"Jesus it's a work. Yeah, that probably if it did if it hadn't done that well like it wound up doing amazing and like\""]
["12:20,100","12:27,880","\"Brought like the JRPG into like the global spotlight, but had it not done well it probably would have like\""]
["12:27,880","12:35,320","\"Been like the tombstone for the Final Fantasy series that blows my mind how much money they put into it\""]
