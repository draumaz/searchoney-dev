["29:08,320","29:12,320","\"Chris, you know the story about how this game got made, right?\""]
["29:12,320","29:14,320","\"Me and Moto was warning.\""]
["29:14,320","29:18,320","\"They were working on the Ocarina time expansion, but then how Numa wanted to do something new.\""]
["29:18,320","29:22,320","\"So, Me and Moto said he could do something new, but only if he could make it in a year.\""]
["29:22,320","29:27,320","\"So, that's why this game recycles assets in a weird way.\""]
["29:27,320","29:29,320","\"It's a new dimension, but like...\""]
["29:29,320","29:31,320","\"Yeah, it's really creative with its concepts.\""]
["29:31,320","29:33,320","\"I recognize this music.\""]
["29:33,320","29:34,320","\"I love this song.\""]
["29:34,320","29:36,320","\"It's a really, really good song.\""]
["29:36,320","29:42,720","\"Yeah, I saw that one guy in Narrow's video about how they pretty much rushed out the game in a year\""]
["29:42,720","29:45,440","\"But because they rushed it out, that's why it's good. Yeah\""]
["29:45,440","29:49,220","\"And they were really creative with it and then when he went back to fix all of the little problems\""]
["29:49,220","29:54,460","\"He made it way worse. Oh the 3DS one's so horrible. I pity anybody's played that anyone honestly\""]
["29:54,460","29:57,400","\"I think we discussed this. Holy fuck that scary\""]
["29:57,400","30:02,120","\"Strange looking child. Are you a new friend of the bombers gang?\""]
["30:02,440","30:06,320","\"Your manners seem much better than those nasty little baby things\""]
["30:06,320","30:11,040","\"I hate them\""]
["30:11,040","30:15,960","\"Destructive bubbles and destroy them\""]

["30:39,820","30:44,040","\"model his hair model is stuck to his ears, but his head is going through his hair\""]
["30:44,040","30:48,960","\"What the hell he's bro he's balding perpetually. I don't think this game was meant to be viewed in HD\""]
["30:48,960","30:52,240","\"Giving me PTSD. Okay. Look at the moon. Oh\""]
["30:52,240","30:57,320","\"God, isn't it pretty no pretty cute\""]
["30:57,320","30:59,960","\"That's fucking scary\""]

["31:31,560","31:34,600","\"Okay\""]
["31:34,600","31:39,740","\"The scary moon is crying. Well, did you find that troublemaker? What was that loud noise?\""]
["31:39,740","31:42,520","\"A moon's tear has fallen\""]
["31:42,520","31:48,100","\"Just like in real life when the moon is sad it cries fucking flaming tears the destroy office building\""]
["31:48,100","31:54,720","\"It's weird. I was reading that like I guess when they were into making the game. They went to like their friend's wedding in like Korea\""]
["31:55,320","31:57,800","\"They're having a hard time with Japan so like\""]
["31:57,800","32:00,900","\"They drop this one here on the ear the wedding\""]
["32:00,900","32:05,680","\"So that's what the idea came from they're like they were celebrating happiness and like new life in a time\""]
["32:05,680","32:07,680","\"We're like they could have been blown into fucking smithereens\""]
["32:07,680","32:12,240","\"Really depressing game. That's so cool. That's really neat\""]
["32:12,240","32:17,920","\"Wow, that's kind of personal though for a moment. I know you don't even think about that in the game\""]
["32:17,920","32:19,920","\"You're just like why the fuck do I need a tear?\""]
["32:19,920","32:23,300","\"That's what I was like that's so cool\""]
["32:24,400","32:26,400","\"and tear\""]
["32:26,400","32:30,340","\"so I talk to him let's see what you just making a tear collection was your\""]
["32:30,340","32:32,340","\"tear-wrap bar\""]
["32:32,340","32:36,220","\"um okay thank you\""]
["32:36,220","32:41,860","\"that's fucking scary don't dance with him\""]
["32:41,860","32:47,440","\"he wants to pass time yeah well there's another way you can pass time it's\""]
["32:47,440","32:48,620","\"way more captivating\""]
["32:48,620","32:49,820","\"If I fucking someone?\""]
["32:49,820","32:51,220","\"Yeah.\""]
["32:51,220","32:53,120","\"Yes.\""]
["32:53,120","32:56,320","\"I don't like him.\""]
["32:56,320","32:59,020","\"Yeah, he's got quite the uncomfortable hand.\""]
["32:59,020","33:00,720","\"You can slow the flow of time.\""]
["33:00,720","33:04,320","\"You can move half a day forward.\""]
["33:04,320","33:05,820","\"Yeah.\""]
["33:05,820","33:06,720","\"Wow.\""]
["33:06,720","33:10,620","\"But I need to get my ocarina, right?\""]
["33:10,620","33:11,520","\"Yeah.\""]
["33:11,520","33:15,020","\"This is all kind of pointless, but it's kind of a hint for the future.\""]
["33:15,020","33:16,920","\"So I guess it is an entirely pointless.\""]
["33:16,920","33:18,120","\"That's cool.\""]
["33:18,320","33:22,720","\"Yeah, it's really cool. And that was something as a kid I didn't really understand and I was like stupid\""]
["33:22,720","33:25,920","\"But then when you do it you realize that you do have a lot of time. Yeah, no\""]
["33:25,920","33:30,960","\"Went once like every says that it's like nobody almost nobody who places knows that like yeah\""]
["33:30,960","33:36,800","\"Because with those two tricks you can do almost anything and it's very comfortable. I think yeah, it never feels unmanageable\""]
["33:36,800","33:40,560","\"So basically I think this is a good time for Dave to tell his story\""]
["33:40,560","33:44,800","\"It sucks, but a while ago me and Jeff's already going to the gym\""]
["33:44,800","33:49,360","\"So I just like loaded up on like infinite protein bars and like peanuts and all sorts of stuff\""]
["33:49,360","33:53,420","\"And ain't no vegetables and drank very little water and got massively\""]
["33:53,420","33:57,940","\"Concipated Phil like all sorts of stuff. Dave you had like a four-year-old sense of fucking losing weight\""]
["33:57,940","34:03,480","\"You were like I'm gonna gain muscles by eating protein. I was working. I gained a lot of weight\""]
["34:03,480","34:06,360","\"It was awesome, but then not being able to shoot is not awesome\""]
["34:06,360","34:08,440","\"What the hell Dave you fucking ruined the story?\""]
["34:08,440","34:14,160","\"Well, how's it ruined? You skipped ahead. There's so much to this story. I just remember seeing you\""]
["34:14,160","34:20,780","\"You were making like peanut butter protein smoothies that smelled like crazy peanut butter\""]
["34:20,780","34:26,120","\"I mean, I was doing a lot of shit. I was doing a lot of shit to have this all happen and like then a backfire\""]
["34:26,120","34:28,120","\"Yeah, that it didn't work and so\""]
["34:28,120","34:32,880","\"That sucks. That's how I felt the dawn of the final day. I'm gonna fucking explode\""]
["34:32,880","34:34,520","\"Yeah, so\""]
["34:34,520","34:40,360","\"Essentially Dave had like a turd that had scratched the inside of his colon that inflamed it\""]
["34:40,360","34:43,140","\"Oh my god, because he had eaten too much peanuts\""]
["34:43,760","34:48,720","\"Because you can't process peanuts like other things are kind of like corn and I don't think Dave realized\""]
["34:48,720","34:51,880","\"That and again, they've been eat a lot of like\""]
["34:51,880","34:58,480","\"Vegetables and stuff so we just stopped on peanuts and meat and before that we went to fucking Fogo de Chao\""]
["34:58,480","35:03,820","\"Which is an expensive steakhouse where we stuffed ourselves with steak so Dave had a pound of meat\""]
["35:03,820","35:07,800","\"Along with a pound of peanuts. That's right. We did go to the thing\""]
["35:07,800","35:09,960","\"Yeah, and then he just hibernated one day. Oh\""]
["35:09,960","35:12,920","\"That was not a good time\""]
["35:12,840","35:15,180","\"For a long time Dave was like keep it on the hush hush\""]
["35:15,180","35:19,280","\"but I haven't been able to ship for two days and it's the equivalence of like\""]
["35:19,280","35:25,840","\"Like play-doh squeezing between a giant fucking rock and I'm like that's disgusting. Oh my god\""]
["35:25,840","35:30,680","\"Essentially it sucks. I had to go with Jeff and Jeff took me in and he took me CBS\""]
["35:30,680","35:36,520","\"Oh, yeah, I want to tell the story just getting this so I was like all right. I've just got to get an anima\""]
["35:36,520","35:40,880","\"It sucks, but this is good. Gotta happen. Yeah, you told me this is like a horrible time\""]
["35:40,980","35:44,540","\"You know, it's funny when you built it up like you needed to take an anima\""]
["35:44,540","35:48,100","\"I thought I was gonna come downstairs with we feces fucking sprayed everywhere\""]
["35:48,100","35:51,860","\"No, it's all that picture that I showed Tom with a guy just spray shit all over the wall and it passed out\""]
["35:51,860","35:56,260","\"Like yeah, I thought you'd go to your bed with an ass some shit leading all the way to the bathroom. No\""]
["35:56,260","36:00,460","\"But so I went to get this thing. It's already embarrassing whoa\""]
["36:00,460","36:03,420","\"I take it up to the counter and the dude. I\""]
["36:03,420","36:07,420","\"Put the box down the anima thing and the guy like looks at him like yeah\""]
["36:07,420","36:11,980","\"Not a great day for me and then like he laughs and I've officially deescalated the situation\""]
["36:11,980","36:15,340","\"By shooting your anima juice at him\""]
["36:15,340","36:24,620","\"He looks at me and he says how much I'm in a super Mario. I was like\""]
["36:24,620","36:30,420","\"Two figures of you and yanked up. No, okay\""]
["36:30,420","36:36,700","\"He said about the best super Mario. I was like I looked at myself to see if I was wearing any Mario clothes\""]
["36:36,700","36:43,040","\"And I was like what and he was like he's like yeah, you know where I can get you know some like\""]
["36:43,040","36:50,720","\"Shrooms what and then I pieced it together. Super Mario's like a drug term for like true. Is it really what I mean like like shroom\""]
["36:50,720","36:52,720","\"Super Mario mushrooms\""]
["36:52,720","36:58,360","\"I was like no, I don't and then he looked down. He was really awkward about it. It's like you\""]
["37:00,760","37:05,680","\"Fair I made buying a damn anima not awkward it you would ask me for fucking drugs\""]
["37:05,680","37:10,120","\"Everyone asked Dave because you always look like the kind of guy\""]
["37:10,120","37:16,960","\"Stocking up my skinny white guy a long hair. I look like I do drugs, but I don't I only smoke cigarettes and which is a drug\""]
["37:16,960","37:25,000","\"You can't look like Jesus to me specifically\""]
["37:25,000","37:29,400","\"Moses mixed together\""]

["37:46,840","37:51,560","\"That's kind of dangerous no no, but look oh\""]
["37:51,560","37:55,800","\"Did it snapped off the edge and crushed a kid underneath it\""]
["37:55,800","37:59,800","\"I'd just be worried about that like eventually eroding itself and breaking off\""]
["37:59,800","38:10,360","\"off wait hang on this guy's a bro no he isn't oh god I love this man he makes you pay\""]
