["03:53,000","03:56,920","\"And then the piano guy starts playing a piano solo and we're like um\""]
["03:57,520","04:03,840","\"Why is the fucking orchestra sitting there in silence for this piano solo and these are all arrangements\""]
["04:03,840","04:07,820","\"We've heard before like of the fighting theme and shit. That's like 15 years old now\""]

["05:00,280","05:04,040","\"So at the halfway point I think about\""]
["05:04,040","05:08,080","\"Let's say one quarter to a half of the show has been mid-eye files\""]
["05:08,080","05:13,320","\"And I'm just like they're wasting an orchestra sitting there in the dark playing these mid-eye files\""]
["05:13,320","05:17,520","\"And then I went to the manager at the half-time point. You did it\""]
["05:17,520","05:23,480","\"Yeah, like I went and I was like I want to refund. They're just like what's wrong like\""]

["05:51,880","05:55,940","\"There's a mid-eye from the game. What did like did Twitter have something to say about this?\""]
["05:55,940","05:58,980","\"Yeah, no, Twitter is freaking out the whole up here. No, here's the thing right\""]
["05:58,980","06:02,740","\"I was just like I went on Twitter and I was expecting like people to be like what the fuck and literally\""]
["06:02,740","06:06,140","\"No one was like what the fuck so I was like I was like what the fuck?\""]
["06:06,140","06:08,780","\"Why is this fucking on midnight and then people were like?\""]
["06:08,780","06:16,580","\"Then people started complaining and then rocker response was like oh, yeah, I thought that was kind of weird too and I was like\""]
["06:18,780","06:20,780","\"And I was like, \"\"God damn it!\"\"\""]
["06:20,780","06:24,180","\"And then I was just like, I was just so fucking sad and disappointed.\""]
["06:24,180","06:29,180","\"I was waiting for that concert for fucking months, like hyping it up in my head, just imagining all the cool things.\""]
["06:29,180","06:30,680","\"And here's the fucking zinger.\""]
["06:30,680","06:33,280","\"Fucking Nobuo Matsu composed-\""]
["06:33,280","06:37,580","\"Dude, he arranged songs for orchestra himself for an album he did.\""]
["06:37,580","06:41,480","\"That were all new arrangements, like right before this concert got organized.\""]
["06:41,480","06:43,580","\"He had all these new arrangements for-\""]
["06:43,580","06:47,580","\"-So why do they do that? -Why do they play any of the songs from the new FF7 games?\""]
["06:47,580","06:49,580","\"I've seen that in a two. That two! That two!\""]
["06:49,580","06:49,580","\"That two!\""]
["06:49,580","06:56,480","\"All these fucking new things they could have done and they just went and they played shit from Distant World 1 and like\""]
["06:56,480","07:02,460","\"One new song from Distant World 3 and it's like this is all shit. I've heard a million times before I was so fucking sick\""]
["07:02,460","07:04,560","\"I'm sorry. I mean this isn't the same situation\""]
["07:04,560","07:08,780","\"But I kind of feel the same way with what happened to me when I purchased\""]
["07:08,780","07:16,140","\"I purchased Dragon Quest 11 for PS4. Yeah, yeah, you told me. That makes me so fucking mad. Yeah, I played that game\""]
["07:16,140","07:24,260","\"I got it for PS4. I was really excited and when I found out that we were gonna get the inferior midi version because the dude's just fucking racist to America\""]
["07:24,260","07:29,220","\"He just hates Americans. Yeah, it's like a running joke there, but it's not a very funny fucking joke\""]
["07:29,220","07:34,500","\"But like basically I played all of Dragon Quest. I didn't beat it sadly\""]
["07:34,500","07:38,980","\"I literally got to the last boss of act. Okay, so I beat the game and I did the new game\""]
["07:38,980","07:41,460","\"Like the after game to like the last last boss\""]
["07:41,460","07:46,380","\"Yeah, but I was so upset that I didn't play it and now I see everyone like drag was 11. It's great\""]
["07:46,380","07:51,580","\"I love it on the switch the music so good and it kind of just like it kind of feels like I have a pit\""]
["07:51,580","07:54,660","\"That's like I can't tell that's my heart with a fucking game\""]
["07:54,660","08:00,260","\"Yeah, and so no matter what I will not buy that game for switch and if you like it\""]
["08:00,260","08:07,220","\"No, it's fine. If you like it. I'm glad no, I bought it on PS4. Do not buy it on PS4. Okay, boy\""]
["08:07,580","08:10,740","\"The rest of the games on PS4 get it for the switch\""]
["08:10,740","08:17,940","\"Like fully basically the guy who does the music he's just knows his amazing orchestras\""]
["08:17,940","08:22,760","\"He's great, but he he makes damn well sure that there's only mid-life files for Americans\""]
["08:22,760","08:25,240","\"Yeah, I like Americans only reason\""]
["08:25,240","08:33,760","\"He owns the rights of the song so he sells them independently in the game to the American companies who can't\""]
["08:34,100","08:39,440","\"Yeah, so hopefully you know he croaks and then some other person gets like a fucking hold of the copyright\""]
["08:39,440","08:46,060","\"But basically like the reason why Dragon Quest 8 had an orchestral con like an orchestral concert\""]
["08:46,060","08:48,060","\"I can't say this orchestral concert\""]
["08:48,060","08:50,600","\"Concert piece\""]
["08:50,600","08:56,020","\"Was by accident. Yeah, we did Japan got the MIDI for that one because we got the expanded dq8\""]
["08:56,020","08:59,100","\"We got to like this the orchestra. That's so fucking weird\""]
["08:59,100","09:03,860","\"And they even have the MIDI version for the one they put on three yes, even though it sounds good and it was fun\""]
["09:03,860","09:08,520","\"It's still inferior to the original orchstural. Yeah, here's here's my sob story\""]
["09:08,520","09:12,420","\"Yeah back like nobody was caring about dragon quest for years\""]
["09:12,420","09:17,200","\"So I petitioned to get seven on 3ds and I waited four years for it to come in after the Japanese version\""]
["09:17,200","09:22,600","\"And then it finally came out after I listened to like the orchestral soundtrack for fucking\""]
["09:22,600","09:27,320","\"Years yeah for like a long ass time like just signing these petitions and waiting\""]
["09:27,320","09:32,320","\"We got the game and it was it was the mitties and it kind of ruined the game for me\""]
["09:32,320","09:37,560","\"I played 40 hours of it may be too sad. I didn't finish back in the 70 120 hours and eight\""]
["09:37,560","09:41,760","\"And I stopped playing it. Oh, yeah, by the way, Nate also has the MIDI\""]
["09:41,760","09:47,080","\"I can imagine her frustrating that is because when Final Fantasy 7 came out back in 97\""]
["09:47,080","09:52,960","\"Yeah, it was a PC port and I and I really wanted the PC port for just just to say I have the PC port\""]
["09:52,960","09:58,740","\"Yeah, I played it it had mid-eye files on it because it couldn't fit like wave files on it at the time\""]
["09:58,740","10:00,740","\"Yeah, this is back in 98\""]
["10:01,600","10:07,600","\"But um that like it must be so frustrating just knowing the only fucking reason is because the guy's racist\""]
["10:07,600","10:10,060","\"Yeah, no it is and then they joke about it\""]
["10:10,060","10:13,300","\"But you can see tons of people talk about it online. He just doesn't care\""]
["10:13,300","10:20,200","\"You know why you know why it's because the game doesn't do good. Why the fucking game doesn't do good\""]
["10:20,200","10:24,800","\"It's because you release every other spin-off game. You don't release the main series\""]
["10:24,800","10:26,800","\"That's why nobody fucking plays it\""]
["10:26,800","10:27,800","\"You twine?\""]
["10:27,800","10:30,800","\"Dickhead, if you release the fucking game, is it America?\""]
["10:30,800","10:32,800","\"Then people would fucking play it!\""]
["10:32,800","10:33,800","\"Chris, you love your hip or bade?\""]
["10:33,800","10:34,800","\"Both.\""]
["10:34,800","10:35,800","\"It's great.\""]
["10:35,800","10:39,800","\"It really pissed me off because Dave got me in a Dragon Quest.\""]
["10:39,800","10:41,800","\"I played it, I enjoyed the fuck out of it.\""]
["10:41,800","10:45,800","\"I just want to say, they made damn well sure that when they released 8 on the 3DS,\""]
["10:45,800","10:47,800","\"all the orchestral music was gone.\""]
["10:47,800","10:48,800","\"Yeah, and bitify.\""]
["10:48,800","10:51,800","\"But the orchestral 3DS version in Japan as a orchestra.\""]
["10:51,800","10:53,800","\"Don't just don't say, oh my god.\""]
["10:53,800","10:58,780","\"I just want to jump in it. I literally just want to slam my head in a car door. But guys here\""]
["10:58,780","11:03,780","\"Right before this concert came out. Naboo Matsu\""]
["11:03,780","11:09,160","\"He's a fucking you cousin. Yeah. No, he's awesome. Dude. He's easily\""]
["11:09,160","11:14,440","\"I think he's the only person that when they die like that's a celebrity. I look up to you\""]
["11:14,440","11:22,080","\"I will actually cry like he's fair is everything I love about music, but anyway fucking he did this album called bra bra bra brass\""]
["11:22,240","11:24,240","\"Final Fantasy 7 and it had all these amazing\""]
["11:24,240","11:29,480","\"Arrangements that they could have used for that concert. Yeah, okay\""]
["11:29,480","11:36,040","\"Is he part of like mages? Yeah at the band. I think he's the keyboard guy. He plays piano\""]
["11:36,040","11:43,440","\"But dude, have you ever seen the clip of them playing one-wing an angel? No, I've never seen\""]
["11:43,440","11:49,800","\"It's really funny cuz no boo matsu is really cool and really like like well at the time of recording this\""]
["11:49,800","11:54,200","\"He was having the fucking time of his life on keyboards. He was like doing all this like crazy like that\""]
["11:54,200","11:58,660","\"He's like really expressive with his body language and dancing all over and all that's the bandmates are just standing there\""]
["11:58,660","12:03,080","\"Stiff as a board like they're really good, but they literally just stand with like a stick up their ass and they're like\""]
["12:03,080","12:08,660","\"He's like dancing all over the stage and playing keyboards like a fucking psycho\""]
["12:08,660","12:15,520","\"I'll just be I'll be really sad just because I know how much he shaped my love for music and exactly what I like in music is\""]
["12:15,520","12:19,280","\"Pretty much due to him. So like that that will be like a killer\""]
["12:19,280","12:22,440","\"Yeah, but hopefully he lives for another hundred years\""]
["12:22,440","12:26,580","\"Yeah, you know, they're gonna discover aging and he'll be the first one to get the serum like\""]
["12:26,580","12:34,600","\"I want the clock I need to go back. You want to conny see you die over no\""]
["12:34,600","12:37,800","\"Yeah, I want the clock. Thanks going\""]
["12:37,800","12:43,360","\"He recently stopped touring due to health issues, so that's bad. That's sad man. That sucks\""]
["12:43,360","12:45,680","\"That's not a good sign\""]
["12:45,680","12:51,720","\"It sucks, but well again, maybe they discover aging or maybe they put his body into a robot and he becomes the first Android\""]
["12:51,720","12:54,640","\"There was one magfest where he was literally just hanging out with people\""]
["12:54,640","13:01,020","\"It's been like ah, I was like, it's not boo that's that's fucking awesome. He is like a fucking genius. Yeah\""]

["13:11,240","13:17,640","\"I don't know if I ever talked about it, but I feel like Naboo Matsu's super-duper inspired by the never ending story soundtrack\""]
["13:17,640","13:20,160","\"What I'm not sure if I if I've seen it somewhere\""]
["13:20,160","13:22,560","\"But I was listening to the never ending story soundtrack\""]
["13:22,560","13:26,600","\"And I'm like that sounds really like this song and then it happened like three times in a row\""]
