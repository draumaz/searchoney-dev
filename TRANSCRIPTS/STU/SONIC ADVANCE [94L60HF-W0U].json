["00:00,000","00:29,000","\"Sega, but I mean, lean, lean, well, you know what time it is. The only games I could play with while talking. It's Corey, I had this game. Oh, yeah, baby. It looks great on this huge TV. Hold on, there's probably I can't go up for some reason. Ahhh! Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm ready to go Super Sonic Speed.\""]
["00:29,000","00:33,720","\"This is Sonic Advance 1, I thought Sonic Advance 2 started in Green Grove or whatever the fuck.\""]
["00:33,720","00:37,720","\"Man, this is nostalgic, but you know something?\""]
["00:37,720","00:41,560","\"I remember when I bought this, I was really annoyed at the level design, I wonder...\""]
["00:41,560","00:43,560","\"I wonder why.\""]
["00:43,560","00:44,520","\"I wonder was I right?\""]
["00:44,520","00:47,320","\"Look, when you're running, he's to the right of the screen.\""]
["00:47,320","00:49,400","\"Yeah, why?\""]
["00:49,400","00:50,440","\"This placement is weird.\""]
["00:50,440","00:51,560","\"I don't know, it's strange.\""]
["00:51,560","00:53,560","\"It should be leaving room to see what's ahead of you.\""]
["00:53,560","00:56,040","\"See that, Sonic, oh, I fucked it up.\""]
["00:56,040","00:58,280","\"When you run at the edge of the base of a thing,\""]
["00:58,280","01:00,280","\"Oh\""]
["01:00,280","01:02,200","\"Oh, dude\""]
["01:02,200","01:08,200","\"You didn't so fun. You didn't get the frickin checkpoint. You're right. You're so right frickin frick\""]
["01:08,200","01:18,100","\"Can you like drop - in this game, I don't know you tell me you have to I don't know they invented that by now\""]
["01:18,100","01:23,740","\"Oh, yeah, oh no drop - was mania. What fucking my saying wait? What are you talking about drop - see that shit\""]
["01:23,740","01:29,580","\"Dude when you jump at the bed okay again when you jump at the base while you're going just before you hit the edge and you jump\""]
["01:29,580","01:34,140","\"You gain more speed. That's a that's a sonic fan tip tip trick\""]
["01:34,140","01:40,420","\"There we go done Corey that kick that's dude. Yeah, it was fun. You are the fastest thing alive\""]
["01:40,420","01:42,540","\"It's true best playing his tails\""]
["01:42,540","01:47,900","\"I'd be the slightly second fastest thing and I've probably died his tails faster than Knuckles and Canon I\""]
["01:47,900","01:50,020","\"think so\""]
["01:50,020","01:52,900","\"because well, you know spoilers, but\""]
["01:52,900","01:57,900","\"In the movie, Knuckles wasn't as fast.\""]
["01:57,900","02:00,340","\"Oh yeah, just hit everything, idiot.\""]
["02:00,340","02:02,060","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:02,060","02:03,380","\"- But how come in Sonic Heroes\""]
["02:03,380","02:04,860","\"they can all run at the exact same speed?\""]
["02:04,860","02:05,700","\"Tell me that, huh?\""]
["02:05,700","02:07,100","\"- Because like if Sonic,\""]
["02:07,100","02:09,260","\"if it tails and Knuckles are falling behind,\""]
["02:09,260","02:10,220","\"it would be really boring.\""]
["02:10,220","02:11,060","\"- That'd be fun.\""]
["02:11,060","02:11,900","\"- That'd be fun.\""]
["02:11,900","02:13,020","\"- You would switch to Knuckles and Tails\""]
["02:13,020","02:14,860","\"and they'd be like falling into the water\""]
["02:14,860","02:17,180","\"and fucking like glitching out of bounds.\""]
["02:17,180","02:19,180","\"- You'd be out of breath and like their eyes would be pink.\""]
["02:19,180","02:21,020","\"- You know something that's kind of interesting\""]
["02:21,020","02:26,400","\"Knuckles as originally his name was tuckles and that wasn't supposed to be a tale. It was like Buffalo Bill\""]
["02:26,400","02:36,300","\"Oh\""]
["02:36,300","02:38,300","\"You're actually bad at this\""]
["02:38,300","02:45,260","\"He was on the verge of it and then that crab happened to you yeah\""]
["02:46,860","02:50,300","\"Skipped it get that damn it. You want me get that yeah\""]
["02:50,300","02:53,460","\"Happening\""]
["02:53,460","02:55,460","\"Your crab battle that was so good\""]
["02:55,460","03:01,760","\"You're my crab people. Yeah crab people looks like crab talks like people\""]
["03:01,760","03:09,300","\"Yeah, you know how you play sonic you jump every two seconds and you don't die Wow. It's kind of the trick. That's dr. Egg\""]
["03:09,300","03:12,020","\"That is a bracket. He's eggier than ever\""]
["03:12,020","03:14,740","\"He's gonna yoke you\""]
["03:16,380","03:18,380","\"We\""]
["03:18,380","03:26,740","\"The music's cool for him, but the Game Boy Advance had such a bad sound card. Oh, you're gonna die\""]
["03:26,740","03:33,480","\"Or get the ring I got one ring that I love Sonic for like you always have that one ring that sticks with you in a fight\""]
["03:33,480","03:36,380","\"classic\""]
["03:36,380","03:43,260","\"It's coming back it's coming back for more dude, he literally made this machine just to smash your lead with a hammer\""]
["03:43,860","03:48,220","\"He did something crazy. It's true, but in reality if I was on a bridge\""]
["03:48,220","03:52,060","\"I would just casually walk to the side and it's more on when I have nothing to do his face\""]
["03:52,060","03:57,260","\"Two should be he gets out of that and he just has a regular hammer and he hits you in the head and you start having a seizure\""]
["03:57,260","04:01,460","\"Gorillas I kind of\""]
["04:01,460","04:07,660","\"I love the Sonic event series. I think Sonic events - is better than one, but you know you can't win them all\""]
["04:07,660","04:13,560","\"Why didn't we play the hat? I thought this was Sonic events - we gotta go through them sequence spicy\""]
["04:13,560","04:16,740","\"I think Sonic Advance 1 is awesome music, so it's the one way.\""]
["04:16,740","04:18,640","\"Sonic Advance 3 had the coolest music I've thought.\""]
["04:18,640","04:23,020","\"It also had the whole Sonic Heroes team-up thing before that was even something.\""]
["04:23,020","04:23,620","\"Wow, really?\""]
["04:23,620","04:25,480","\"It had a really cool dynamic system, yeah.\""]
["04:25,480","04:28,580","\"I remember playing Sonic Advance 3 on road trips, and it was so cool.\""]
["04:28,580","04:30,580","\"Remember Sonic on the end-gauge?\""]
["04:30,580","04:31,080","\"Fucking...\""]
["04:31,080","04:33,540","\"It was Sonic Advance 1, but it was somehow worse.\""]
["04:33,540","04:34,900","\"I actually don't. I don't think I've ever played it.\""]
["04:34,900","04:37,220","\"Well, the end-gauge is screen was fucking horizontal.\""]
["04:37,220","04:39,220","\"Yeah, it was really bad.\""]
["04:39,220","04:40,580","\"Yeah, that's something with the Sonic game.\""]
["04:40,580","04:42,900","\"You can't play it as if you're playing on a CRTV.\""]
["04:42,900","04:47,520","\"It has to be widescreen. That's the only way to enjoy a sonic game. You go higher every time you do that. That's crazy\""]
["04:47,520","04:49,520","\"Yeah, man. Well me and home\""]
["04:49,520","04:52,360","\"They really cared about momentum back in the day\""]
["04:52,360","04:58,140","\"But you're going higher. Look at this shit. Don't make no damn sense. It's just Sonic's constantly speeding\""]
["04:58,140","05:02,420","\"He's speeding\""]
["05:02,420","05:05,940","\"This is fun. I like the level design on these stages\""]
["05:05,940","05:09,680","\"They don't feel like punishing like half of the fucking new shit\""]
["05:10,220","05:15,280","\"Like I like I kind of like mania, but I mean I did like me kind of like mania. It's\""]
["05:15,280","05:22,280","\"insulting I liked mania, but I did feel like the the levels went on pretty damn long\""]
["05:22,280","05:27,320","\"Like I remember flying battery you get like seven or eight minutes by the end and you're almost like running cuz\""]
["05:27,320","05:32,540","\"When you hit the nine-minute mark, it's like, you know, it's like that. It's like you're gonna know the sharks come after you\""]
["05:32,540","05:33,580","\"Yeah\""]
["05:33,580","05:39,620","\"But in flying battery it was like um that was really fucking long and that's just like casually playing a Sonic game\""]
["05:39,620","05:46,620","\"game. What's a nice callback? Dude, this fucking music rips. I know it's awesome.\""]
["05:46,620","05:53,180","\"Did Michael Jackson do this one too or no? No, I think they had to remove Michael Jackson\""]
["05:53,180","05:58,980","\"from Sonic 3. I don't I don't think they removed him like they removed him from the\""]
["05:58,980","06:03,660","\"credits. They exalted him of all credit. Yeah poor ma'am J. He just wanted to love\""]
["06:03,660","06:08,260","\"Sonic like everyone else. He was the biggest Sonic fan and that's probably what his downfall\""]
["06:08,260","06:10,500","\"He was an advanced sonic fan\""]
["06:10,500","06:19,140","\"The more advanced you get the more you look like him yeah, the more your skin whitens\""]
["06:19,140","06:23,640","\"Yeah, so you gotta like you got to play sonic and moderation. That's why it's called sonic advance\""]
["06:23,640","06:30,660","\"Or you're absolutely blashed in through this level and I'm loving it. I feel like I should be going a lot faster\""]
["06:30,660","06:34,980","\"I'm I feel like a failure honestly. I honestly can't tell if you're going forwards or backwards right now\""]
["06:34,980","06:39,020","\"I hate those springs that shoot you backwards. Yeah, they put a lot of those in this\""]
["06:39,020","06:43,800","\"It's like oh you got me for a split second, but I'm just coming back. It's like the same old trap. Thank you\""]
["06:43,800","06:45,500","\"Yeah, oh\""]
["06:45,500","06:50,220","\"Yeah, you can do the thing where you like when you land you do like a roll. That's so cool like when you're at a stop\""]
["06:50,220","06:54,220","\"You just go what it's not working. I guess it's not as simple as it sounds\""]
["06:54,220","07:00,700","\"It's not like looks pissed when he hangs off that so does he have like the homing attack in this or what was that?\""]
["07:00,700","07:02,700","\"What's that thing you keep doing with a\""]
["07:03,060","07:09,280","\"That's your a flashy move that you got in like Sonic 3 you she you like hits enemies farther than you hmm\""]
["07:09,280","07:13,380","\"But it was never like utilized or brought into any other game\""]
["07:13,380","07:19,820","\"I like the shields you got\""]
["07:19,820","07:22,220","\"Yeah, I hate that they got rid of all the shields\""]
["07:22,220","07:27,620","\"Jesus a long fucking stage. I feel like it's like I know it's been like only two minutes\""]
["07:27,620","07:30,180","\"But it still feels like he's taking forever. Holy shit Jesus\""]
["07:30,900","07:32,900","\"Are we to boss fight yeah?\""]
["07:32,900","07:36,580","\"You wait\""]
["07:36,580","07:41,460","\"Explanation for this one is I gotta be honest like I feel like the hammer was a better like thing\""]
["07:41,460","07:47,220","\"I feel like this one is makes him objectively worse because he flies normal. He's like land on oh\""]
["07:47,220","07:50,420","\"Count oh the wave of the ground I\""]
["07:50,420","07:55,740","\"Think he's cheating all right. He acts okay. He's actually a fell. He was actually a lot jump\""]
["07:56,980","08:00,900","\"Fuck me, dude. No, I'll still beat him, but he is dastardly\""]
["08:00,900","08:05,820","\"You're a ring no, it's over boys. It's it. Oh\""]
["08:05,820","08:09,660","\"Fuck that was so fucking scary. Oh\""]
["08:09,660","08:15,360","\"Cory that was amazing. That was scary. I was little wait. I had a ring already. Okay, never mind\""]
["08:15,360","08:18,500","\"I was playing on no ring gas three more of a\""]
["08:18,500","08:25,620","\"Need to run for it always it's like there's only purple gorilla gorillas. I've never heard of a purple gorilla\""]
["08:25,620","08:27,620","\"I love this song.\""]
["08:27,620","08:31,720","\"Oh look at that, Sonic Heroes. That's how you do a ping pong thing.\""]
["08:31,720","08:34,620","\"-Pig pong thing. -Were you guys having issues?\""]
["08:34,620","08:36,620","\"-Oh my god. -Ducino stage.\""]
["08:36,620","08:37,620","\"-Ducino stage. -Ducino stage.\""]
["08:37,620","08:39,620","\"-Here's the thing. Sonic Heroes is fun,\""]
["08:39,620","08:44,620","\"but the problem with the casino stage is the gravity movement on the paddles and stuff.\""]
["08:44,620","08:47,620","\"Basically, you control better when you don't touch anything,\""]
["08:47,620","08:51,620","\"but then you can't control where Sonic goes, so you just set the whim of the game, and that's not fun.\""]
["08:51,620","08:54,620","\"-I always want the game to bend to my will.\""]
["08:54,620","08:57,580","\"My will yeah, that's why I'm the game master. I\""]
["08:57,580","09:04,700","\"Think I think the casino stage and the fucking mansion stage are like the mansion stage is just boring because it's like the\""]
["09:04,700","09:09,700","\"Antithesis of a Sonic game and it's not a game you want multiple paths, you know like multiple places to go\""]
["09:09,700","09:16,360","\"Expansive the fucking mansion level is just like hallways and corridors like you're playing fucking sonic forces\""]
["09:16,360","09:18,860","\"go this way\""]
["09:18,860","09:23,100","\"Am I losing time with the hell is a music's going fucking freaking out\""]
["09:24,140","09:29,980","\"Well, what is happening? Oh, I got the speeches. I keep like fucking sideways spray. So doesn't even matter\""]
["09:29,980","09:32,380","\"Yeah, I don't know why they do that. I\""]
["09:32,380","09:37,840","\"Guess they need to think this Chris. It's padding, you know in like any s they made like ultra hard\""]
["09:37,840","09:40,420","\"Well, this they just put fucking springs everywhere. That's how they make sonic\""]
["09:40,420","09:42,500","\"likes harder\""]
["09:42,500","09:44,500","\"But it's not really hard. It's like\""]
["09:44,500","09:47,380","\"It's just to annoy child's yeah, there's annoying kids\""]
["09:47,900","09:53,800","\"But I feel like that that's just gonna work the opposite. I love to annoy a child make child stronger\""]
["09:53,800","10:01,020","\"When child's is annoyed they become more powerful go down. They just learn more. It's true. Oh\""]
["10:01,020","10:05,440","\"Oh, why would you put something in my way going out?\""]
["10:05,440","10:14,620","\"Talking about this game is shitty level design. Yeah, I get I like Sonic Advance 2, but it's still good to get this one out of the way\""]
["10:15,340","10:19,420","\"Take it off the bucket list Chris's bucket list is to play every Sonic game and then go\""]
["10:19,420","10:21,780","\"Skydiving won't play in the last one\""]
["10:21,780","10:26,720","\"I'm not doing when you beat the Sonic game. Well your parachute opens\""]
["10:26,720","10:34,080","\"Skydiving hell no, yeah, you have to play set on Sonic Labyrinth. That's the last game you play if you can't beat\""]
["10:34,080","10:36,500","\"supersonic racing\""]
["10:36,500","10:39,980","\"Super sonic are yeah\""]
["10:41,620","10:45,760","\"Sonic are it's like a five minute game we could get that shit done in 30 minutes. That game's dog shit\""]
["10:45,760","10:51,120","\"I owned it. I the best thing of that is the music genuinely. We've been listening to it all week\""]
["10:51,120","10:56,760","\"It's awesome fucking lyrics that are so fucking psychotic. They are crazy, but they're so like catchy\""]
["10:56,760","10:59,940","\"Hit the balloon go the opposite direction\""]

["11:22,380","11:30,300","\"He'd be like I like all of duty. No thanks dad. I want to read a book. You're no son of mine. That's boring\""]
["11:30,300","11:35,260","\"You should run a lot you need a cosplay zay me so I can kiss you\""]
["11:35,260","11:40,660","\"That's what happens in Sonic.\""]
