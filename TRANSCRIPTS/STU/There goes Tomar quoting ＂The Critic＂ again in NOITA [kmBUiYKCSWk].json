["13:00,820","13:07,880","\"It's because of the ending. I thought it was just an allegory for smoking weed or was that just some bullshit people said to be funny\""]
["13:08,740","13:14,540","\"Yeah, I don't I think that's just something that people decided because it was the 60s or 70s or whatever and they're like\""]
["13:14,540","13:16,980","\"Yeah, it must have been drugs because everything was drugs\""]
["13:16,980","13:21,620","\"But yeah, supposedly that the author of the song said it was never meant to be about drugs\""]
["13:21,620","13:25,460","\"It was just supposed to be a whimsical tale about a dragon\""]
["13:25,460","13:30,900","\"You know, I don't know why but for some reason I just assume puff the magic dragon was like written in like\""]
["13:30,900","13:37,580","\"1902 and then the the author the song would have been long dead by by that point when was it written?\""]
["13:37,580","13:43,640","\"I don't know. You're probably not that long ago. For some reason I just put everything before I was born.\""]
["13:43,640","13:47,440","\"It was Peter, Paul, and Mary. So it definitely was in 1902.\""]
["13:47,440","13:48,580","\"But...\""]
["13:48,580","13:57,920","\"There's some weird ones where it's just like, you find out they were written in like 1998, and you're like, \"\"Oh, I thought that song like always existed.\"\"\""]
["13:57,920","14:00,400","\"It was recorded in 1962.\""]
["14:00,400","14:04,560","\"1962, huh? Not bad, kid.\""]
["14:04,560","14:09,740","\"Yeah, so that would have been that would have been when you wrote a song about drugs called Puff the Magic Dragon\""]
["14:09,740","14:14,840","\"There's that famous scene for meet the parents where that's what the Ben Stiller says\""]
["14:14,840","14:22,520","\"Robert De Niro characters listening to Puff the Magic Dragon and it's his favorite song and then Ben De Niro Ben Stiller is like\""]
["14:22,520","14:29,080","\"Oh, it's like they say it's about drugs. Huh? Yeah, they've always denied that it was about drugs\""]
["14:30,560","14:35,520","\"Lipton and Yarrow who wrote the song I really like the movie meet the parents\""]
["14:35,520","14:41,440","\"Do you yeah, actually I love that movie. I couldn't tell if that was like no I swear. Why would I lie?\""]
["14:41,440","14:47,240","\"I don't know. Why do you do half the shit you do? I just sometimes assume that when you're like yeah, it's a good movie\""]
["14:47,240","14:51,860","\"I feel you just because Seth McFarland hates it. Does he yeah?\""]
["14:51,860","14:55,300","\"He made a fucking do you remember Seth McFarland's Calvaclate of cartoon comedy?\""]

["15:09,640","15:10,800","\"- You're probably right.\""]
["15:10,800","15:12,560","\"I think Seth McFarland has a lot of talent,\""]
["15:12,560","15:14,560","\"but he wastes it a lot of the time.\""]
["15:14,560","15:17,640","\"- I don't think he throws out ideas anymore as the problem.\""]
["15:17,640","15:18,480","\"- Yeah.\""]
