["04:13,820","04:20,860","\"I think I think it's supposed to be like the transformers thing remember in transformers when like the fucking I think the toaster\""]
["04:20,860","04:23,500","\"Also turned evil in that yeah, but why\""]
["04:23,500","04:29,780","\"If the toaster was evil it wouldn't suddenly spout teeth and like start smacking you with a cord\""]

["04:33,020","04:36,620","\"I was not expecting to have to pay attention in G4.\""]
["04:36,620","04:40,220","\"For someone who's not paying attention, you sure are like playing the game.\""]
["04:40,220","04:42,220","\"Like you're kind of going through it.\""]
["04:42,220","04:45,820","\"What if this whole office building is the game and it's only 15 minutes long?\""]
["04:45,820","04:47,820","\"Also, why does he always smile?\""]
["04:47,820","04:49,820","\"That'd be like merciful.\""]
["04:49,820","04:52,620","\"If this was like an hour-long game, it'd be perfect.\""]
["04:52,620","04:55,020","\"I wonder if it's based off actual drills.\""]
["04:55,020","04:56,820","\"Yeah, that thing is disgusting.\""]
["04:56,820","04:57,820","\"Their noses really do that.\""]
["04:57,820","04:59,820","\"I want that to die so bad.\""]
["04:59,820","05:02,020","\"They have like sensors on their nose so they can dig.\""]
["05:02,020","05:03,740","\"That's a story for next time.\""]

["05:06,060","05:06,900","\"They look the same.\""]
["05:06,900","05:08,060","\"Yeah, that's true.\""]
["05:08,060","05:11,140","\"A lot of unique animation for this game.\""]
["05:11,140","05:15,340","\"Because they had to put shit on animals to do it.\""]
["05:15,340","05:16,820","\"The animation is really good, though.\""]
["05:16,820","05:17,980","\"Look at the electronics.\""]
["05:17,980","05:18,980","\"That looks really good.\""]
["05:18,980","05:20,620","\"Like they're lighting on that shit.\""]
["05:20,620","05:22,260","\"Do you think when they were making G-Force,\""]
["05:22,260","05:24,660","\"they took hours upon hours of reference\""]
["05:24,660","05:27,940","\"footage of actual guinea pigs to mocap it perfectly?\""]
["05:27,940","05:29,900","\"It feels like it's weird.\""]
["05:29,900","05:30,580","\"Yes!\""]
["05:30,580","05:31,860","\"I don't know if it feels like this is\""]
["05:31,860","05:33,780","\"Just how they move.\""]
["05:33,780","05:34,780","\"- It's really strange.\""]
["05:34,780","05:36,620","\"Like, you know when people make these games,\""]
["05:36,620","05:38,460","\"like let's say you're making like Ratatouille\""]
["05:38,460","05:40,260","\"for PlayStation 3.\""]
["05:40,260","05:41,100","\"- Cool.\""]
["05:41,100","05:41,940","\"- You could just be like,\""]
["05:41,940","05:43,820","\"okay, we're gonna make a really boring game\""]
["05:43,820","05:46,500","\"where it's like a bad cooking mama simulator\""]
["05:46,500","05:50,060","\"or we'll make like this crazy like over the top\""]
["05:50,060","05:52,540","\"adventure platformer, like how do you even get\""]
["05:52,540","05:53,380","\"to that point?\""]
["05:53,380","05:54,780","\"- Are you saying that Ratatouille\""]
["05:54,780","05:56,900","\"for the PlayStation 3 is a hidden gem?\""]
["05:56,900","05:57,740","\"- I don't know.\""]
["05:57,740","05:59,220","\"I was just giving an example of something\""]
["05:59,220","06:00,540","\"that probably has-- - Ratatouille.\""]
["06:00,540","06:04,140","\"I think Rhett2 probably sucks, but you never know G4 is surprised.\""]
["06:04,140","06:09,100","\"But it's like, you know, there's like, they don't really make these kinds of games anymore.\""]
["06:09,100","06:13,100","\"Remember like THQs to make these games all the time and they were like kind of endearing\""]
["06:13,100","06:15,020","\"with like a new Disney movie games out?\""]
["06:15,020","06:16,500","\"You know there'd be a game with it?\""]
["06:16,500","06:18,860","\"Like in Ch- and Kanto would probably have a fucking game.\""]
["06:18,860","06:19,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:19,860","06:24,020","\"And like turning red would probably have a game where you turn into the fucking red.\""]
["06:24,020","06:28,780","\"I could see a turning red game not being good, but like mechanically being pretty like-\""]
["06:28,780","06:34,500","\"Really annoying yeah, you kind of know what to do like I feel like if they were teach cute is still doing stuff\""]
["06:34,500","06:37,820","\"You probably would have gotten a sonic movie - fucking game or sonic movie game\""]
["06:37,820","06:42,980","\"So right I mean Sonic is a game. That's the point, right?\""]
["06:42,980","06:49,020","\"Yeah, but although they did make a game of that fucking showed and they sucks which one the\""]
["06:49,020","06:56,320","\"The well the game sucks. I don't know if the show's any good the the sonic show what show they all have bandages on their arms\""]
["06:56,320","06:59,400","\"It was called. Oh, it's not a boom. The show is okay\""]
["06:59,400","07:04,640","\"Yeah, the game I've heard is shit the game was awful. Do you know why the game was shit?\""]
["07:04,640","07:08,320","\"Do you know the story? No, because of course I do because I'm a loser\""]
["07:08,320","07:14,140","\"But the reason why the game was shit is because it was being built on a cry engine for other consoles\""]
["07:14,140","07:17,120","\"Oh, and it ran really well on the cry in fact\""]
["07:17,120","07:19,720","\"They had to rebuild the game from like start to finish\""]
["07:19,720","07:25,840","\"Because when they ported it to the Wii U it ran like absolute dog shit because Sega had bought this like\""]
["07:25,840","07:32,480","\"They bought this agreement to release three games on the Wii U and that was one of them\""]
["07:32,480","07:36,140","\"And when they brought it to it, it's like the CryEngine ran like shit on the Wii U\""]
["07:36,140","07:38,740","\"It's like this game isn't gonna run on the Wii U. They're like well make it work\""]
["07:38,740","07:41,680","\"And so they had to make it work and that's why it's a like a piece of shit\""]
["07:41,680","07:47,640","\"But so they rebuilt it from the ground up for all the other consoles as well? No, it was only on the Wii U\""]
["07:47,640","07:50,320","\"They were planning on releasing it on other stuff, but they're like no\""]
["07:50,320","07:54,560","\"It's only going on the Wii U and they're like okay. Well, this is really bad. So when the game came out\""]
["07:54,560","08:01,680","\"I mean the game probably wouldn't be that great because it just looks like a I don't know a Jack and Daxter clown like a really basic game\""]
["08:01,680","08:02,960","\"but uh\""]
["08:02,960","08:08,860","\"It would have been better. It would have not ran like shit. Okay, Corey. So why do all the other Sonic games suck then?\""]
["08:08,860","08:12,320","\"Which ones all the ones that suck?\""]
["08:12,320","08:15,880","\"uh\""]
["08:15,880","08:17,960","\"Sonic\""]
["08:17,960","08:20,160","\"Black Knight\""]
["08:20,160","08:24,320","\"Well that game just sucks because they were making a different game style. I was boring shit\""]
["08:24,320","08:29,200","\"People say that game is good, but like it's Sonic on rails. Well, that's not fun\""]
["08:29,200","08:32,800","\"Jabba the slave\""]
["08:32,800","08:40,320","\"Yeah, so how come how come why come they did that not did a good game? What why did they make a game said good game?\""]
["08:40,320","08:43,840","\"Why why for come?\""]
["08:44,160","08:49,220","\"Why for come shadow the hedgehog not good that could have that should have been the best Sonic game\""]
["08:49,220","08:55,020","\"Because I was gone headshot cuz they makes Sonic Heroes engine and it stinks like shit\""]
["08:55,020","08:57,020","\"And then wasn't very good\""]
["08:57,020","09:04,700","\"Actually shadow the hedgehog sucks because it played well at first and then in order to make the guns viable\""]
["09:04,700","09:08,000","\"They made it control like shit. So you were forced to use the guns\""]
["09:08,000","09:11,340","\"That's true. That was in an interview with\""]
["09:11,940","09:13,940","\"T-T-Kashi Izuka.\""]
["09:13,940","09:16,660","\"So he said, he said, \"\"We made the game shitty so the guns were all over.\"\"\""]
["09:16,660","09:19,860","\"He's like, \"\"Oh, we make game bad so no one enjoy it but guns!\"\"\""]
["09:19,860","09:20,980","\"[laughter]\""]
["09:20,980","09:23,780","\"Did I ever tell you how I got Shadow the Hedgehog?\""]
["09:23,780","09:24,980","\"No.\""]
["09:24,980","09:33,940","\"So I, I like, I went to a game stop when I was, I don't, I don't remember, I was maybe like 13, 14.\""]
["09:33,940","09:34,420","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:34,420","09:41,140","\"And I guess uh, I guess like, I walked in and there was like a mom like trying to return it.\""]
["09:41,140","09:45,900","\"And the kid was like screaming and the kid was like being like a real asshole and be like\""]
["09:45,900","09:47,940","\"\"\"I FUCKING HIT YOU MOM AND DIDN'T LIKE\"\"\""]
["09:47,940","09:50,620","\"Like he was like throwing like a full blown like dance right\""]
["09:50,620","09:54,100","\"The game? The guns are like 8 cannon and shit\""]
["09:54,100","09:55,300","\"Yeah, like baby guns\""]
["09:55,300","09:59,740","\"For some reason she wasn't getting a refund\""]
["09:59,740","10:03,380","\"And this kid was like fucking screaming up and down the wall about it\""]
["10:03,380","10:07,140","\"So she was just like \"\"Fine, you can have this game\"\" and I was like \"\"Oh\"\"\""]
["10:07,140","10:10,780","\"You're like cool, the core is for game\""]
["10:10,780","10:13,680","\"I got that game for free, so maybe like...\""]
["10:13,680","10:17,580","\"I got a little bit of enjoyment out of it, so maybe it was like kind of like...\""]
["10:17,580","10:20,680","\"Just because I got it for like nothing, you know?\""]
["10:20,680","10:23,680","\"So that headshot could have been good if it didn't control like shit.\""]
["10:23,680","10:26,480","\"I don't feel like that would have happened, I feel like it would have been ripped apart.\""]
["10:26,480","10:29,980","\"I honestly feel like their big mistake was giving enemies like health bars.\""]
["10:29,980","10:31,580","\"They should just cap the sonic thing more.\""]
["10:31,580","10:34,380","\"I mean it was fun to use the gun, but uh...\""]
["10:34,380","10:35,680","\"Okay, cool.\""]
["10:35,680","10:36,880","\"I gotta go to bathroom.\""]
["10:36,880","10:38,180","\"You got a poop real bad.\""]
["10:38,180","10:39,180","\"What? I gotta shit real bad.\""]
["10:39,180","10:44,240","\"That was the big thing with with Shadow the Hedgehog is everything took a bunch of hits to kill enemies and Sonic\""]
["10:44,240","10:47,700","\"Usually you're just supposed to like hit them once and then like move past them\""]
["10:47,700","10:52,080","\"You know should we mic up the toilet for future. Oh, new plays so we can\""]
["10:52,080","11:03,020","\"Look into like like how to mic a drum kit so that we can kind of get like all the dynamics of like\""]
["11:03,020","11:07,880","\"Splattering and ripping ass and you know all the cool things we do\""]
["11:07,880","11:09,880","\"I think I you just need to put a bunch of uh\""]
["11:09,880","11:14,760","\"different kinds of mics and different kinds of places I feel like I feel like if uh\""]
["11:14,760","11:20,880","\"Okay, real question if if something like BTS or something have like a poop cam\""]
["11:20,880","11:28,960","\"What the hell is BTS? It's that K-pop thing that everybody likes or you know the people like that like K-pop like I guess yeah\""]
["11:28,960","11:33,880","\"Well, I mean I guess you wouldn't be the expert if you don't even know what the fuck they are\""]
["11:34,280","11:37,280","\"And let's say Justin Bieber for for example, okay\""]
["11:37,280","11:43,340","\"So you're hiding in popularity if a mega celebrity had like a public thing where he's like okay\""]
["11:43,340","11:44,800","\"I would say like my poop camp\""]
["11:44,800","11:50,080","\"I would say maybe like hyper specifically a mega celebrity aimed at like like a twilight\""]
["11:50,080","11:55,640","\"Actor or somebody not now, but like Tom Holland. I guess at this point. Yeah like\""]
["11:55,640","11:58,640","\"Tom Collins poop camp\""]
["11:58,640","12:05,880","\"I think it would be the biggest news for a week and then it would just like wear off and everyone be like he's gross\""]
["12:05,880","12:08,360","\"And that's disgusting and I feel bad for looking at it\""]
["12:08,360","12:14,800","\"I think it would I think it would catch on people would tune in over and over to watch that like I\""]
["12:14,800","12:17,040","\"Would be curious yourself\""]
