["00:05,360","00:09,000","\"I would have done the music for this game had they just have asked.\""]
["00:09,000","00:10,560","\"I would have too.\""]
["00:10,560","00:11,760","\"I think we all would have.\""]
["00:11,760","00:14,760","\"Tomar has been doing it as we go.\""]
["00:14,760","00:15,960","\"This is gonna say...\""]
["00:15,960","00:17,100","\"I'm...\""]
["00:17,100","00:19,840","\"I've been adding a little here and there.\""]
["00:19,840","00:22,280","\"I wonder where this creepy corridor...\""]
["00:22,280","00:23,300","\"Huh!\""]
["00:23,300","00:25,160","\"I'm really good at jumping.\""]
["00:25,160","00:25,760","\"I know.\""]
["00:25,760","00:29,600","\"I've been taught how to jump like in this kind of game by Crash Bandicoot.\""]
["00:29,600","00:32,200","\"And Super Mario.\""]
["00:32,200","00:33,200","\"Wow.\""]
["00:33,200","00:35,400","\"It's a pretty impressive resume.\""]
["00:35,400","00:38,200","\"It's too dark for me to move on.\""]
["00:38,200","00:39,400","\"I can't see a thing.\""]
["00:39,400","00:41,200","\"The dark is too dark to move on.\""]
["00:41,200","00:42,200","\"I'm too scared.\""]
["00:42,200","00:44,200","\"I can't even move on.\""]
["00:44,200","00:45,400","\"Can I grab a torch?\""]
["00:45,400","00:46,200","\"I can't hear.\""]
["00:46,200","00:47,200","\"There's the torch.\""]
["00:47,200","00:48,200","\"Give me a date.\""]
["00:48,200","00:52,400","\"Aw, he did it.\""]
["00:52,400","00:53,600","\"See now we can move on.\""]
["00:53,600","00:55,400","\"I wish he could wipe the dirt off the screen.\""]
["00:55,400","00:56,800","\"Oh, you can't run with a torch.\""]
["00:56,800","00:57,800","\"Oh, you can.\""]
["00:57,800","00:58,800","\"Okay.\""]
["00:58,800","01:01,300","\"[laughter]\""]
["01:01,300","01:04,100","\"That is deserved, I mean.\""]
["01:04,100","01:06,800","\"That's not what an explorer would do.\""]
["01:06,800","01:08,340","\"See, if he didn't have the torch there,\""]
["01:08,340","01:10,300","\"he could have just walked across the darkness\""]
["01:10,300","01:12,000","\"'cause it would have been solid.\""]
["01:12,000","01:15,700","\"It's knowing about the big gaping chasm\""]
["01:15,700","01:17,100","\"that made you fall into it.\""]
["01:17,100","01:18,600","\"[laughter]\""]
["01:18,600","01:21,100","\"I jumped, I really did, I swear.\""]
["01:21,100","01:23,100","\"Yeah, you would know, you do have a spirit.\""]
["01:23,100","01:27,100","\"Well, crash, crash and Mr. Plummer\""]
["01:27,100","01:32,100","\"are frowning right now looking down from heaven.\""]
["01:32,100","01:35,420","\"- Both your Mr. Mihoggies are very upset with you.\""]
["01:35,420","01:39,620","\"I think Sprinting just kinda freaks out the game a bit.\""]
["01:39,620","01:42,300","\"He does look a lot like Drake, doesn't he?\""]
["01:42,300","01:46,380","\"- Yeah, you can almost say they did that on purpose probably.\""]
["01:46,380","01:48,660","\"- So this is like, you explained it really well.\""]
["01:48,660","01:49,500","\"It was like a--\""]
["01:49,500","01:51,060","\"- It's just brand confusion.\""]
["01:51,060","01:53,660","\"- Although I don't know like if that translates--\""]
["01:53,660","01:54,660","\"- Uh-oh. - Can you sidle along\""]
["01:54,660","01:55,700","\"the right wall?\""]
["01:55,700","01:59,300","\"It probably does translate a little bit to like steam and stuff.\""]
["01:59,300","02:02,420","\"Where if like a kid is like, \"\"I want uncharted!\"\"\""]
["02:02,420","02:06,420","\"But the mom is like, \"\"You only have a computer. You don't have a PlayStation.\"\"\""]
["02:06,420","02:09,860","\"She can like look up on charted on steam and this will come up maybe.\""]
["02:09,860","02:17,780","\"So you can have a little bit of like that olden days like Blockbuster like knockoff cars franchise shit.\""]
["02:17,780","02:21,940","\"I mean, I guess you can't because I'm pretty sure that this game uh...\""]
["02:21,940","02:22,780","\"\"\"Are you afraid of the dark?\"\"\""]
["02:22,780","02:24,180","\"This game didn't do too well.\""]
["02:24,180","02:26,180","\"from when we were young.\""]
["02:26,180","02:28,180","\"Why did she just say that?\""]
["02:28,180","02:32,180","\"But I think you're not far off with what their business strategy was.\""]
["02:32,180","02:34,180","\"Oh no, that's definitely what they're going for.\""]
["02:34,180","02:36,180","\"Did you hear what she just said?\""]
["02:36,180","02:37,180","\"What did she say?\""]
["02:37,180","02:38,180","\"She went, \"\"Are you afraid of the dark?\""]
["02:38,180","02:40,180","\"Remember that show from when we were young?\"\"\""]
["02:40,180","02:44,180","\"Yeah, how does she, is she watching?\""]
["02:44,180","02:46,180","\"Does that board go all the way across?\""]
["02:46,180","02:48,180","\"I can't even fucking see.\""]
["02:48,180","02:50,180","\"Yeah, I guarantee you'll be bored all the way across.\""]
["02:50,180","02:56,100","\"way across. If he starts to fall, press the other way.\""]
["02:56,100","03:05,940","\"There friggin goofball. I rock at this. You're maybe why would you do that among the top\""]
["03:05,940","03:10,740","\"20 players of this game in the world? I would probably think that. Yeah. You're among the\""]
["03:10,740","03:18,540","\"only 20 players. Fuck yeah. He's so strong. That's what I do whenever an obstacle is\""]
["03:18,540","03:26,180","\"in my way. Oh my god. Oh. All right. It looks like you're it\""]
["03:26,180","03:32,420","\"looked for a second like you're trying to get it. I am. Oh,\""]
["03:32,420","03:35,940","\"when you fall to the swing at all. They'll never get me this\""]
["03:35,940","03:43,420","\"time. Oh, it almost got me. Oh my god. Oh, I don't like the\""]
["03:43,420","03:46,140","\"sound. That was pretty impressive, Chris. Holy shit. This\""]
["03:46,140","03:48,140","\"This looks fun. This is the best game.\""]
["03:48,140","03:56,180","\"Do you think they've got real physics on them or are these all canned animations? I actually don't know.\""]
["03:56,180","03:58,420","\"It's definitely everything's been canned on this.\""]
["03:58,420","04:02,500","\"Woo!\""]
["04:02,500","04:08,620","\"This is fucking... That looked like it was physics. This is physics! Also, holy shit!\""]
["04:08,620","04:10,620","\"It is! That's where you're older.\""]
["04:10,620","04:12,620","\"I think this is where the mummy is.\""]
["04:12,620","04:14,620","\"Maybe when you're older!\""]
["04:14,620","04:17,620","\"I think it's where the mummy is.\""]
["04:17,620","04:21,620","\"Remember the two unlocking mechanisms I told you about earlier?\""]
["04:21,620","04:22,620","\"That's where they come in.\""]
["04:22,620","04:26,620","\"You need to look for two golden daggers and use them to open this door.\""]
["04:26,620","04:28,620","\"Two golden daggers?\""]
["04:28,620","04:29,620","\"Got it.\""]
["04:29,620","04:31,620","\"That shouldn't be too hard to find in this place.\""]
["04:31,620","04:37,620","\"I bet there's a golden dagger behind each of those doors on your left and right and they help you unlock the one in the middle.\""]
["04:37,620","04:38,620","\"What makes you say that?\""]
["04:38,620","04:42,620","\"Okay, Donia. I see one of the statues holding the dagger on the other side of the room\""]
["04:42,620","04:46,440","\"And I don't think I will be able to climb up again. I don't think I will be able to climb\""]
["04:46,440","04:49,820","\"God some of the stiffest friggin deliveries\""]
["04:49,820","04:52,620","\"Yeah, okay, mr. Voice actor\""]
["04:52,620","04:58,340","\"RC car are you serious RC car dude?\""]
["04:58,340","05:04,300","\"Do you remember that era of games where every fucking game had a car? I will give it a try\""]
["05:06,180","05:10,580","\"What was up with that every game for a while had like a fucking segment like this\""]
["05:10,580","05:15,940","\"Remember the fuck's going on. Why suddenly do you have this there was?\""]
["05:15,940","05:24,240","\"For some reason like marketing data to suggest that this was what people wanted they did I wanted it. I don't know why\""]
["05:24,240","05:27,380","\"I guess you just wanted I just kid dude\""]
["05:27,380","05:31,900","\"Every other game had some mechanic like this didn't they for a little while?\""]
["05:31,900","05:35,220","\"Yeah, like especially like military shooters and stuff like that\""]
["05:35,220","05:37,760","\"I guess you got to leave it on the pad like your your ghost\""]
["05:37,760","05:43,820","\"Recons and your call of duties and you're fucking like all these games would usually that thing would go through a vent\""]
["05:43,820","05:45,820","\"It didn't go through a vent here, but\""]
["05:45,820","05:51,820","\"Yeah, okay, can I you can make that jump can I?\""]
["05:51,820","05:58,940","\"Yeah, get up you little man, but now oh gotta make two big jumps. I don't know\""]
["05:58,940","06:00,780","\"Do you actually have to make that okay?\""]
["06:00,780","06:03,500","\"I guess you stupid asshole\""]
["06:03,500","06:08,140","\"He fucking made that wait and that counted as just a loss\""]
["06:08,140","06:11,140","\"Oh, yeah, because he can't get back up\""]
["06:11,140","06:17,220","\"He said that when he walked into the room. He said if I fall I can't get back up man. That's just lazy coating\""]
["06:17,220","06:23,720","\"That's just lazy. They should have just put spikes here instead of having him fucking explain like oh if I fall\""]
["06:23,720","06:27,740","\"I don't think I can climb back. Yeah, it was more effort not to just do that\""]
["06:27,860","06:34,020","\"This is a good game though now that they there is this in it. Yeah, it's got cool colors red and black classic\""]
["06:34,020","06:41,180","\"So just buy this game's own mechanics you should have been able to make that jump\""]
["06:41,180","06:46,540","\"He just didn't grab it. Yup, cuz that would ruin the puzzle. Yeah, everything about the design of this\""]
["06:46,540","06:49,140","\"Makes me cry\""]
["06:49,140","06:52,020","\"Hey, you got a digger\""]
["06:53,260","07:00,180","\"Make sure you never go on the floor. I won't not once not once not ever. I profusely will not\""]
["07:00,180","07:03,180","\"go\""]
["07:03,180","07:10,140","\"I never thought I'd hear this kind of music while looking at a cool or sea car. Yeah, well now your dream is fulfilled\""]
["07:10,140","07:15,660","\"Your dream of spending more time than you had planned in a\""]
["07:15,660","07:21,960","\"On on a dagger puzzle now watch me miss this jump you ready\""]
["07:21,960","07:26,760","\"Don't miss I jumped and he didn't jump, but at least he fucking did it\""]
["07:26,760","07:32,440","\"So we don't need a stupid car no more right now. It's stuck down there if you can't get up there it can't get back up\""]
["07:32,440","07:37,620","\"Just one more dagger to go. I didn't even say anything that time\""]
["07:37,620","07:41,420","\"He said something for all four of those individual\""]
["07:41,420","07:43,880","\"Yeah, they got tired after that puzzle\""]
["07:43,880","07:46,280","\"He stopped voicing stuff\""]
["07:46,280","07:48,760","\"Use your monkey skills. Whoa\""]
["07:50,080","07:53,920","\"A dagger in the door keeps me off the floor.\""]
["07:53,920","07:58,240","\"A dagger in the heart makes me God a fart.\""]
["07:58,240","07:59,240","\"He wouldn't say that.\""]
["07:59,240","08:03,120","\"That would, uh, that would send I religious.\""]
["08:03,120","08:04,920","\"Farting is very sinful, right?\""]
["08:04,920","08:05,920","\"I think so.\""]
["08:05,920","08:09,040","\"I think God says if you fart once, you go to hell.\""]
["08:09,040","08:10,040","\"If you fart twice.\""]
["08:10,040","08:11,040","\"You fart once.\""]
["08:11,040","08:12,040","\"You're going to smell.\""]
["08:12,040","08:13,040","\"I believe it.\""]
["08:13,040","08:14,040","\"Oh.\""]
["08:14,040","08:15,040","\"Oh.\""]
["08:15,040","08:16,040","\"Oh.\""]
["08:16,040","08:17,040","\"Oh.\""]
["08:17,040","08:21,380","\"I wonder what this poll was used for.\""]
["08:21,380","08:23,380","\"Oh shit.\""]
["08:23,380","08:26,220","\"Oh god.\""]
["08:26,220","08:27,420","\"Tomar, you're an engineer.\""]
["08:27,420","08:28,420","\"How does that work?\""]
["08:28,420","08:29,920","\"Just a little more.\""]
["08:29,920","08:33,220","\"The infinite little spikes shooting out of the wall.\""]
["08:33,220","08:34,220","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:34,220","08:35,220","\"Wow.\""]
["08:35,220","08:36,220","\"The ancient.\""]
["08:36,220","08:37,220","\"I cannot see.\""]
["08:37,220","08:38,220","\"The ancient sun drop.\""]
["08:38,220","08:40,420","\"I can't see where I am with the depth perception.\""]
["08:40,420","08:43,460","\"Yeah, it's kind of like you're playing a bad game, but I don't think it's that.\""]
["08:43,460","08:44,460","\"I don't think it's that.\""]
["08:44,460","08:45,460","\"You might just want to go.\""]
["08:45,460","08:46,460","\"I think you'll survive.\""]
["08:46,460","08:48,860","\"if you get hit by a go go go.\""]
["08:48,860","08:50,780","\"Yeah, apparently you can survive one\""]
["08:50,780","08:51,820","\"and then you're magical.\""]
["08:51,820","08:53,380","\"You shit fucking game.\""]
["08:53,380","08:54,460","\"You could literally just wait\""]
["08:54,460","08:57,580","\"for your little halo shield to come back.\""]
["08:57,580","09:00,540","\"The timing is not as easy as it looks.\""]
["09:00,540","09:01,980","\"Sometimes he doesn't go.\""]
["09:01,980","09:03,460","\"Okay.\""]
["09:03,460","09:05,020","\"After this one shoots, just go.\""]
["09:05,020","09:06,780","\"Even if you get hit by the second one,\""]
["09:06,780","09:07,620","\"you'll be fine.\""]
["09:07,620","09:08,460","\"It doesn't matter.\""]
["09:08,460","09:09,300","\"Very good.\""]
["09:09,300","09:10,740","\"Just keep going.\""]
["09:10,740","09:12,780","\"Don't even worry about that one.\""]
["09:12,780","09:13,860","\"That almost killed me.\""]
["09:13,860","09:17,480","\"But it didn't and we knew it wouldn't bowl the music\""]
["09:17,480","09:26,660","\"Holy shit, I gotta make this crazy jump you can do it. It's a lot harder than it looks this game controls like fucking shit\""]
["09:26,660","09:36,140","\"We ready yeah, but if you miss it I'm going that fucking torch get up stupid. Thank you. Oh\""]
["09:36,140","09:40,060","\"Look a dagger\""]
["09:42,060","09:47,340","\"Alright, do I have to can you just jump down I bet if I fall down I'll die. I just bet it okay\""]
["09:47,340","09:52,340","\"Okay, we're good. Wow you lost a bet today\""]
["09:52,340","10:00,700","\"Are we ever gonna fucking get to the main part of this first dagger in that hole you say that like we're not in the main\""]
["10:00,700","10:02,700","\"part of this game\""]
["10:02,700","10:04,700","\"It seems like\""]
["10:08,700","10:13,400","\"Look at what yeah, I can't see anything. It's dark isn't it just mystical?\""]
["10:13,400","10:16,640","\"I just saw a group of armed men enter the tomb there\""]
["10:16,640","10:18,960","\"What?\""]
["10:18,960","10:21,880","\"Donia see they use contractions there\""]
["10:21,880","10:28,140","\"Because he was urgently saying you should finish quickly they are what?\""]
["10:28,140","10:32,480","\"They are they are they are what they are what?\""]
["10:32,480","10:38,180","\"It's going to be attributed to us really\""]
["10:38,180","10:40,180","\"Technically I did all the work.\""]
["10:40,180","10:42,180","\"It's just that I'd be worth it.\""]
["10:42,180","10:46,180","\"My sister saw people with guns coming to kill both of us, but I must make this quip.\""]
["10:46,180","10:48,180","\"We came in here to get Mott's.\""]
