["25:09,900","25:14,380","\"Because they can't really live good lives\""]
["25:14,380","25:19,000","\"really unless they live out on farms or things but people living in towns and\""]
["25:19,000","25:23,340","\"cities I don't know it just doesn't seem right to me I think it's funny they're\""]

["31:30,040","31:36,500","\"Yeah, this this game very very rarely brings you to a halt. Yeah, I know there's some specific parts\""]
["31:36,500","31:38,080","\"but\""]
["31:38,080","31:43,880","\"Damn, you're doing that with it. I just realized I was like are you playing on a like PC and keyboard?\""]
["31:43,880","31:49,300","\"But no you're using a ps4 yeah, I'm okay with a controller just cuz I played like a shit ton of halo and\""]

["32:47,860","32:52,560","\"Really well wait, that's a really cringy like game design term you just use\""]
["32:52,560","32:57,760","\"Can you please just say that this game looks fricking awesome from now on can I say the game feel of this feels really good?\""]
["32:57,760","32:59,760","\"Then you say it's immersive. I\""]
["32:59,760","33:02,360","\"Would really be more comfortable\""]
["33:02,360","33:08,040","\"Immersive open world game feel is pretty nice game feel is destroyed as a word forever\""]
["33:10,000","33:16,720","\"What about like something like what about Dark Souls like or rogue like or fucking it's a bit of a disa\""]
["33:16,720","33:19,120","\"It's like the Dark Souls of rogue likes\""]
["33:19,120","33:27,160","\"Dark Souls is a meme in itself. This is the Dark Souls of Pokemon games. You know whenever I see someone use Dark Souls in a review\""]
["33:27,160","33:32,020","\"I immediately think they're being ironic until I see where it came from your problem is you're reading game reviews\""]
["33:32,020","33:39,440","\"Never do that. No, I only do it cuz funny joke humor. Okay. I don't actually care. Okay. I've never looked at a reviewer and been like\""]
["33:39,440","33:41,700","\"Huh your opinion is valid to me\""]
["33:41,700","33:47,260","\"Cuz I don't care about reviews on on the internet the only reviewers I like watching our\""]
["33:47,260","33:50,220","\"People on YouTube epic critics\""]
["33:50,220","33:56,560","\"Fair listen if you're not someone who's like thoroughly entertaining to watch\""]
["33:56,560","34:02,580","\"And you're just posting long novels online about like problems in games. I'm not reading your article dude\""]
["34:02,580","34:07,280","\"Or ma'am. I think the biggest problem is that they don't say anything useful\""]
["34:07,540","34:10,200","\"They all just say exactly what you expect them to say\""]
["34:10,200","34:15,120","\"I feel like a lot of them don't play the game either because if you read these articles\""]
["34:15,120","34:19,560","\"They have a lot to say about their first level experience, but they don't play beyond that. Yeah\""]
["34:19,560","34:21,540","\"Yeah, at the same time\""]
["34:21,540","34:22,620","\"It's I don't know\""]
["34:22,620","34:28,800","\"I feel like as a reviewer or even as people like us that just play a zillion trillion games that it you kind of\""]
["34:28,800","34:36,100","\"You kind of just get that you do and I will say after after being a pro gamer for as long as I have been\""]
["34:36,100","34:41,440","\"I do often feel like I'll play like 10 minutes of a game or something and I'll be like okay\""]
["34:41,440","34:46,740","\"I know what this is about you know if I'm playing an open-world game and it starts like scattering the same objectives\""]
["34:46,740","34:50,620","\"All over the map. I'm like okay. I get I kind of know what this is\""]
["34:50,620","34:56,340","\"Bothers me you know I can put up with a lot and like games and redundancy doesn't bother me. It's done well\""]
["34:56,340","35:00,380","\"I know it's fucked up to say but if a game's fun and they're doing repetition\""]
["35:00,380","35:03,740","\"Like I'm okay with that if they follow a formula. I'm fine with that\""]
["35:03,820","35:09,500","\"It's just that the one thing I hate in open-world games is you're gonna get that repetition no matter what\""]
["35:09,500","35:14,740","\"But it's how they do it. That's really annoying like is it shallow or is it like the repetition?\""]
["35:14,740","35:16,420","\"There's quite a lot of stuff to do\""]
["35:16,420","35:23,060","\"Comparative to just like four things that are repeated over and over. Oh BT splatter in people by the way. Oh really? Yeah, that's cool\""]
["35:23,060","35:27,620","\"He came in to kick some a all an open-world game needs is fun movement\""]
["35:27,620","35:30,300","\"Then you can have fun moving from thing to thing\""]
["35:30,300","35:34,160","\"Yeah, or fun mechanics are just like breath of the wild is a good example of that\""]
["35:34,160","35:35,920","\"Yeah sliding down on your shield is good\""]
["35:35,920","35:40,880","\"Breath of the wild is very sandboxy and I don't want to get into like this rant because I have a lot to say about the game\""]
["35:40,880","35:46,960","\"And I don't think people give a shit, but overall I would say yeah, it feels good for an open world game\""]
["35:46,960","35:53,520","\"It's the most sandboxy fun style of open world and I guess another one that I had a horrible experience with but I still vouch\""]
["35:53,520","36:00,100","\"By it was horizon zero dawn. That was actually pretty fun. Never played it. Really? Was that the redhead girl?\""]
["36:00,100","36:02,260","\"Yeah, I saw that game and it looked kind of cool\""]
["36:02,260","36:05,320","\"But it just seemed like one of those games that I'd play and then immediately forget\""]
["36:05,320","36:08,260","\"There's a lot that I left in the boot of my car and forgot about it till now\""]
["36:08,260","36:09,580","\"Really?\""]

["36:12,580","36:19,140","\"Yeah, that's what you're gonna be playing. You just wait for the sequel the squeal that gave me the fucking ton of shit back\""]
["36:19,140","36:23,060","\"Yeah, also, yeah, we're sorry for sorry for uh\""]
["36:23,060","36:25,660","\"Too much game design talk\""]
