["03:02,500","03:07,860","\"Spinball feels more like the world of actually I have to say something there is a really funny sonic comic\""]
["03:07,860","03:10,100","\"- Sonic comic? - It's Sonic Fleetway.\""]
["03:10,100","03:12,080","\"It was like, I don't know if it's a brand,\""]
["03:12,080","03:15,060","\"but if you look up Sonic the Hedgehog Fleetway comic,\""]
["03:15,060","03:18,200","\"it was a British comic, and they were making Sonic,\""]
["03:18,200","03:21,140","\"they made him ruthless and extremely mean.\""]
["03:21,140","03:24,180","\"Like when Tails was like, \"\"Sonic, I almost died back there.\"\"\""]
["03:24,180","03:25,500","\"He's like, \"\"Good.\"\"\""]
["03:25,500","03:29,300","\"And he'll say stuff like, \"\"Sonic, we need to help our friends.\"\"\""]
["03:29,300","03:32,180","\"He would just be like, \"\"They're not my friends.\"\"\""]
["03:32,180","03:33,020","\"- Geez.\""]
["03:33,020","03:34,380","\"- He was mean, but it was really funny.\""]
["03:34,380","03:35,420","\"- It was a bastard, huh?\""]
["03:35,420","03:38,000","\"I don't know, look up, you could probably discern more stuff,\""]
["03:38,000","03:41,380","\"but when he's actually supersonic, he's deranged.\""]
["03:41,380","03:43,980","\"Like he's like, you don't hit the Joker.\""]
["03:43,980","03:45,460","\"- Yeah, he becomes crazy.\""]
["03:45,460","03:46,700","\"Like he actually comes like wacky,\""]
["03:46,700","03:48,380","\"and he's like, I'm gonna kill everyone who I say,\""]
["03:48,380","03:49,900","\"and it's just like, it was really dark.\""]
["03:49,900","03:53,140","\"And Sega was like, we wanna squeaky clean,\""]
["03:53,140","03:55,700","\"like, family-friendly fanbase.\""]
["03:55,700","03:56,740","\"I need to get this story.\""]
["03:56,740","03:58,340","\"- I would start to use a big knife\""]
["03:58,340","04:00,380","\"and like carve into people.\""]
["04:00,380","04:03,940","\"- There's tons of new grounds cartoons of him carving tails.\""]
["04:03,940","04:10,100","\"Really wanted to look at that stop it go fucking walled dope. I don't need to get so angry about it\""]
["04:10,100","04:15,020","\"It's just annoying. I'm trying to get in here. I try to make you happy boy. You're level there there you go\""]
["04:15,020","04:18,140","\"Why are you having fun?\""]
["04:18,140","04:20,140","\"More because it's annoying\""]
["04:20,140","04:22,820","\"Okay, this game has a bad game feel\""]
["04:22,820","04:27,360","\"Yeah, Zach break down to me. What would make this feel better?\""]
["04:28,020","04:32,340","\"Seagull, Seagull. I think if he had a backpack if he had no arms\""]
["04:32,340","04:39,380","\"They'd be cool. They had like cute little cabbage patch with no arms. Yeah, well Mario gives her stuff\""]
["04:39,380","04:43,860","\"He played but Sonic gives ours a seagull. He'd still listen up a more painted feel with water brush\""]
["04:43,860","04:49,700","\"You know the reality of it is the reason why Sonic isn't being played is because they've experimented too much and\""]
["04:49,700","04:54,020","\"They don't know what the fuck to do at this point. Hopefully the open world Sonic game isn't a failure\""]
["04:54,020","04:56,100","\"Yeah, I hope that's actually quite good. I'll play it\""]
["04:56,420","05:01,140","\"I mean personally like all I ever have said is like just make an open world Sonic game with characters\""]
["05:01,140","05:04,020","\"That's all anybody's wanted. I'm gonna say is make a giant open world gamer\""]
["05:04,020","05:06,880","\"You can go a zillion miles an hour and you're not running into stuff\""]
["05:06,880","05:11,500","\"They should absolutely make me and you can build momentum up and dude that stupid fucking game\""]
["05:11,500","05:17,100","\"Flash game dolphin olympics needs to play like middle school that game is fun because you actually build speed up\""]
["05:17,100","05:19,780","\"I get quicker and quicker from momentum. That's really fun. Yeah\""]
["05:19,780","05:23,300","\"Like side-scroller, but just a clever mechanic\""]
["05:23,300","05:28,720","\"Yeah, they'll make it the longer you go the faster you go you can go up ramps and stuff you please for the love of fucking god\""]
["05:28,720","05:30,720","\"It grabbed this\""]
["05:30,720","05:33,020","\"Christ I\""]
["05:33,020","05:36,500","\"Just feels fun to me. Yeah struggling to grab buttons\""]
["05:36,500","05:41,900","\"Good job Sega. I will say SEGA SEGA\""]
["05:41,900","05:47,900","\"I will say that they should make a Sonic movie to video game and\""]
["05:47,900","05:50,700","\"Rachel's wedding is definitely\""]
["05:52,180","05:57,100","\"That's where the game takes place. That's like the overworld. You play is like a place to do like she runs like\""]
["05:57,100","06:00,520","\"The the fucking king and sneak king was just trying to\""]
["06:00,520","06:05,280","\"They should be the wedding and you play all the humans be you can't play Sonic or Jell\""]
["06:05,280","06:10,760","\"Yeah, you have to switch to Tom and you just like realistic face. Yeah, you can't rock fast either\""]
["06:10,760","06:14,700","\"You're just walking normal human speed and you can talk to people at the wedding rock\""]
["06:14,700","06:20,660","\"But you can't talk to Sonic where knuckles are you know, I don't understand about that part. It's like if okay, let's say\""]
["06:21,140","06:27,460","\"You're you know whoever's directing the movie and then the production people are like you have to include this fucking wedding\""]
["06:27,460","06:32,940","\"Because the adults are gonna get bored and there's needs something and you're like you can you know disagree and just be like fine\""]
["06:32,940","06:34,740","\"Whatever I have to put in the wedding\""]
["06:34,740","06:37,860","\"Why don't they at least get that those actors to be good?\""]
["06:37,860","06:41,620","\"Why don't they get good actors and I also have them just improvise like because it's too compartmentalizer\""]
["06:41,620","06:46,140","\"It's not really I don't think there was a good real top down like all they had to do for that\""]
["06:46,140","06:48,820","\"It was like shoot the same scene like 20 times\""]
["06:48,820","06:51,780","\"Just be like improvised improvised and we'll pick the best one just fucking do it\""]
["06:51,780","06:55,500","\"I guarantee you everybody there was to go home as soon as possible sad\""]
["06:55,500","07:00,260","\"And what's fucked up is they wouldn't even view it like they did a bad job, but they don't know that they did\""]
["07:00,260","07:01,460","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["07:01,460","07:04,340","\"They would know the difference between doing a great job and an average job\""]
["07:04,340","07:09,200","\"But they're like well we shut it right it's done in the biggest problem was just that the writing was fucking awful\""]
["07:09,200","07:14,940","\"It was the writing and I think you could have edited that down a lot. It was super hammy - I think it also stopped the movie\""]
["07:14,940","07:18,420","\"Yeah, it stopped it. You just I actually started to get sleepy\""]
["07:18,420","07:23,300","\"I mean like yeah, they went on for like 10 minutes and then also that sonic dance scene went on for like 10 minutes\""]
["07:23,300","07:27,300","\"It's like what the yeah, let's just stop the plot entirely for no reason sorry to come back to it\""]
["07:27,300","07:29,700","\"It's just like we're I'm mad I'm still bad about it\""]
