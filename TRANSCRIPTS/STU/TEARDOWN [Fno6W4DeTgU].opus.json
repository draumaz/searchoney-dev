["04:31,720","04:37,920","\"Click it so there's a gas bill gas bill just dropped on the floor. Honestly, I'm not sure we can make it through the month\""]
["04:37,920","04:44,480","\"Are you getting any requests this point? We pretty much have to accept anything be creative hugs? Oh\""]

["05:08,720","05:23,820","\"You're beautiful. Oh, you're here. Oh, this is the old place. Can I get in my car and just smash into it? Oh, this is the lead\""]
["05:25,040","05:31,220","\"However, if you look around hard enough, okay, no, they said the house dude. Yeah, but I'm gonna just like warm\""]
["05:31,220","05:35,440","\"It's easy to smash it rude. You can't blame a guy. Oh, what was this? Oh?\""]
["05:35,440","05:38,560","\"That's an anchor\""]
["05:38,560","05:40,600","\"Okay, that's a little tough\""]
["05:40,600","05:47,480","\"That's not though. It's a protected cultural heritage sweet that is a historical building and this is a shady job\""]
["05:47,480","05:52,600","\"And you should just turn back now. Maybe I should look propane. It's pretty unethical pick them up and throw them\""]
["05:52,960","05:54,960","\"They explode yeah, perhaps\""]
["05:54,960","05:57,840","\"throw that yeah\""]

["06:09,880","06:17,120","\"Yes, you just want those little explode. Yeah, not you know try the knock. I don't see any cultural heritage in here\""]
["06:17,120","06:24,120","\"No, no, no, no, wow. Oh fuck. Oh, I'll show you burning\""]
["06:24,120","06:28,360","\"You can light it all the bar easy dukes\""]
["06:28,360","06:30,200","\"Oh\""]
["06:30,200","06:35,640","\"That looks so satisfying. Yeah, although it's like why would I yeah? Why would I want to put out the fire? Yeah, what the bird?\""]
["06:35,640","06:41,580","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we need this to destroy the chimney anyway, exactly\""]
["06:43,400","06:45,160","\"Oh, really?\""]
["06:45,160","06:49,620","\"That's tough. That is kind of tough. What do you suppose? What's what else do you have besides that?\""]
["06:49,620","06:56,160","\"How are the area dude? There must be something else you could possibly look under horizon. What is that?\""]
["06:56,160","07:01,340","\"Can I operate these now wait just one second?\""]
["07:01,340","07:03,900","\"Wait a second\""]
["07:03,900","07:12,020","\"Right click the lower. Oh, you just drove over the propane\""]
["07:12,020","07:14,020","\"Oh\""]
["07:14,020","07:18,700","\"His thing on fire. No, it's just that little area good. Just join the tree while you're at it\""]
["07:18,700","07:21,300","\"You're being such a dick right now\""]
["07:21,300","07:24,880","\"Well, you might as well. I mean if nobody ever sees the trees. Oh my god\""]
["07:24,880","07:29,540","\"Over that tree - you have to imagine all the locals are like\""]
["07:29,540","07:32,420","\"Destroyed destroyed my own\""]
["07:32,420","07:39,300","\"Vehicle doing that. Oh shit. You lost the thing. Yeah, I lost the like the bulldozer front. That's amazing\""]
["07:41,300","07:43,300","\"Slow down the game a bit though\""]
["07:43,300","07:48,340","\"He just like a kid just rampant. I don't know if we can do this without the bulldozer front\""]
["07:48,340","07:52,360","\"But there's other bulldozers around. Yeah, I think you give you a second one. You just got rid of the chimney\""]
["07:52,360","07:57,780","\"That was the worst part. Yeah. Yeah, see if you could just drive around and just get in that a fall under his own weight now\""]
["07:57,780","07:59,940","\"No, I don't think there's a side of the leftover here\""]
["07:59,940","08:02,860","\"I don't think things buckle under their own weight in this all this whole time\""]
["08:02,860","08:05,980","\"I thought that they were gonna have that that would be really cool. Oh\""]
["08:08,180","08:14,260","\"I know gonna have to do the deck points for that. I mean it's all I don't think games can actually do that\""]
["08:14,260","08:16,780","\"Kind of calculating. Oh\""]
["08:16,780","08:22,500","\"But they will someday they will I'm sure he would like it to do that. Oh\""]
["08:22,500","08:26,500","\"Yes\""]
["08:26,500","08:29,140","\"It just needed a little friendly push\""]
["08:29,140","08:31,940","\"Wow\""]
["08:31,940","08:33,940","\"Yes\""]
["08:33,980","08:40,900","\"You're breaking the light and now look I scoop down look it says it's 4.1 meters too tall\""]
["08:40,900","08:44,440","\"Look I'll just\""]
["08:44,440","08:47,560","\"Look at it go\""]
["08:47,560","08:52,960","\"It's so it does have some kind of physics with those big pieces. Yes does. That's great now. I'm impressed again\""]
["08:52,960","08:56,120","\"That's so fucking cool\""]
["08:56,120","09:00,000","\"Die oh\""]
["09:00,000","09:02,000","\"Yes, goop it. I\""]

["09:06,000","09:09,120","\"What doesn't feel right?\""]
["09:09,120","09:13,000","\"It's just morally just I can't believe you do that to the historical building\""]
["09:13,000","09:17,800","\"I mean I want to do that to the historical building, but I'd sure do it to the voxel historic\""]
["09:17,800","09:23,920","\"It must be kind of really fun tearing down buildings except for doing all the paperwork and\""]
["09:23,920","09:28,180","\"And planning and worrying that people might get hurt when you're the crane operator\""]
["09:28,180","09:31,840","\"You don't really have to worry about that you just show up and do the fun stuff\""]
["09:31,840","09:35,160","\"What if you accidentally smash the wrong kid or something?\""]
["09:35,160","09:37,840","\"Smash the right kid\""]
["09:37,840","09:45,420","\"If you like hit if you're supposed to like take that a vacant building instead you you attack a fully occupied apartment building\""]
["09:45,420","09:52,680","\"You're part of a complex. Yeah, then what then what then what tomes that'd be horrible homes. Tomes get to your escape vehicle\""]
["09:52,680","09:56,340","\"Well mission accomplished. Oh fuck I\""]
["09:56,340","10:00,400","\"Better escape. Yeah, you better escape still left of you\""]
["10:00,400","10:02,040","\"Stop climbing that tree, you go hooligan.\""]
["10:02,040","10:03,360","\"Let's get out of this.\""]
["10:03,360","10:05,320","\"Let's get out of this scene.\""]
["10:05,320","10:10,400","\"Do you ever play 3D.game heroes?\""]
["10:10,400","10:15,400","\"It sounds really familiar, but I don't think I that was a PS3 game.\""]
["10:15,400","10:15,600","\"Right.\""]
["10:15,600","10:17,960","\"I was like a weird Zelda clone with 3D graphics.\""]

["22:31,360","22:31,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["22:31,860","22:35,860","\"Yeah, it's a good stupid. There's a really stupid really old new girl's culture called loud jump\""]
["22:35,860","22:40,360","\"Oh, and all the characters left the same way. There's a little suck up with anything away\""]
["22:40,360","22:49,140","\"And I just loops on that over and over yeah called loud jog on new grills go give it loud junk\""]
["22:49,140","22:55,760","\"Yeah, it's a self it's a parody of self-punk which is already about idea. Yeah, it's a really bizarre thing to choose to parody\""]
["22:55,760","22:59,140","\"Because it's not really a parody. It's just like a tribute, but it is kind of a parody, but it's like\""]
["22:59,740","23:04,660","\"South Park itself was already kind of a parrot. Oh, come on. It will let me do a jump onto the tree\""]

["23:48,480","23:55,700","\"Sad but one were like Walter makes Jesse eat the worm to get on the bus. You read that episode. Yeah, there's loyalty\""]
["23:55,700","23:59,660","\"Oh, I hate that episode. I thought it would like it stood out like it was kind of weird\""]
["23:59,660","24:02,940","\"But we're the more else who says you have to eat the worm just you know\""]
["24:02,940","24:06,760","\"It's like you have to eat all it seems like it's just like a bullshit filler episode\""]
["24:06,760","24:12,100","\"But it's more so of like good characters development like it's just a back and forth of those two characters together\""]
["24:12,100","24:14,100","\"I think yeah, what can find you?\""]
["24:14,100","24:20,100","\"Uh-uh, or does that just mean like once I do that I have to escape. I don't know I\""]

["24:53,700","25:01,900","\"I'm not sure. Oh, okay. That's scary helicopter. When I first saw the Lego movie, I really did think it was all stop motion\""]

["25:06,660","25:14,960","\"Yeah, no, it's amazing. I hate that movie though. I had a lot of guys a movie it's fucking lame\""]

["25:43,160","25:48,380","\"And that works what do you think the weirdest movies is that you've watched the budget like let's say necessarily not great\""]
["25:48,380","25:50,940","\"But just a movie that you've happened to watch a bunch of times\""]
["25:50,940","25:52,780","\"Oh\""]

["26:49,340","26:52,660","\"We used to say this isn't that fun of like a challenge mechanic\""]
