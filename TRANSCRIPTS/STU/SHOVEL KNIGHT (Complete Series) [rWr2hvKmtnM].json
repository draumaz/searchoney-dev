["05:49,800","05:56,520","\"Okay, okay. It's just you press down. I've been doing it wrong. I've been pressing down and attack everyone makes mistakes\""]

["06:03,000","06:05,000","\"I totally forgot how that\""]
["06:05,000","06:11,040","\"Spring mechanic worked. Oh shoot wait. No, this is a secret area, right? We should sing that all knights look the same to you Tomar\""]
["06:11,040","06:15,400","\"All right, Lyle if you were to delete everything to do with this game. How would you go about doing it?\""]
["06:15,400","06:21,800","\"I'd start with that guy. That's actually just a given with that big fat green bat look at his fucking face\""]
["06:21,800","06:24,400","\"Yeah, see you did it for me\""]
["06:24,800","06:30,940","\"Sertie began he killed me. Oh, that was a secret. That was the secret. You should know you can rejoin\""]
["06:30,940","06:33,480","\"Well, let me you press a can a\""]
["06:33,480","06:37,080","\"Uh, maybe it takes a bit press. I\""]
["06:37,080","06:42,200","\"Don't know maybe I'm fucked you've run out of world. Maybe I can rejoin here\""]
["06:42,200","06:46,520","\"Is there a certain amount of like lot maybe it's after I do that what can you get it? Oh?\""]
["06:46,520","06:50,600","\"I think it might take a bit of Tomars health if you rejoin\""]
["06:50,600","06:55,080","\"So it's because how Mars like one is because I only go back you missed a secret\""]
["06:55,080","06:58,520","\"Go down. I don't know how to go down there left\""]
["06:58,520","07:01,360","\"Like go down here. Yes. Oh\""]
["07:01,360","07:05,160","\"On the top of the ledge right to right below you and go to the right\""]
["07:05,160","07:07,960","\"You think it's just all\""]
["07:14,800","07:15,800","\"Goddamn bastard.\""]
["07:15,800","07:18,840","\"By the way, be careful jumping on the checkpoints like that, Tomar.\""]
["07:18,840","07:20,400","\"You can't actually break them.\""]
["07:20,400","07:21,400","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["07:21,400","07:22,400","\"Really?\""]
["07:22,400","07:24,400","\"Not those, but there are ones that you can't burn.\""]
["07:24,400","07:26,000","\"Oh, and that's just like a cool like...\""]
["07:26,000","07:27,000","\"It's just like a look at me.\""]
["07:27,000","07:28,000","\"It's a self challenge.\""]
["07:28,000","07:29,000","\"Kind of.\""]
["07:29,000","07:31,200","\"It gives you coins if you break the checkpoint.\""]
["07:31,200","07:34,400","\"Like if you're really confident that you can just fucking do it.\""]
["07:34,400","07:36,000","\"Delicious Jewels.\""]
["07:36,000","07:37,000","\"Fuck.\""]
["07:37,000","07:43,840","\"I would say when it comes to like gems and jewels, there's certain things that...\""]
["07:43,840","07:49,040","\"shouldn't be appetizing in any way, shape or form, but it's like, I don't know, they're colorful.\""]
["07:49,040","07:53,040","\"They're like, like, fruits or something. I don't- there's something about the human eye that when\""]
["07:53,040","07:57,600","\"you see jewels, you're like, \"\"I wanna bite into that.\"\" It's because they're inherently satisfying- uh-oh,\""]
["07:57,600","08:03,520","\"get my little jewels. Also, that's a problem that everyone runs into when they're making a game.\""]
["08:03,520","08:08,480","\"What? Making things look delicious? No, making like something that's not cliche like jewels,\""]
["08:08,480","08:13,120","\"but then realizing that jewels are cliche because they're perfect. Yeah, and people want to chew on\""]
["08:13,120","08:18,800","\"I think you can rejoin. Oh, yeah, my bed when I was younger. Do you ever watch that show the crystal maze?\""]
["08:18,800","08:24,300","\"No, maybe that was a European thing. What was it about? It was literally it was weird\""]
["08:24,300","08:28,920","\"It was a it was like a game show where you go through all these different like trials and cool stuff\""]
["08:28,920","08:32,240","\"And then at the end of the show they give you like a thousand dollars, which is nothing\""]
["08:32,240","08:35,080","\"But they also give you a really cool crystal because it was called the crystal maze\""]
["08:35,080","08:37,920","\"Hmm, but I always wanted that crystal growing up\""]
["08:37,920","08:42,000","\"Yeah, some some like 38 year old has one\""]
["08:42,560","08:45,680","\"Yeah, it's meaningless forgot about it. Yeah\""]
["08:45,680","08:53,080","\"And you're giving it to a kid too, so that kid probably like fucking took it to social studies class and lost it\""]
["08:53,080","08:58,160","\"No, no, no, sorry the crystal maze was an adult show. Oh, it's so an adult not a crystal and those people are dead now\""]
["08:58,160","09:02,280","\"Oh, okay, so some wait is there anything to the left? I need to adjust my my\""]
["09:02,280","09:09,620","\"Rhetorical scenario where now it's a 78 year old person that has the crystal. Yeah, see that changes a lot\""]
["09:09,620","09:12,340","\"Is this just backtracking or is this a secret area?\""]
["09:12,340","09:17,500","\"It's like a secret you even got those jewels yet. That's true. See if you think about like a 36 year old with a jewel\""]
["09:17,500","09:21,340","\"It's not very good, but if you think about like someone older with a jewel, then you're like, that's funny\""]
["09:21,340","09:26,980","\"All I know is shiny things are just cool. That's why magpies are fucking cool\""]
["09:26,980","09:34,780","\"I'm glad they added a little co-op mode to this. It's real cool. I've always thought like more kind of retroy games need to have it. Oh\""]
["09:36,300","09:39,100","\"Black Knight oh that this nage very well. Oh\""]
["09:39,100","09:44,860","\"I always knew you were going to make a joke about the color of my skin oh\""]
["09:44,860","09:52,200","\"So the boss is actually have twice as much health because it's co-op really yeah\""]
["09:52,200","09:55,180","\"That doesn't make any sense\""]
["09:55,180","09:59,860","\"Yeah, cuz he got two guys wailing on him. Just I'm just having a little silly troll\""]
["09:59,860","10:03,580","\"Dude we're kicking ass. Oh you\""]
["10:05,020","10:07,520","\"That was sick. I had no idea you could do that\""]
["10:07,520","10:15,440","\"Uh-huh dickhead. Yeah, just hit his punishment when he does that like stand next to him and hit him. He's holding me\""]
["10:15,440","10:20,220","\"He shoveled at me. How come everyone has a damn shovel? Yeah\""]
["10:20,220","10:28,780","\"Seems like the trick to like I'm stupid being good at a game like this or any game really that's even remotely challenging\""]
["10:28,780","10:32,460","\"It's just you you worry about not getting hit before you worry about\""]
["10:33,100","10:39,780","\"Hitting a thing this is it to a more you got fucking dug on we're so stupid and ugly. Let's try that again\""]
["10:39,780","10:41,980","\"What do you say we got this grab the loot?\""]
["10:41,980","10:45,220","\"Was that a loot crate?\""]
["10:45,220","10:51,580","\"Yeah, let's just focus on top hits just focus on unless unless he's doing his stabbing then try to get aside\""]
["10:51,580","10:53,820","\"Yeah, just focus on getting epic gamer loot\""]
["10:53,820","11:00,320","\"Ever everyone was so on board with loot crate at the very start and then they slowly realized they shitty it was I\""]
["11:00,820","11:05,160","\"I feel like something like that is bound to just be like unsold inventory of stuff.\""]
["11:05,160","11:06,420","\"Yes, it is.\""]
["11:06,420","11:08,760","\"I, uh, have I ever told my loot crate?\""]
["11:08,760","11:09,520","\"Yeah, you did.\""]
["11:09,520","11:10,720","\"Thing on this, okay.\""]
["11:10,720","11:14,580","\"But basically I did a, I did a brand deal with loot crate where I'm like,\""]
["11:14,580","11:16,040","\"\"\"Oh, he hit a bag again!\"\"\""]
["11:16,040","11:18,580","\"This is definitely not something I would ever buy.\""]
["11:18,580","11:20,980","\"Can I make fun of it? And they were like, \"\"Yeah.\"\"\""]
["11:20,980","11:22,780","\"And I was like, \"\"Okay, cool.\"\"\""]
["11:22,780","11:27,260","\"So I made these weird videos just making fun of other people's loot crate videos.\""]
["11:27,260","11:30,760","\"And then on the third one, they just like canceled it without telling me.\""]
["11:30,760","11:32,360","\"after I had made the video.\""]
["11:32,360","11:33,200","\"- Fucking bad.\""]
["11:33,200","11:35,280","\"- So I just added like a fucking two minute long\""]
["11:35,280","11:37,360","\"masturbation scene to it.\""]
["11:37,360","11:41,880","\"And the funny thing was, is the item that was in correlation\""]
["11:41,880","11:45,480","\"with the masturbation scene was like this fucking,\""]
["11:45,480","11:46,800","\"it was like an oven mitt.\""]
["11:46,800","11:49,080","\"And I said it was like a masturbation gauntlet.\""]
["11:49,080","11:51,360","\"And they actually had to recall that fucking thing\""]
["11:51,360","11:54,040","\"because it was lighting on fire when people were reaching\""]
