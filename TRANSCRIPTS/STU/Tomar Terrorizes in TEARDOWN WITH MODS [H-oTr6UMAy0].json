["00:10,000","00:11,940","\"Okay, so...\""]
["00:11,940","00:12,840","\"I've been hogging it.\""]
["00:12,840","00:14,840","\"I'll leave for one...\""]

["00:16,000","00:17,600","\"Tomor takes control.\""]
["00:17,600","00:19,440","\"You can go next, loyo.\""]
["00:19,440","00:20,120","\"Alright.\""]
["00:20,120","00:21,080","\"Loyo!\""]
["00:21,080","00:23,440","\"Slash radius.\""]
["00:23,440","00:24,640","\"Oh, the radius is-\""]
["00:24,640","00:26,200","\"Oh, turn the radius up, dude.\""]
["00:26,200","00:28,640","\"Turn that up, and then it'll make massive, thick slices.\""]
["00:28,640","00:36,240","\"He's up, but force down maybe yeah and travel distance maybe as far as you can go right click stops time if you turn it to zero\""]
["00:36,240","00:39,160","\"And if you let go of right click oh\""]
["00:39,160","00:42,080","\"Wow oh\""]
["00:42,080","00:52,080","\"I think I went too far. It's just just click quickly and then it won't do the slow motion\""]
["00:52,080","00:56,040","\"Oh\""]
["00:56,200","00:58,200","\"Yeah, I guess I didn't have enough force\""]
["00:58,200","01:04,120","\"It definitely causes less lag like this, but yeah\""]
["01:04,120","01:12,600","\"Oh my god, we just gotta tune this then what does the force do?\""]
["01:12,600","01:18,560","\"That's a good point and turn the radio down a little bit turn force up full. Oh\""]
["01:18,560","01:25,640","\"Yeah, look okay, so it's more to do with the force than the size so the distance is definitely like\""]
["01:25,640","01:27,640","\"How far it goes?\""]
["01:27,640","01:29,640","\"Whoa!\""]

["01:33,640","01:35,640","\"Oh my god!\""]
["01:35,640","01:41,640","\"Yeah, how did you change the angle by the way?\""]

["01:59,720","02:03,880","\"Whoo, your cousin by quite a bit of damage.\""]
["02:03,880","02:08,400","\"Don't ask the world's race center. You can no, twice it up before\""]
["02:08,400","02:14,520","\"falls. I don't account. Oh my god. Whoa.\""]
["02:14,520","02:18,280","\"So wrong. Well done. Pretty sick.\""]

["02:22,920","02:25,320","\"I wonder can we get- oh do we haven't tried the airplane yet?\""]
["02:25,320","02:27,960","\"Are you right? We have that Boeing.\""]
["02:27,960","02:29,160","\"We gotta try the airplane.\""]

["03:00,700","03:04,000","\"That's the whole technically the whole of a plane, I guess.\""]
["03:04,000","03:05,000","\"Oh, it's peeling back here.\""]
["03:05,000","03:07,000","\"These fuckers open that window.\""]

["03:49,380","03:55,900","\"This is crazy. Yeah rascal it some might say it's making all the little look\""]
["03:55,900","04:01,340","\"this individual airbags for each or oxygen masks for each seat that's so\""]
["04:01,340","04:06,380","\"awesome so what if I just wonder what say on the news oh my god\""]
["04:06,380","04:09,020","\"what's the final slice one final slice\""]
["04:12,020","04:13,020","\"Ooh.\""]
["04:13,020","04:14,020","\"Aw.\""]
["04:14,020","04:15,180","\"Oh, didn't it re-teleport you?\""]

["04:55,860","04:59,860","\"All right, maybe I should restart\""]
["04:59,860","05:04,700","\"The fact that it's a flying plane is pretty cool put a velociraptor on\""]
["05:04,700","05:08,040","\"You could get an angry snake. You could say I'm tired\""]
["05:08,500","05:10,800","\"I'm pretty lethargic about this\""]
["05:10,800","05:19,660","\"Pretty lethargic about this velociraptor on this flying vehicle. Oh my god Tomar. Is that necessary dude?\""]

["05:33,980","05:35,980","\"I already got murdered\""]
["05:35,980","05:44,180","\"You had it trained on him Tomar. Why did you hesitate spawn King Kong? Yeah King Kong\""]
["05:44,180","05:51,220","\"No on the plane. Yeah. Yeah. This is a bad idea interesting experiment. Oh you click. Oh\""]
["05:51,220","05:58,080","\"Tomar Tomar right click. Oh, oh you get the plane\""]
["06:01,340","06:07,180","\"Who's are to change ammo? Oh dude got different ammo. Yeah. Yeah for the air strikes dude. We gotta try that. Oh\""]
["06:07,180","06:13,320","\"God, but he's on you. Okay. You gotta kill Tomar\""]
["06:13,320","06:17,540","\"You got to stop hesitating you gonna do the air stray\""]

["06:28,420","06:36,820","\"That'll teach him and I don't think I've compromised the hole. Yeah, no you're good. Yeah try that air strength try the different\""]
["06:36,820","06:49,840","\"Trialled oh cluster bomb. Oh my god. It's decompressing\""]
["06:49,840","06:55,460","\"Jesus oh that cluster bomb did a lot more than I expected\""]
["06:56,300","07:01,820","\"It's right different ball train a palm. I love that all the alarms are going off of the cockpit\""]
["07:01,820","07:06,940","\"Try asin that's still fine by the Geneva Conventions, right right click and see where you're aiming\""]
["07:06,940","07:10,300","\"Now click\""]
["07:10,300","07:12,620","\"Whoa\""]
["07:12,620","07:15,300","\"Ooh\""]
["07:15,300","07:19,720","\"Wow, oh fuck that did a lot of damage there\""]
["07:19,720","07:24,380","\"Yeah, it's almost like did it react with the engine like is there that much\""]

["07:47,100","07:50,100","\"Yeah, shoot a bunch. Oh\""]
["07:51,300","07:55,120","\"Man that's a sturdy built plane not bad\""]
["07:55,120","08:00,060","\"The cockpit just absolutely just knock them out of there\""]
["08:00,060","08:05,820","\"Remember next time you fly and your plane is shaking around\""]
["08:05,820","08:16,820","\"There when it happened if you knock the cockpit out. I wonder what happens\""]
["08:16,820","08:19,340","\"There was some turbulence\""]
["08:20,060","08:22,060","\"It's really ripping up. Oh\""]
["08:22,060","08:28,880","\"Wow, they're still writhing velociraptors on board too\""]
["08:28,880","08:32,780","\"We gotta make it to the cockpit\""]
["08:32,780","08:38,540","\"Look at that. Is that the cockpit? Yeah, she looks like it\""]
["08:38,540","08:42,440","\"Okay, let's go back to air strike real quick. Oh\""]
["08:42,440","08:45,980","\"My\""]
["08:45,980","08:52,060","\"Let's finish this up. The 105 nanometers should be our millimeter should be enough, right?\""]
["08:52,060","08:54,580","\"We missed\""]
["08:54,580","08:58,340","\"Tomer go back to your view\""]
["08:58,340","09:03,980","\"So cool\""]
["09:03,980","09:14,300","\"What's all collapsing is it really it feels like it my brain made it feel like it\""]
["09:14,300","09:23,120","\"Don't worry you have a jetpack you got a jump. I'm getting suction. Are you really it seemed like it?\""]
["09:23,120","09:32,720","\"To reblow out the entire front of the plane so the only the tail remains that guy remains and he doesn't care\""]
["09:32,720","09:36,320","\"He's just he's chilling. He's like it. It's not really not that bad\""]
