["04:52,420","04:59,180","\"She was one so she was just like an American student in Japan and she was just like oh a weird little shoot out in the woods\""]
["04:59,180","05:03,820","\"I'll go do that so she did it and then they know and knows who the fuck she is to this day\""]
["05:03,820","05:10,060","\"That's weird when she step up and say I did it from no idea. She probably doesn't fucking remember she did it\""]
["05:10,060","05:15,460","\"You sure she's not the biggest resident you will fan today. Maybe I'm completely fucking wrong. I don't know\""]
["05:15,460","05:20,620","\"That's interesting. That's awesome. Like resident evils or James. That's the kind of game theories. I want\""]
["05:20,620","05:24,780","\"That probably was a game theory at some now. I'm Carlos. I suck\""]
["05:24,780","05:29,820","\"I'm pretty sure I looked into this before though, and the only guy they found was the guy I did Barry Burton\""]
["05:29,820","05:33,180","\"And he was just some guy was like, yeah, that was weird. What was that?\""]

["05:47,020","05:51,340","\"No, I only have Carlos items in here. I just looked it up. Yeah, no, I was right\""]
["05:51,340","05:54,980","\"But she wasn't American. She was she was some Russian girl living in Japan\""]
["05:54,980","06:00,680","\"Apparently she could barely even speak English. So there's she doesn't even know about Resident Evil. Oh, that's weird\""]
["06:00,680","06:03,660","\"Isn't that fucking crazy that is crazy her name was\""]
["06:04,500","06:06,500","\"But she sounded like she could speak English\""]
["06:06,500","06:09,060","\"You really think\""]
["06:09,060","06:16,700","\"Is fucking good you like that? I mean it's good enough. The Japanese would be like wow we need to issue\""]

["06:22,980","06:27,900","\"But yeah, say what you just did that voice acting was what we would call culturally sensitive. I think you\""]
["06:30,100","06:32,500","\"Looks like you're not gonna be able to go through that stare transition\""]
["06:32,500","06:41,380","\"Her name is spelled I and easy H and in is but just color easy age. Yeah, I call it easy age. Okay, ZH\""]

["06:47,980","07:00,020","\"Where to find her no the only know her first name. Oh, oh, okay, that's so fucking bizarre\""]
["07:00,020","07:04,220","\"You think like someone who worked on the game would have kept like records of everybody.\""]
["07:04,220","07:05,720","\"Yeah, no, that's really weird.\""]
["07:05,720","07:07,020","\"I mean this was like PlayStation.\""]
["07:07,020","07:09,420","\"I don't think they really knew what game voice acting was.\""]
["07:09,420","07:11,720","\"They probably thought it was like a full motion video thing.\""]
["07:11,720","07:12,220","\"That's true.\""]
["07:12,220","07:14,420","\"This is like the Wild West of 3D video games.\""]
["07:14,420","07:15,820","\"They showed them what is it?\""]
["07:15,820","07:16,620","\"Night Terror?\""]
["07:16,620","07:18,020","\"And they're like, that's what our game's going to be.\""]
["07:18,020","07:20,020","\"Oh fuck, I didn't expect you to be there.\""]
["07:20,020","07:21,220","\"I heard there before.\""]

["07:29,720","07:34,480","\"Yeah, you stomp them. That's cool. Well, you're already grabbing your tent\""]
["07:34,480","07:39,480","\"We're not even like two seconds in wait. What's the zombies? This is the door is a door right there?\""]
["07:39,480","07:45,800","\"Use your healing item your tinnies are right there. No, you don't need it. Yeah, I'm good right there that that's not ours\""]
["07:45,800","07:51,800","\"I don't think it's a try it. I'm try the there's a perfectly good wall of fire in front of you\""]
["07:51,800","07:53,800","\"You can walk you to fire extinguisher\""]
["07:53,800","07:57,080","\"Yeah, yeah, I'm wondering what exactly today\""]

["08:07,200","08:10,720","\"The easy way outside is blocked off\""]
["08:10,720","08:17,700","\"Okay finish that game of chess. That's probably the ultimate puzzle nemesis smashes through you want to play\""]
["08:17,700","08:24,100","\"Cool, you're not actually that bad of a guy then he starts and then he fucking bashes you with a stun\""]
["08:24,100","08:26,360","\"(laughing)\""]

["08:53,200","08:55,200","\"You were fine dude\""]
["08:55,200","09:00,320","\"Wait till you're down to the point where you have flashing red and you're puking a blood. That's when you should heal\""]
["09:00,320","09:04,480","\"And your eyes and ears are bleeding and your nose is bleeding and your mouth is bleeding\""]
