["00:02,000","00:04,880","\"Okay, you can do it you can do it oh\""]
["00:04,880","00:09,680","\"Hey, there you go. Did I do it?\""]
["00:09,680","00:17,640","\"Well, how much does it do? I actually don't know if you got it cuz I remember he says something different when you get it\""]
["00:17,640","00:19,640","\"My wife\""]
["00:19,640","00:22,440","\"She's gonna die probably\""]
["00:22,440","00:29,280","\"But we talked about it earlier. I don't get behind the idea of telling someone don't ever make anything again\""]
["00:29,280","00:32,540","\"I think of like back when Christian was a bigger deal\""]
["00:32,540","00:35,660","\"and like\""]
["00:35,660","00:38,060","\"The car that there was a lot of people\""]
["00:38,060","00:44,960","\"like harassing there was a lot of people like, you know being just like obnoxious and mean and\""]
["00:44,960","00:51,380","\"It ruins it for everybody if you like having some person that you find entertaining\""]
["00:51,380","00:56,780","\"What the the ending way and like hating themselves and hiding under a chair somewhere\""]
["00:57,540","01:02,220","\"Because they've been chased off by people. It's not fun for anybody. No, it's not fun for them\""]
["01:02,220","01:05,300","\"It's not fun for people who want if you enjoy their antics. Yeah\""]
["01:05,300","01:09,700","\"If you want to laugh at them like a goof like that I don't think that's wrong personally\""]
["01:09,700","01:12,700","\"There you go, but I\""]
["01:12,700","01:14,700","\"Feel like when you're actively\""]
["01:14,700","01:20,540","\"Trying to shut something down. It's not a good idea. I want to see what else this guy has to make\""]
["01:20,540","01:22,540","\"I want to see the next game\""]
["01:22,540","01:25,620","\"Ding-dong and I also differ on this that like\""]
["01:26,260","01:29,100","\"He liked the idea of the ye creator\""]
["01:29,100","01:35,180","\"updating it and making it better and I was like forget it move on to move on to the next thing\""]
["01:35,180","01:40,200","\"It's because I can tell this was a very big personal project to him and I'd like to at least see him\""]
["01:40,200","01:42,980","\"fully flesh out what his vision is I\""]
["01:42,980","01:47,660","\"Can give credit towards that because I think of like no man's sky no man's sky\""]
["01:47,660","01:52,620","\"I think was the boldest decision I have ever seen with a video game that it was seriously coming in and going\""]
["01:52,620","01:53,880","\"And you know what?\""]
["01:53,880","01:57,420","\"Everybody hates us, nobody trusts us, we're the laughing stock, everyone's treating us\""]
["01:57,420","02:00,560","\"like shit, nobody's going to respect us for probably years, and yet we're all going to\""]
["02:00,560","02:04,220","\"sit down anyways and try to make this game better.\""]
["02:04,220","02:07,420","\"And they did, and it worked out for them.\""]
["02:07,420","02:10,860","\"And I remember I didn't believe, I think Chris actually, you were the first person to\""]
["02:10,860","02:16,060","\"tell me about the idea of like, oh, they made it better and I was kind of like, so basically\""]
["02:16,060","02:17,060","\"they just did it.\""]
["02:17,060","02:20,140","\"When they allowed the functionality, they promised originally that wasn't in there.\""]
["02:20,140","02:22,860","\"But it seems like everybody I'm sorry\""]
["02:22,860","02:31,380","\"This game could be really fucking good just fucking well the thing too. We're talking about HP times four\""]
["02:31,380","02:37,380","\"It's easy. We're talking about it earlier. There's just no strategy to this battle system either\""]
["02:37,380","02:44,820","\"It's literally just using the attack options over the first can be really exciting if you know what you're doing\""]
["02:45,700","02:48,280","\"It can it could be great. I know a lot of people\""]
["02:48,280","02:54,260","\"Have set up and down if they enjoy turn base or they don't but I like it you can do good stuff with it\""]
["02:54,260","02:57,880","\"What are good examples that you know cuz I can say examples, but it's gonna be stupid shit\""]
["02:57,880","03:02,560","\"Like oh, come on can get like so complex and I'm sure you have I mean better examples\""]
["03:02,560","03:08,760","\"What what I like in RPGs is when you can really go all out customizing a party member and coming up with sort of your own\""]
["03:08,760","03:12,580","\"Why we started Digimon because you can customize yeah\""]
["03:12,580","03:13,420","\"- Yeah, you can.\""]
["03:13,420","03:15,500","\"- And Chris is bringing up Final Fantasy VII\""]
["03:15,500","03:16,980","\"while that combat's basic.\""]
["03:16,980","03:19,060","\"What's neat about it is the materia system.\""]
["03:19,060","03:20,540","\"You can kind of do whatever you want\""]
["03:20,540","03:22,860","\"with those party members and get creative, which is neat.\""]
["03:22,860","03:24,660","\"- Oh my God, no!\""]
["03:24,660","03:25,500","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:25,500","03:26,340","\"- What?\""]
["03:26,340","03:27,180","\"- Hey!\""]
["03:27,180","03:28,180","\"(screaming)\""]
["03:28,180","03:29,900","\"- I'm sorry, Chris.\""]
["03:29,900","03:31,380","\"- Are you feeling like Alex right now?\""]
["03:31,380","03:33,220","\"- Is it, does it, are you a MERS?\""]
["03:33,220","03:35,100","\"- What's happening?\""]
["03:35,100","03:37,380","\"- Does it, DingDawg, you've gotten past this.\""]
["03:37,380","03:38,220","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:38,220","03:40,220","\"- Does it lighten up after this cave?\""]
["03:40,220","03:42,420","\"- Uh, kinda, yeah.\""]
["03:42,420","03:45,640","\"You don't get as many battles as this in some of the other areas.\""]
["03:45,640","03:49,460","\"But yeah, I would never say this is like a great game or anything.\""]
["03:49,460","03:50,940","\"It's not at all.\""]
["03:50,940","03:51,940","\"It's so flawed.\""]
["03:51,940","03:54,780","\"I think there's a lot of entertainment that's still be had within it.\""]
["03:54,780","03:55,780","\"I fucking hate you.\""]
["03:55,780","03:56,780","\"I think there's interesting ideas.\""]
["03:56,780","03:57,780","\"Well, geez.\""]
["03:57,780","03:58,780","\"Okay, sorry, Chris.\""]
["03:58,780","04:05,660","\"I already compared it to, I think you made it first, but I brought up your comparison\""]
["04:05,660","04:08,060","\"to, um, to the room.\""]
["04:08,060","04:11,380","\"That was a thing you said very early on when you were like first trying the game and you\""]
["04:11,380","04:13,380","\"I didn't notice all its subtleties yet.\""]
["04:13,380","04:16,580","\"Would you compare it more to something like a Neil Breen film?\""]
["04:16,580","04:19,380","\"I don't know what I would compare it to.\""]
["04:19,380","04:22,480","\"Because even for something that is heavily\""]
["04:22,480","04:26,580","\"that it's incompetent to be trying to deal with all these heady ideals and stuff.\""]
["04:26,580","04:31,380","\"Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Oh my God.\""]
["04:31,380","04:35,580","\"It was very, very overly ambitious for a project considering the team\""]
["04:35,580","04:37,580","\"and what their experience is.\""]
["04:37,580","04:40,580","\"I think he did a good job.\""]
["04:40,980","04:45,140","\"I think ideally in the future what he would want to do is probably be there to at least\""]
["04:45,140","04:50,660","\"like lead art direction maybe, come up with some of the concepts for visuals, but probably\""]
["04:50,660","04:55,540","\"get someone else to work on the programming and get somebody else to handle like the actual\""]
["04:55,540","04:56,540","\"script.\""]
["04:56,540","04:58,940","\"Specifically, the dialogue.\""]
["04:58,940","05:02,580","\"I think the dialogue's really entertaining, but not for the right reason.\""]
["05:02,580","05:05,140","\"I wish there was more of it, if anything.\""]
["05:05,140","05:07,260","\"I mean, there was a lot of it at the beginning.\""]
["05:07,260","05:10,540","\"That's why I also feel like there's probably a lot that happened here to just rush development\""]
["05:10,540","05:14,580","\"along. This part of the game feels like it was done around the end of the game's development\""]
["05:14,580","05:17,340","\"or something because a lot of it's not voice acted.\""]
["05:17,340","05:22,300","\"You said you felt like he did the end in the beginning and then he realized, oh, he's like,\""]
["05:22,300","05:23,580","\"I need to actually fill in the rest.\""]
["05:23,580","05:26,940","\"I don't think he did the end at the beginning. I think he did the beginning at the beginning\""]
["05:26,940","05:31,620","\"because he changed the ending. The ending wasn't planned. It was kind of done last second,\""]
["05:31,620","05:35,460","\"but oh, you have to fall down that hole. I think the hit the switches or something.\""]
["05:35,460","05:36,460","\"That makes sense.\""]
["05:36,460","05:37,460","\"Yeah, there's holes you fall down here.\""]
["05:37,460","05:39,780","\"There's trees in front of that they seem more important\""]
["05:39,780","05:47,980","\"I love that thing is there's a few switches. Yeah. Yeah, see so you might want to\""]
["05:47,980","05:55,420","\"Did something that I wouldn't have gone down that one. Oh, I think you have\""]
["05:55,420","06:02,900","\"To be the center one or on the left you probably want to fall down both holes and hit switches and then come back to this one, right?\""]
["06:04,100","06:07,480","\"Okay, are you allowed to jump off where the spikes are or\""]
["06:07,480","06:12,280","\"From jumping or is it gonna hurt you on platforms each hole?\""]
["06:12,280","06:18,440","\"No, I mean if he walks off the edge of one of those race platforms spike. I don't think it lets you okay\""]
["06:18,440","06:22,640","\"Or it's probably just not gonna do anything. You just bounce off of it or something. I\""]
["06:22,640","06:27,140","\"Don't think he set them up to actually hurt you. I'm pretty sure that's the right spot. Yeah\""]
["06:27,140","06:32,540","\"And then you throw the cat from there. Yeah, oh and then you're gonna go the other one and do it my bad\""]
["06:33,140","06:35,140","\"Great job\""]
["06:35,140","06:36,400","\"Stupid cat\""]
["06:36,400","06:40,620","\"You fucking idiot cat hit the fuck I'm gonna fucking\""]
["06:40,620","06:46,300","\"Want to screech I'm gonna. Why isn't that working that looks like it should be huh?\""]
["06:46,300","06:49,260","\"Mr. Yeegh\""]
["06:49,260","06:51,260","\"What's happening?\""]
["06:51,260","06:57,740","\"There you go, I guess it just has a really tight hitbox really tight puss say\""]
["06:58,820","07:03,580","\"Real-type puss. Oh great little monster. By the way people don't have to agree with this\""]
["07:03,580","07:07,580","\"But I will say it you're allowed to have flexible hitboxes and games\""]
["07:07,580","07:13,020","\"I don't think people complain if you make the hitbox pretty flexible in areas like this\""]
["07:13,020","07:17,660","\"But you know what's annoying having a really tight hitbox and having something not work\""]
["07:17,660","07:20,820","\"And then you get confused and you walk away from the thing you're supposed to do\""]
["07:20,820","07:24,380","\"Be very careful about that\""]
["07:24,380","07:25,300","\"I\""]
["07:25,300","07:27,180","\"Think back to like Donkey Kong country\""]
["07:27,180","07:30,860","\"I think that was the first time I ever noticed it that the hit boxes in that game are very lenient\""]
["07:30,860","07:34,760","\"You have really really tiny hit boxes for where things can actually make contact with you\""]
["07:34,760","07:38,540","\"If you if you like barely scratch something you get to feel like oh, man\""]
["07:38,540","07:43,760","\"You don't get frustrated by that are like oh, it's too easy now. That's usually the reaction you have is like that was really close\""]
["07:43,760","07:48,620","\"I'm just a lot to do that. Yeah, this is ultimate dog shit. What is happening?\""]
["07:48,620","07:50,380","\"Try to center yourself more on the platform.\""]
["07:50,380","07:51,280","\"This is Mr. Caught for me.\""]
["07:51,280","07:52,280","\"This is Mr. Caught for me.\""]
["07:52,280","07:56,700","\"Yeah, you didn't fucking test this part.\""]
["07:56,700","07:57,200","\"There we go.\""]
["07:57,200","08:01,300","\"Now you have to fall down the other hole.\""]
["08:01,300","08:03,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:03,300","08:04,300","\"That's it.\""]
["08:04,300","08:05,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:05,700","08:06,700","\"Oh,\""]
["08:06,700","08:09,600","\"don't everyone see that guy again.\""]
["08:09,600","08:10,900","\"This makes me sad.\""]
["08:10,900","08:12,200","\"I was having fun.\""]
["08:12,200","08:13,100","\"Now I'm having.\""]
["08:13,100","08:14,500","\"Unfun.\""]
["08:14,500","08:16,000","\"I'm having.\""]
["08:16,000","08:16,700","\"None.\""]
["08:16,700","08:18,400","\"Bad time.\""]
["08:18,400","08:19,700","\"What is this one?\""]
["08:19,700","08:20,100","\"Mr.\""]
["08:20,100","08:20,500","\"One.\""]
["08:20,500","08:20,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:20,700","08:21,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:21,700","08:26,500","\"Oh, thank you, Jesus.\""]
["08:26,500","08:30,340","\"The thing with this game too is a lot of people were hoping for it to be doomed anyhow\""]
["08:30,340","08:35,980","\"I know a lot of content creators were really banking on the idea of just riffing this and ripping it to shreds\""]
["08:35,980","08:39,420","\"Yeah, when you take all the cringy parts and then put them all in a big compilation\""]
["08:39,420","08:41,420","\"It's really easy to shit all over it\""]
["08:41,420","08:47,060","\"There are some actual ideas here and like I said some of the visuals are neat. There are some cool things in here\""]
["08:47,060","08:50,940","\"No, it's a mess overall, but it's a really fascinating mess\""]
["08:50,940","08:56,300","\"Just because there are some things that could have worked or there are areas that you look at and you're like\""]
["08:56,300","09:02,580","\"You know what if that was done just slightly different all these things stacked up together you probably could have had a really good moment here\""]
["09:02,580","09:05,460","\"There's good music\""]
["09:05,460","09:07,460","\"Like I said, I like the music here\""]
["09:07,460","09:12,340","\"Because it's the theme song. Yeah, they work it in a lot. It's a really good theme\""]
["09:12,340","09:17,580","\"Yeah, whenever Alex is on screen. They had the really dopey version of it. Yeah, they do with the organs\""]
["09:17,580","09:25,780","\"What is he saying you said my face is screwed up why is he saying such silly things he fucking hates himself?\""]
["09:25,780","09:30,780","\"That's what it's like inside his brain, I guess.\""]
["09:30,780","09:31,780","\"Teach me.\""]
["09:31,780","09:32,780","\"Oh great.\""]
["09:32,780","09:34,780","\"Yeah, I wonder what that does.\""]
["09:34,780","09:37,900","\"That doesn't sound good.\""]
["09:37,900","09:41,540","\"No one should ever sacrifice themselves for Alex Eag.\""]
["09:41,540","09:43,500","\"That's the biggest mistake you could ever make.\""]
["09:43,500","09:44,500","\"But that's the thing too.\""]
["09:44,500","09:49,700","\"When a game is bad, but it's like entertaining for how bad it is, I can always get behind\""]
["09:49,700","09:50,700","\"that too.\""]
["09:50,700","09:52,500","\"It's a thing of yeah, it's disappointing.\""]
["09:52,500","09:55,100","\"It's not going to be something necessarily like fun or high quality.\""]
["09:55,100","09:59,620","\"If there's still like entertainment to be had with it, the writing's funny, something like that.\""]
["09:59,620","10:03,660","\"I don't even think the overall idea of the story is bad. It's just a dialogue.\""]
["10:03,660","10:09,340","\"The thing is, the story is also really disjointed, like what we're doing right now.\""]
["10:09,340","10:15,060","\"There are some very arbitrary portions of the game's plot where it just kind of draws out its length.\""]
["10:15,060","10:16,260","\"And this is one of them.\""]
["10:16,260","10:18,940","\"Like going to like five separate shops.\""]
["10:18,940","10:22,060","\"Hang on, we have to go see Vella before we go.\""]
["10:22,060","10:24,300","\"Okay, she's mad at me and she's not coming.\""]
["10:24,300","10:25,820","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:25,820","10:29,540","\"Poor Vella. Having to put up with this guy.\""]
["10:29,540","10:30,580","\"[gasps]\""]
["10:30,580","10:31,420","\"Level 14.\""]
["10:31,420","10:35,500","\"Chris, how quickly would you snap on Alex?\""]
["10:35,500","10:38,900","\"Very quickly. Like, as quick as Vella did.\""]
["10:38,900","10:39,860","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:39,860","10:42,060","\"She was being patient, if anything.\""]
["10:42,060","10:45,220","\"But then he whips his hair at you and cuts you.\""]
["10:45,220","10:46,700","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:46,700","10:49,620","\"What is a... Oh, okay, weird.\""]
["10:49,620","10:51,300","\"Oh!\""]
["10:52,460","10:57,460","\"Do you want to panda one of these switches after breaking those rocks and then throw the cat to get the treasure?\""]
["10:57,460","10:59,920","\"You might have a point\""]
["10:59,920","11:02,960","\"You'd have to loop around that guitar riff is really funny to me\""]
["11:02,960","11:11,560","\"This is strange isn't it?\""]
["11:11,560","11:15,880","\"No, huh\""]
["11:15,880","11:18,740","\"Weird okay, I have panda on one of them\""]
["11:18,740","11:22,280","\"But then how do you get the last one?\""]
["11:22,280","11:24,280","\"You're gonna have to do it one at a time.\""]
["11:24,280","11:26,280","\"Oh wait, there you go.\""]
["11:26,280","11:30,280","\"You throw the cat to go get the chest.\""]
["11:30,280","11:32,280","\"Oop.\""]
["11:32,280","11:34,280","\"I'm not a fucker.\""]
["11:34,280","11:35,280","\"Don't hit the switch.\""]
["11:35,280","11:36,280","\"I guess it didn't.\""]
["11:36,280","11:37,280","\"That was right.\""]
["11:37,280","11:38,280","\"Oh, well yeah, how does he do that?\""]
["11:38,280","11:39,280","\"I figured that would be the puzzle.\""]
["11:39,280","11:40,280","\"Can you climb up the ladder?\""]
["11:40,280","11:42,280","\"I think I have to do it from this one because it's higher.\""]
["11:42,280","11:44,280","\"Oh, you're right.\""]
["11:44,280","11:45,280","\"Yep, you're right.\""]
["11:45,280","11:46,280","\"There you go.\""]
["11:46,280","11:47,280","\"Didn't read very well.\""]
["11:47,280","11:49,280","\"Yeah, I can't tell that that's a slope.\""]
["11:49,280","11:51,440","\"I mean the game has a lot of problems with that too\""]
["11:51,440","11:57,740","\"Come on Panda time to move so he doesn't really even need the panda. He just needs to stand there, right?\""]
["11:57,740","12:02,760","\"I guess so yeah, you don't need the panda you lied to me mm-hmm deliberately. Oh\""]
["12:02,760","12:05,800","\"Okay\""]
["12:05,800","12:09,820","\"Don't worry. We'll get back together by the third. It's cuz I thought you're gonna need to walk down there\""]
["12:09,820","12:12,340","\"But I didn't realize that was down to go like downhill\""]
["12:12,340","12:15,120","\"Cheeseburger\""]
["12:15,120","12:17,120","\"Thank you. That was great\""]
["12:18,480","12:20,480","\"Just what I needed\""]
["12:20,480","12:28,280","\"But that's why I was wishing to that a lot of these tools you get are more useful than just oh this is the thing you break with this\""]
["12:28,280","12:30,280","\"These are gonna be mimics aren't they?\""]
["12:30,280","12:34,640","\"Probably not with you be I'm gonna be mad\""]
["12:34,640","12:38,840","\"Hey, maybe heal up before you do anything\""]
["12:38,840","12:43,560","\"No, because you could just have Chandra give you cheeseburgers\""]
["12:43,560","12:46,560","\"jeez boogoo\""]
["12:46,600","12:48,600","\"It's what she's known for oh\""]
["12:48,600","12:54,960","\"You probably want to get better equipment - that might help you out in terms of like damage output in battle\""]
["12:54,960","12:59,940","\"I also defense I would assume yeah now which one of ye is the mimic\""]
["12:59,940","13:04,840","\"Where's my where much a burger?\""]
["13:04,840","13:07,160","\"Oh lord\""]
["13:07,160","13:12,220","\"I've seen at least a couple of good videos on yeeke really trying to break it apart and give it some credit\""]
["13:12,220","13:16,400","\"But my friend your Rick did a good one. Yeah that one actually talks about a lot\""]
["13:16,400","13:23,400","\"But when it first came out, it was mostly just people making joke videos out of it and not much else.\""]
["13:23,400","13:27,400","\"I really like his presentation.\""]
["13:27,400","13:31,400","\"He's so good at making stuff look nice here.\""]
["13:31,400","13:35,400","\"Once I'm visiting my house, Tony blocked my toilet really badly with a huge shit.\""]
["13:35,400","13:37,400","\"Then he burned down the house.\""]
["13:37,400","13:39,400","\"I thought you were just going to end it and he blocked me afterwards.\""]
["13:39,400","13:41,400","\"He made a video essay about burning down the house.\""]
["13:41,400","13:44,400","\"He was just a video essay about how rude I was as he stayed in my house.\""]
["13:44,400","13:48,680","\"What the fuck huh? We're talking now\""]
["13:48,680","13:53,360","\"Nope\""]
["13:53,360","13:55,360","\"Take a break what is happening?\""]
["13:55,360","13:59,280","\"What he just said something different than the text\""]
["13:59,280","14:01,740","\"I'm sick of hearing about that whole girl\""]
["14:01,740","14:09,900","\"I've been interested in missing people for a while the idea of people vanishing this\""]
["14:09,900","14:17,220","\"Something that hits close to home, you know, so I started going in chat rooms for people with missing kids and someone on there\""]
["14:17,220","14:19,220","\"Was talked about Sammy Park\""]
["14:19,220","14:24,580","\"What he said Park, but it says it's been most times is what I was bringing up\""]
["14:24,580","14:27,420","\"Well, that's what I was about to say I got cut off earlier\""]
["14:27,420","14:31,540","\"That's not something you can explain by, oh, it's the distortion of realities.\""]
["14:31,540","14:35,700","\"No, you clearly just changed the script and you didn't.\""]
["14:35,700","14:37,220","\"Well, yeah, that's what I think.\""]
["14:37,220","14:41,300","\"I think he was writing lines on the spot and because he had voice actors and the way\""]
["14:41,300","14:44,420","\"that this all got handled, he wasn't going to go back and rerecord lines.\""]
["14:44,420","14:47,100","\"He just ended up switching the name around.\""]
["14:47,100","14:49,220","\"So he keeps going up and down with it.\""]
["14:49,220","14:51,460","\"The text doesn't line up with the voices.\""]
["14:51,460","14:52,940","\"Sometimes she's Sammy Park.\""]
["14:52,940","14:54,460","\"Sometimes she's Sammy Pack.\""]
["14:54,460","14:56,420","\"Sometimes she's Sammy Pack.\""]
["14:57,100","14:59,020","\"Sometimes she's the rumble pack.\""]
["14:59,020","15:00,540","\"It gets very confusing.\""]
["15:00,540","15:01,740","\"- I like the transfer pack.\""]
["15:01,740","15:02,700","\"(punching)\""]
["15:02,700","15:03,900","\"- That one's good too.\""]
