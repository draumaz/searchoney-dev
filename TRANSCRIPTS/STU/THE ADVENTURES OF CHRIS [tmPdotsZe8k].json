["00:20,880","00:25,480","\"I was also not expecting to see Africa and like Saudi Arabia and the Indian peninsula there.\""]
["00:25,480","00:27,960","\"This is as big of an adventure as you could possibly get.\""]
["00:27,960","00:31,320","\"What I heard of the Adventures of Chris, I thought it would be like a fictional world.\""]
["00:31,320","00:32,640","\"It's like that's the planet Earth.\""]
["00:32,640","00:38,300","\"So you're telling me though that Saudi Arabia is in a cold war with Iran in the world of\""]
["00:38,300","00:41,260","\"the Adventures of Chris, because those continents still exist in this world.\""]
["00:41,260","00:45,060","\"Yeah, all those little yellow dots, symbolize war events happening right now.\""]
["00:45,060","00:47,780","\"That's nuclear bombs being detonated over the planet.\""]
