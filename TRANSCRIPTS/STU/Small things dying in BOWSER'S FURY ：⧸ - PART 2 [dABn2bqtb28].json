["01:23,820","01:26,620","\"Okay, never mind\""]
["01:26,620","01:30,980","\"One time when I was when I was a kid my dad\""]
["01:30,980","01:34,200","\"He had like like a little like when I say a boat\""]
["01:34,200","01:38,380","\"Picture like something half the size of what you're probably thinking\""]
["01:38,380","01:43,860","\"but he had like a little like a little like boat little boatlet and\""]
["01:43,860","01:52,140","\"It didn't stop working and he was like around in the engine because we're just like out in the open water like just stuck and\""]

["01:59,660","02:03,980","\"So he just like he just like angled it out and like revved the boat and it\""]
["02:03,980","02:06,580","\"launched the thing like a thousand feet\""]
["02:06,580","02:10,320","\"Remember it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen in my whole life\""]
["02:10,320","02:13,860","\"How come every story you tell us about something small dying?\""]
["02:13,860","02:20,640","\"I don't know man. It's half the stories of life are about small things dying. I guess you're right\""]
["02:20,640","02:22,660","\"I told you at the time I saw a page you get run over right\""]
["02:23,260","02:26,840","\"No, it's really sad. It was just look I was waiting for a taxi and a pinch\""]
["02:26,840","02:31,680","\"It was walking across the road and then a car drove by it like one mile an hour and slowly ran it over\""]
["02:31,680","02:37,100","\"Just breaking every bone in his body as I watched. That's horrible. I know I hate it. See why would you tell that story?\""]
["02:37,100","02:40,720","\"That's not a funny story of a funny little thing that's fucking life\""]
["02:40,720","02:47,180","\"Sometimes the little thing dies when you fuck actually I don't know what that fish died. It could have lived frickin\""]
["02:47,180","02:51,780","\"Yeah, you're probably right, but dude that was a that was a bad day. I'm sorry\""]
["02:52,020","02:54,020","\"You had to see that\""]
["02:54,020","02:56,700","\"It's kind of funny the weird way I\""]
["02:56,700","03:01,040","\"Saw a truck hit like a seagull and it like exploded like a fucking cartoon\""]
["03:01,040","03:06,600","\"Feathers flew everywhere. Are you hitting that tumor and oh, why did you see a seagull explode?\""]
["03:06,600","03:11,140","\"I don't know. Oops. What do you mean? Why hey? We kept my eyes on the road like a good driver\""]
["03:11,140","03:14,460","\"against that's fair\""]
["03:14,460","03:16,180","\"but uh\""]
["03:16,180","03:17,860","\"Yeah\""]
["03:17,860","03:24,840","\"There's like a video of like a like a baseball game where the guy like throws a pitch and a bird like flies right in front of it\""]
["03:24,840","03:26,840","\"That I've seen that's classic\""]
["03:26,840","03:34,320","\"Birds are stupid. You don't even really see the bird you just see all the feathers exploding so you just know what happened\""]
["03:34,320","03:39,440","\"Yeah, exactly that that was what it was like when the truck hit hit the bird and basically just did that\""]
["03:39,440","03:46,920","\"And there he is that's always covered in viscous chemicals. Yeah, just straight and long dude\""]
["03:47,160","03:49,880","\"This is petroleum. Oh look at this\""]
["03:49,880","03:56,900","\"You know what problem video games haven't solved yet pollution no high res to model pop in\""]
["03:56,900","04:03,980","\"Yeah, cuz there's no way to actually solve it you can have a high res texture fade in on top of a low res one\""]
["04:03,980","04:09,800","\"But then you're computing both of them at once anyway. Hmm. Isn't that stinky? Yeah, okay?\""]
["04:09,800","04:11,760","\"What I just do\""]
["04:11,760","04:15,560","\"Did these fucking seagulls have caddiers everything is a cat what?\""]

["04:33,000","04:37,060","\"I already took all the coins you took them okay. Yeah fucking whatever\""]
["04:37,060","04:44,140","\"Let's get the fuck out of here. Oh, you sure nothing was gonna trigger from him going up there. No, why would I be sure that I?\""]
["04:44,920","04:50,760","\"Feel like we should go up there cuz it's literally face. It's the one spot that's pointed like right of bows or I don't\""]
["04:50,760","04:57,120","\"coincidence I thought it yeah, I thought it was just a little side zone, but you know what you're you're probably right\""]
["04:57,120","05:01,560","\"There might be something also you could probably climb. Oh no. No, he's gonna get\""]
["05:01,560","05:07,280","\"Holy shit, I got something out there. Thank you murdered. All right now. Just climb up that. Oh, yeah\""]
["05:07,280","05:09,120","\"Now you can just climb it get the scamper. Oh\""]
["05:10,480","05:17,040","\"Well, maybe it was like an Assassin's Creed like vantage point. Yeah, why you can fast travel back here?\""]
["05:17,040","05:19,040","\"Is it supposed to be doing that?\""]
["05:19,040","05:25,060","\"You might have you might have summoned him. I love the way his tips are really hot. Yeah, okay\""]
["05:25,060","05:28,960","\"He's got his little Guy Fieri frosted tips his hot frosted tips\""]
["05:28,960","05:35,760","\"Yeah, did you know if you lose a frosted tip and you put it under your pillow at night the the tooth theory comes and choose\""]
["05:35,760","05:37,760","\"on your scalp the\""]
["05:39,040","05:43,520","\"Classic did you come up with that all in here? Oh, yeah, I like that. Thanks man\""]
["05:43,520","05:48,440","\"I don't know anything about Guy Furia, and I always expect he's like a Tommy Wise always kind of character\""]
["05:48,440","05:54,000","\"I know I wouldn't compare with Tommy Wise though. That's that's the like all I've seen his pictures of him\""]
["05:54,000","05:57,240","\"So that's the wrong kind of impression. I have in my head of him right now\""]
["05:57,240","06:00,320","\"Yeah, I don't really know a lot about him either to be fair\""]
["06:00,320","06:04,860","\"I just know that whoa I just know that like he looks like a douche\""]
["06:04,860","06:08,420","\"But apparently he just does really nice things all the time really yeah\""]
["06:08,420","06:13,420","\"He's like a food channel guy I think and he like he's the he's the\""]
["06:13,420","06:20,460","\"Diners dryness and dives guy right yeah, and he like goes to the third world countries and gives them his leftovers\""]
["06:20,460","06:27,620","\"I freaking love how he looks in this party on another cool boat bowser fight. I don't think it's a fight\""]
["06:27,620","06:29,560","\"I think he's just messing with you. What's his\""]
["06:29,560","06:36,880","\"He's giving us platforms to jump on I think we should oblige or just crawl straight up that tower since your cat\""]
["06:36,940","06:44,340","\"Yeah, you can do anything you dang one if you're a cat. That's a cool little effect. Whoa everybody wants to be a cat\""]
["06:44,340","06:47,620","\"Because being a cat no\""]
["06:47,620","06:52,380","\"You're in space, okay, I guess we can get you here\""]
["06:52,380","06:56,380","\"This is the perfect path to like drop stuff on Bowser's head\""]
["06:56,380","07:01,300","\"Yeah, you could get a penny like the Empire State Building and just split a scallop\""]
["07:01,300","07:04,260","\"This is ridiculous\""]
["07:06,100","07:08,820","\"This is bedonculus come on yeah\""]

["07:18,840","07:29,340","\"Man, I thought it was gonna lay in on Bowser's head, but he's just gone now\""]
["07:29,340","07:34,860","\"Leave because you pissed him off. That's sad. I wanted to have a big fun thing with him\""]
["07:34,860","07:39,780","\"You will it looks like every time you ring a bell you get to punch him in the jaw\""]
["07:39,780","07:43,720","\"So does that look more like a crock character than a Mario character? Yeah, it actually does\""]
["07:43,720","07:50,080","\"The fuck this is the crock Mario game. They should have had a crossover a crock over\""]
["07:50,080","07:55,140","\"Smash I saw what is this about? What is this?\""]

["08:00,540","08:02,020","\"- Bubsy did not fucking come back.\""]
["08:02,020","08:04,300","\"They put in the most minimal amount of effort possible\""]
["08:04,300","08:05,740","\"to keep the IP or some shit.\""]
["08:05,740","08:06,740","\"- Bubsy came back.\""]
["08:06,740","08:08,620","\"- Bubs, that's the story of Bubsy 3D.\""]
["08:08,620","08:12,060","\"- No, no, Bubsy 3D was still considered an official Bubsy game,\""]
["08:12,060","08:14,540","\"but the one that just came out like a few years ago\""]
["08:14,540","08:16,300","\"was fucking utter horseshit.\""]
["08:16,300","08:19,500","\"It was like a mobile phone platform, it was terrible.\""]
["08:19,500","08:21,820","\"- Yeah, I know, I edited the episode.\""]

["10:17,680","10:22,360","\"Bowser Junior is not good enough to collect the cat shines. Yeah, he's a dumbass\""]
["10:22,360","10:28,940","\"Why does he prefer that Bowser Junior all over all the other ones? Probably because it came out looking like him. Oh look\""]

["10:39,100","10:46,320","\"But there was definitely at least one more yeah, there's another red thing and then if you go to I bet if you go to this\""]
["10:46,320","10:50,660","\"Thing that seems to be directing Kat Mario to it go to look at Mario\""]

["11:33,460","11:40,600","\"I know but it was funnier this way. That's a good point. We need to get up you fat fucking plumber. There you go. There's only one left\""]
["11:40,600","11:49,980","\"Zoom in zoom out. I don't like that. Okay, it puts it into 4k. Where's the damn last one?\""]

["12:19,040","12:23,200","\"But it might have been that one that Tomar grabbed earlier. I really can't say I\""]
