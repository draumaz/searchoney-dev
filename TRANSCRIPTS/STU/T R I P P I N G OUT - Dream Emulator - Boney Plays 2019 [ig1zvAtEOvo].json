["11:29,580","11:33,060","\"Concentrated environment and I didn't understand what I was doing\""]

["11:50,020","11:57,020","\"So because you went to the port purple spike everything was like really dark and fucking creepy. So you this place comes up a lot\""]
["11:57,420","12:04,400","\"Yeah, it's kind of a shit hole. I think like you kind of are looking for like special objects to interact with to like get to your true objective\""]
["12:04,400","12:10,180","\"Oh, yeah, so look for bright things not dark for something like yeah, like that stands out\""]
["12:10,180","12:14,080","\"Okay, so the red pill sign was pretty yes, that was effective\""]
["12:14,080","12:18,900","\"I was over here caught your attention see that's what you need to do because that's what you do when you have an LSD\""]
["12:18,900","12:21,680","\"Or when you're a good core here follow the colors\""]
