["00:14,200","00:18,800","\"This was classified under \"\"platformers\"\".\""]

["00:29,800","00:35,640","\"No, no, this is broken. Wait, just refresh it. See what do you expect from this from a game called troll face, bro? I\""]
["00:35,640","00:43,840","\"Listen to me. You're right. I expect a game that doesn't sound right. All right, dr. Cox in his obituary locks\""]
["00:43,840","00:48,900","\"Our dr. Cox in his arbitrary locks is also a browser game. Oh should we give this one a shot?\""]

["00:58,080","01:05,440","\"Why not just do Waz controls? It's annoying. I prefer this for Dr. Cox and his beautiful\""]

["01:12,520","01:17,400","\"Is that switch on the left one of his his arbitrary locks? I think you might have to\""]
["01:17,400","01:24,480","\"get on that platform. Does he and X being left in race? So is arbitrary? Is that the\""]
["01:24,480","01:29,360","\"point is that everything's arbitrary about this game. It's very avant-garde, isn't it?\""]
