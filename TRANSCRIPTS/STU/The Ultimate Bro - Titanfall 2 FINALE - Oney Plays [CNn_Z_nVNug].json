["06:38,100","06:41,620","\"That's a good question. I don't think I've ever seen Mario with his shoes off\""]
["06:41,620","06:47,500","\"I see Sonic with his shoes off. Yeah, they made a point of it in the Sonic movie to have Jim Carrey digitally\""]
["06:47,500","06:51,860","\"Reconstructs Sonic's foot in 3D. Then they have six toes apparently\""]
["06:51,860","06:59,020","\"That's Duzzi. So someone said there was the fart joke and there was that so they're definitely poking fun at fetish it, right?\""]

["07:05,300","07:09,800","\"But in my eyes, it's the Hollywood producers are like we need to make children fucked up little monsters\""]

["08:41,680","08:43,520","\"Well, that was never a big story\""]
["08:43,520","08:46,160","\"The never big story one is this magical movie to me and I love it\""]
["08:46,160","08:50,320","\"Listen Chris as much as you hate never any story you never replaced the first one\""]
["08:50,320","08:52,560","\"It's okay to like it. No, I love the first one\""]
["08:52,560","08:58,200","\"But uh that's what I hate about that scene stranger things is that they just sing it for literally no reason\""]
["08:58,200","09:00,720","\"Just just to say you know we it was in the 80s\""]
["09:00,720","09:01,880","\"So we have to put it in there\""]
["09:01,880","09:07,520","\"I hate it when you can tell have someone wrote a scene like like it's the same shit in zombie land\""]
["09:07,520","09:10,760","\"We're it's like Bill Murray walks in he's like you're my mansion Bill Murray\""]
["09:10,760","09:17,480","\"All it really boils down to is like the people wanted to meet Bill Murray so they shoehorn him into the movie that's kind of what\""]
["09:18,560","09:23,320","\"Counter reefs has become yeah, that's true the shoe in the producers want to meet the piano reef\""]
["09:23,320","09:25,640","\"So they shove him into the sponge by movie they shove him in the water\""]
["09:25,640","09:31,440","\"Anything anybody like everyone's piano Reeves best friend and don't get me wrong seems like a nice guy\""]
