["01:32,280","01:35,440","\"Scottish I think\""]
["01:35,440","01:41,440","\"But up until like the mid-1800s nobody even celebrated Halloween in the US\""]
["01:41,440","01:48,960","\"But like by 1915 everybody is celebrating it because of the huge influx of fucking Irish in the show an Irish on screen\""]

["02:53,600","03:00,580","\"I actually don't think so now I think it's a bunch of pre-built rooms that are randomly picked that are picked and then certain rooms\""]
["03:00,580","03:06,200","\"Like depending on where you're at I think are designed to be there. I I think that's how it works\""]
