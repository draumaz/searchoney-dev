["00:08,600","00:09,600","\"That dinosaur?\""]
["00:09,600","00:11,100","\"It's Civilizing.\""]

["00:13,000","00:17,300","\"No, no, okay. What is the story? This is supposed to be Star Fox Adventures.\""]
["00:17,300","00:21,500","\"Or no, this is... This is... Star Fox Adventures was supposed to be this.\""]
["00:21,500","00:24,800","\"Yeah, and then they came in and were like, \"\"Put our guy in it.\"\"\""]
["00:24,800","00:25,800","\"*Laughs*\""]
["00:26,700","00:31,980","\"Miyamoto said, \"\"I always wrote 'fuck' says me, put me in the game.\"\"\""]
["00:31,980","00:33,820","\"You can only have a five-letter name.\""]
["00:33,820","00:35,260","\"Evil, fiable.\""]
["00:35,260","00:36,940","\"That's a good caveman name.\""]
["00:36,940","00:39,340","\"Faber, me, fieber.\""]
["00:39,340","00:43,020","\"It works on irony levels too, because he's mighty.\""]
["00:43,020","00:45,980","\"We haven't even tested on this game yet.\""]
["00:45,980","00:47,340","\"Oh yeah, this might go horribly.\""]
["00:47,340","00:47,820","\"Wow.\""]
["00:47,820","00:49,100","\"This could be a whole mess.\""]
["00:49,100","00:51,980","\"I've seen this. I've seen this in the other game.\""]
["00:51,980","00:56,220","\"Yeah, but they gave this character a big booty and big titties.\""]
["00:56,220","00:58,220","\"She's going\""]
["00:58,220","01:00,860","\"This is a different character rose\""]
["01:00,860","01:07,460","\"This one doesn't leave a snail trail. They haven't made her fuckable yet. This one leaves a trail of bodies\""]
["01:07,460","01:21,380","\"I would have loved this as a kid already because of the dinosaur screaming and the little and that creature that we're dr. Seuss movie thing\""]
["01:22,340","01:26,980","\"Do you think a lot of furries work to rare where you like even back in the day?\""]
["01:26,980","01:32,020","\"I always wonder if that's like a chicken or the egg kind of situation, right?\""]
["01:32,020","01:38,860","\"Whoa like I wonder I wonder if furries are the creation of things like this or if they've been among us\""]
["01:38,860","01:42,360","\"I don't know according to Frederick mudsons\""]
["01:42,360","01:51,480","\"I've never learned how to say his last name, right? But the down the rabbit hole guy. I think I think furry stuff\""]
["01:52,020","01:56,660","\"Like really has its genesis in like the 60s or 70s. Well like Looney Tunes\""]
["01:56,660","01:59,780","\"No like post Looney Tunes, but\""]
["01:59,780","02:08,540","\"But because of Looney Tunes, but probably a little driven by cross-dressing bugs, but yeah, this controls really badly that stinks oh\""]
["02:08,540","02:16,900","\"Sucks for you, buddy. Yeah, this game is not finished by the way. That makes sense. This was a Nintendo 64 game\""]
["02:16,900","02:21,600","\"It became Star Fox Adventure which was the game cube\""]
["02:21,600","02:27,220","\"Which was a game nobody really liked because there was a dinosaur and if he didn't feed him mushrooms, he died.\""]
["02:27,220","02:29,540","\"Oh my god this is-\""]
["02:29,540","02:30,280","\"Ugh!\""]
["02:30,280","02:33,360","\"Does it sort of control like a star fox?\""]
["02:33,360","02:35,620","\"No! It's horrible! Look at this shit!\""]
["02:35,620","02:38,100","\"Well this is- this was never supposed to be star fox.\""]
["02:38,100","02:41,900","\"No, I mean that is a fair point, but just in terms of the- the format,\""]
["02:41,900","02:45,260","\"I thought maybe it would be comparable to star fox.\""]
["02:45,260","02:46,860","\"Yeah, it's a lot of wishful thinking.\""]
["02:46,860","02:49,080","\"Whoa, look at that.\""]
["02:49,080","02:53,640","\"So you said Tomar that you found this in a garage sale with a black cartridge.\""]
["02:53,640","02:55,040","\"Yeah, I said that.\""]
["02:55,040","02:56,440","\"You said that, yeah.\""]
["02:56,440","02:59,040","\"No!\""]
["02:59,040","03:00,800","\"The Tomar cartridge.\""]
["03:00,800","03:03,480","\"Oh, how the mighty dinos have fallen.\""]
["03:03,480","03:06,040","\"Is it supposed to be running at one frame a second?\""]
["03:06,040","03:06,680","\"Yes.\""]
["03:06,680","03:07,680","\"OK.\""]
["03:07,680","03:10,720","\"Oh, she's so weird looking.\""]
["03:10,720","03:15,320","\"It's an appealing character design for everyone.\""]
["03:18,320","03:23,200","\"She kind of looks like blinks the time sweeper like an early except frozen a little bit. Yeah\""]
["03:23,200","03:29,880","\"Get out of here guys had this in his garage since December 2000\""]
["03:29,880","03:37,240","\"Just being like I'm the only guy who who gets to play this game besides the original rare employees\""]
["03:37,240","03:43,060","\"So wait, how did how did this actually appear like did some guy like come out of a jack-in-the-box holding it?\""]
["03:43,400","03:48,040","\"Supposedly yes some private collector recently just like gave it like\""]
["03:48,040","03:56,000","\"Someone tracked it down and they were able to convince him to let them take a dump of of this like dev cartridge that he had or\""]
["03:56,000","03:58,200","\"whatever\""]
["03:58,200","04:04,360","\"Is this really supposed to be cannot be possible that runs this badly it wasn't finished\""]
["04:04,360","04:11,320","\"Really it was never yeah, this isn't a finish. Yeah, what if it does run better than this and we're just stupid\""]
["04:12,120","04:19,040","\"Then that would suck it's possible. I've heard that this runs a lot better if you have a real flash car that you can put it in\""]
["04:19,040","04:22,120","\"N64 compared to emulating it. Wow, okay\""]
["04:22,120","04:28,440","\"But I can't say how much better you just want to drop that bomb on us hot on our I\""]
["04:28,440","04:33,860","\"Mean maybe this should be an incentive for us to go and buy a cool N64 flash car\""]
["04:33,860","04:37,520","\"That would be pretty rad. I would do a kickflip if we did that\""]
["04:37,520","04:40,400","\"We could recharge our energy\""]
["04:40,400","04:42,400","\"With that special egg\""]
["04:42,400","04:47,040","\"She definitely looked a lot sexier back in the good old days your pop is special egg\""]
["04:47,040","04:51,680","\"You saying you think this is sexier than the the GameCube? No, I'm saying she looks less sexualized\""]
["04:51,680","04:55,560","\"She looks more kind of just like oh, I'm normal. I'm just the cat\""]
["04:55,560","05:01,300","\"Dinosaur world. Oh, it's general scales. I remember that\""]
["05:03,040","05:11,500","\"You look cool. Oh he's still general scales. Yeah, I remember there was a\""]
["05:11,500","05:16,660","\"John Tron video where he comes out he's like \"\"Gugalagugal general scales, my last\""]
["05:16,660","05:25,720","\"bruv gala\"\" \"\"I smeew on me pikkukkuk sashkudoknakevuk\"\" \"\"A long way from home, crystal. I can't believe the wizard\""]
["05:25,720","05:28,320","\"I said girl, I'm gonna do a dirty work.\""]
["05:28,320","05:30,280","\"[Laughing]\""]
["05:30,280","05:37,280","\"Now you have to wipe my bum bum! Who is this dirty guy? Who is this dirty guy? He has to be the programmer.\""]
["05:37,280","05:44,320","\"Let's just see. They would just cast people around the office. That was like a common thing. I think that's awesome. They should continue to do that.\""]
["05:44,320","05:55,560","\"He's may have just been placeholder voices too. You know, I think that you joke. You joke. I don't joke! I'm serious! You just and you joke. But that is actually what they did for that little bit.\""]
["05:55,560","05:58,600","\"like Hellblade Senuous Sacrifice game.\""]
["05:58,600","05:59,100","\"Oh.\""]
["05:59,100","06:01,160","\"It was very performance driven.\""]
["06:01,160","06:05,680","\"I know, no, I know they do that a lot and I prefer when they do that because either the\""]
["06:05,680","06:09,440","\"voices turn and turn out good or they turn out so bad it's good.\""]
["06:09,440","06:10,440","\"That's a good point.\""]
["06:10,440","06:14,400","\"Is the princess that little like ducky in a cage?\""]
["06:14,400","06:16,520","\"I don't know.\""]
["06:16,520","06:17,520","\"Does look like ducky.\""]
["06:17,520","06:18,520","\"I'm not imagining that.\""]
["06:18,520","06:20,840","\"No, you're right.\""]
["06:20,840","06:24,960","\"I don't know if he was insinuating that was the princess or if there was a princess at\""]
["06:24,960","06:25,960","\"a later date.\""]
["06:25,960","06:27,960","\"The princess is in a later date.\""]
["06:27,960","06:30,960","\"I wish they said that.\""]
["06:30,960","06:32,960","\"Sorry Mario, the princess is at a later date.\""]
["06:32,960","06:38,520","\"How come these old shit games had actual good atmosphere somehow even though they look\""]
["06:38,520","06:39,520","\"like this?\""]
["06:39,520","06:43,160","\"Uh, I don't know, maybe they just had to pick the colors smarter?\""]
["06:43,160","06:45,480","\"I don't know.\""]
["06:45,480","06:51,160","\"I feel like people out, people capable of working under more restrictive formats, tend\""]
["06:51,160","06:53,160","\"to just be better at their jobs.\""]
["06:53,160","06:54,160","\"I guess you're right.\""]
["06:54,160","06:57,860","\"I'm not saying that it that is what brings out the best.\""]
["06:57,860","07:02,380","\"Just it's a good like litmus test for quality.\""]
["07:02,380","07:04,100","\"You found a guy who couldn't work in this.\""]
["07:04,100","07:06,880","\"You'd pick him out a lot faster and fire him.\""]
["07:06,880","07:09,340","\"- I bet there was some dude that made some sick\""]
["07:09,340","07:12,100","\"gray cave textures back in the day though.\""]
["07:12,100","07:15,060","\"- Why did they incorporate a fucking real dinosaur\""]
["07:15,060","07:16,540","\"into the head of the ship like that?\""]
["07:16,540","07:18,340","\"- So it can see obviously.\""]
["07:18,340","07:20,020","\"- It's kind of, it is kind of more fun\""]
["07:20,020","07:22,260","\"than it just being a regular ship.\""]
["07:22,260","07:25,380","\"I mean, but how do you think it feels?\""]
["07:25,380","07:28,860","\"Probably a lot of pain right now, as I'm saying.\""]
["07:28,860","07:30,300","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:30,300","07:33,260","\"- Like just being left to burn and scream in silence.\""]

["08:17,760","08:23,640","\"Is that even in the first game? Yeah, it's the shit area that no one likes to love a lot of love a place\""]
["08:23,640","08:26,520","\"Oh with that things ass everywhere. Hey, yeah\""]
["08:26,520","08:30,280","\"Aw\""]

["08:39,000","08:45,520","\"She seems really bothered by the fact that she has to try this\""]

["08:50,780","09:06,360","\"Wow, I'm in a witch realm she immediately just gives up on the idea of getting out of that cage\""]
["09:06,360","09:10,020","\"apparently that would be something where it was like\""]
["09:11,280","09:15,960","\"Okay, if you didn't have captors that would catch you doing it, right?\""]
["09:15,960","09:21,060","\"Like if you were in a little cage like that if this whole fucking adventure is to open that cage\""]
["09:21,060","09:29,960","\"You think your better use of your time would just be to brute force it and like yeah some of the bars\""]
["09:29,960","09:38,140","\"It would take a while, but you could do it look at all this yeah, it would certainly expose you to less danger than this adventure\""]
["09:39,080","09:41,080","\"What the hell is going on here?\""]
["09:41,080","09:44,240","\"But that that that surely must be only\""]
["09:44,240","09:53,800","\"It's not just interested in saving princesses. She wants true adventure. Yeah, she wants so much more\""]
["09:53,800","10:00,600","\"Which is kind of unfortunate for this princess that she's abandoning right now kill that it looks different from you\""]
["10:00,600","10:04,240","\"Oh, there's weird shadow shit going on here. What are you? Are you good?\""]
["10:04,240","10:07,160","\"That cannot be\""]

["10:08,760","10:10,960","\"I'm not gonna judge. It might be a nice guy.\""]
["10:10,960","10:12,900","\"You didn't even try hitting it with your stick.\""]
["10:12,900","10:14,520","\"Oh no.\""]
["10:14,520","10:15,440","\"Okay, I'll try.\""]
["10:15,440","10:17,280","\"What if it drops something good?\""]

["10:21,760","10:23,800","\"Even with a talking like that.\""]
["10:23,800","10:25,560","\"I don't know. It's scary.\""]
["10:25,560","10:26,600","\"But like, isn't this crazy?\""]
["10:26,600","10:29,780","\"Like it does have like genuine atmosphere.\""]
["10:29,780","10:30,620","\"Kinda, yeah.\""]
["10:30,620","10:31,940","\"My god.\""]

["10:33,160","10:34,840","\"With this pal, dino.\""]
["10:35,760","10:39,640","\"with the Z-lock icon, it means it can be interacted with.\""]
["10:39,640","10:42,800","\"This is like Z-targeting, ZZ-target.\""]
["10:42,800","10:46,000","\"Yeah, you could tell that this game was heavily inspired\""]
["10:46,000","10:51,000","\"by Zova, or at least the Star Fox game seemed like it was.\""]
["10:51,000","10:55,800","\"But that probably oversells how good it is.\""]
["10:55,800","10:58,680","\"If someone gave you $78 to live in this realm,\""]
["10:58,680","10:59,880","\"would you do it?\""]

["24:41,020","24:47,100","\"He kind of talks like Fox - oh\""]

["24:53,620","25:02,060","\"So they still said saber in the crystal parts. Yeah, this was clearly in like a transitional phase of the movie. That's that's kind of cool\""]
