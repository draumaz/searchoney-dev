["00:17,100","00:18,360","\"-Okay, explain. -Explain?\""]

["00:32,240","00:36,420","\"Way too scary. We're gonna push this into October\""]

["00:54,920","01:00,220","\"You just can't be doing stuff like that. So we're coming off of right off of Shadow the Hedgehog\""]
["01:00,220","01:03,100","\"You're literally seeing us in the future which you would be I got a double spare\""]
["01:03,100","01:09,900","\"I always say to the past so yeah, we just we just got off like Shadow the Hedgehog and Corey loved it so much\""]
["01:09,900","01:14,360","\"You're pretty fast\""]
["01:14,360","01:16,360","\"Yeah in this game you go really quickly\""]
["01:16,360","01:23,300","\"Whoa, I know it's not a one-to-one of the original classics, but it's still way better than what forces fucking attempted\""]
["01:23,300","01:27,740","\"Why didn't they just make a full game of this huh? They did it's called Sonic Generations\""]
["01:27,740","01:31,180","\"But what I mean after that when they take this engine and just make a new name\""]
["01:31,180","01:36,540","\"It's called Sonic 4 I think that's what the okay. This is what Sonic Frontier's is gonna be no, it's not\""]
["01:36,540","01:41,160","\"I mean without classic Sonic, but the modern stages look a lot like it\""]
["01:41,160","01:46,040","\"Have you seen them? No? Yeah, they look pretty similar maybe\""]
["01:46,040","01:50,620","\"Hating on that game I've literally I've not seen that much of it, but I'm okay\""]
["01:50,620","01:55,120","\"I can go I can go in my spiel of ice please because I actually I'm an ignoramus. No, it's fine\""]
["01:55,120","01:57,540","\"It's fine like me. I don't know any about Sonic frontiers\""]
["01:57,540","02:04,740","\"The thing about Sonic's frontiers is it had one of the worst marketing campaigns ever its first reveal trailer\""]
["02:04,740","02:09,780","\"Was like the worst quality and it was like the person playing had no idea\""]
["02:09,780","02:16,680","\"Empty nothing no no like it was also an early build like they were showing early everything\""]
["02:16,680","02:22,020","\"Is it that scary that they're releasing footage that's early? Yeah, I mean to me that was really bad\""]
["02:22,020","02:28,000","\"That's just read is like honest. No, it wasn't it wasn't honest because the thing about frontiers\""]
["02:28,000","02:32,120","\"They lied to make it look worse. No, no, you're you're being antagonistic\""]
["02:32,120","02:41,440","\"Frontiers there's two different types of play styles their speed and like platform control the dipshit that was playing was just walking around\""]
["02:41,440","02:45,780","\"Because nobody probably told him that he needed to speed so he was just meandering around\""]
["02:45,780","02:51,360","\"Instead of like speeding around like anyone who plays a sonic game would do because if you look at future\""]
["02:51,360","02:59,920","\"Like gameplay examples. It shows like you know real parkourian stuff and real sense of movement instead of just like me angering back and right\""]
["02:59,920","03:04,280","\"But the thing about first years that I want to talk about compared to like so fucking loud\""]
["03:04,280","03:09,360","\"I'm just gonna delegate. Yeah, like just as we turn down to like there\""]
["03:10,640","03:12,640","\"Yeah, yeah, that's good. That's so much better.\""]
["03:12,640","03:15,960","\"I'll go on to frontiers about this. It's me and my friend's birthday, so\""]
["03:15,960","03:21,800","\"Been there done that. It was your birthday yesterday. You didn't fucking tell me. I'm sorry\""]
["03:21,800","03:26,120","\"I was sick and I forgot I would have held the bucket for you\""]
["03:26,120","03:31,900","\"I literally forgot that it was my birthday until it was one day a year. I would have done it. I opened my pocket before he pooped it\""]
["03:31,900","03:38,240","\"I forgot it was my birthday until I opened Twitter and saw balloons popping up and I'm like, oh shit. Yeah, it's my birthday\""]
["03:38,960","03:43,880","\"Even Rouge came to his birthday. That's nice of her. Yeah, I thought she didn't give a shit about nobody\""]
["03:43,880","03:45,960","\"Well Sonic became friends with a\""]
["03:45,960","03:51,220","\"You get jealous by using his try that Rouge was like do you have any real shit? She was a message me\""]
["03:51,220","03:58,520","\"You guys get jealous I told you she was no way that's how I believe you said\""]
["03:58,520","04:02,580","\"I want proof and I don't want proof that she sent you a trial version of her fucking\""]
["04:02,580","04:06,880","\"She did she didn't tell me to subscribe to her only fan. She was actually interested in me for me\""]

["04:41,640","04:44,660","\"No, it's yeah, I got a hallway size hot\""]
["04:44,660","04:49,580","\"That just means it's gonna stay a bit more places. It's she's built for me\""]

["05:02,040","05:04,640","\"You just stand and get the law, it's pretty fucking soda.\""]
["05:04,640","05:06,520","\"- It's pretty soda. - Yeah.\""]
["05:06,520","05:07,360","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:07,360","05:09,560","\"- The bed went too far, okay, there we go.\""]
["05:09,560","05:11,800","\"- Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, but get it all.\""]
["05:11,800","05:12,800","\"It slid in.\""]
["05:12,800","05:14,360","\"- So that's the story, basically.\""]
["05:14,360","05:15,880","\"We just go to each level and like,\""]
["05:15,880","05:18,040","\"- Color it in really fast? - Yeah.\""]
["05:18,040","05:20,200","\"So I wanna talk about Sonic Frontiers.\""]
["05:20,200","05:21,560","\"So the thing about Sonic Frontiers,\""]
["05:21,560","05:23,720","\"like people are complaining about like,\""]
["05:23,720","05:25,880","\"this is really disturbing. - The world of the blue.\""]
["05:25,880","05:27,720","\"- The core, before you say, I just wanted to,\""]
["05:27,720","05:29,920","\"is the consensus now that it was like,\""]
["05:29,920","05:30,760","\"(crowd cheering)\""]
["05:30,760","05:32,320","\"is the now consensus,\""]
["05:32,320","05:33,320","\"'cause you know, I don't really,\""]
["05:33,320","05:34,360","\"it's just interesting to know,\""]
["05:34,360","05:35,640","\"'cause I haven't really checked.\""]
["05:35,640","05:37,240","\"But are people now saying what you're saying\""]
["05:37,240","05:38,920","\"or are you kind of defending it against people\""]
["05:38,920","05:40,880","\"that largely don't like it?\""]
["05:40,880","05:42,640","\"- What does the internet think of it?\""]
["05:42,640","05:44,680","\"- The internet is totally mixed.\""]
["05:44,680","05:46,920","\"Here's what I personally think Frontier's gonna do.\""]
["05:46,920","05:49,400","\"I think Frontier's is gonna do great with critics\""]
["05:49,400","05:51,320","\"and it's gonna be mixed with fans.\""]
["05:51,320","05:54,400","\"But I also think that Frontier's the first time\""]
["05:54,400","05:57,080","\"in a very long time that they're trying something new.\""]
["05:57,080","06:04,760","\"It's been a very long time since they've just done something that wasn't like Sonic running to point like the the generation style sages that they're doing are like in the game\""]
["06:04,760","06:11,600","\"But they're like their side content the actual game itself is like like a Tony Hawk playground\""]
["06:11,600","06:16,760","\"Where you run around and like grind on rails and stuff to get to the next area and like fight enemies and level up and shit\""]
["06:16,760","06:20,660","\"It's very it seems like they ripped off breath of the wild a little bit\""]
["06:20,660","06:21,720","\"They definitely\""]
["06:21,720","06:25,120","\"A lot of games tried to do that after that they ripped off breath of the wild\""]
["06:25,120","06:31,460","\"But it's not the same because it's not open world. It is no it isn't it isn't it's it's separated in hemispheres\""]
["06:31,460","06:36,040","\"breath of the well I don't like breath of a while because it's redundant and\""]
["06:36,040","06:38,860","\"I'm sure how can you hate that amazing game of love\""]
["06:38,860","06:45,040","\"Because I like redundant games I play sonic, but the thing is like the problem\""]
["06:45,040","06:49,000","\"I have with breath of the wild and I don't really want to get in tangent because then I'll start hurting feelings\""]
["06:49,000","06:54,580","\"But like I'll cry I would actually cry it for you. I genuinely hold on. I gotta pay to say this game is visually beautiful\""]
["06:54,580","06:58,380","\"I know it's awesome. I've been heaven. I'm in heaven. Whoa\""]
["06:58,380","07:03,040","\"That was bad. I didn't mean to do that. I gotta pay attention\""]
["07:03,040","07:07,160","\"Were you both meaning to sing to the song properly? No, I fucked up. That's what happens\""]
["07:07,160","07:10,920","\"That song it's like\""]
["07:10,920","07:16,240","\"That was a biggie of reference. I was the star of the green mile. He's in the old man's home\""]
["07:17,480","07:24,040","\"Don't you remember? No, that was just sonic fucking turned around at the exact time that called for an OO and the song I guess\""]
["07:24,040","07:27,780","\"The only part of the grimol. I really remembers the mouse\""]
["07:27,780","07:34,120","\"Traumatize I'm not even kidding is my hamster died. Oh, that happened so he stepped in the house\""]
["07:34,120","07:37,680","\"I was so mad that was the saddest fucking thing\""]
["07:37,680","07:43,320","\"I actually did affect me on a very deep love that movie even though it doesn't really mean anything\""]
["07:44,960","07:48,340","\"Does it need to be something could just be a guy revives a mouse with Greek\""]
["07:48,340","07:54,240","\"He blows fucking bugs out of his mouth. Yeah scarabs out of his mouth with the mouse's body\""]
["07:54,240","08:00,240","\"So\""]
["08:00,240","08:07,280","\"Yeah, I I'm excited for Sonic Frontier's because it feels like Sega's doing something different\""]
["08:07,280","08:14,480","\"They've been playing it safe and forces with the culmination of playing it way too safe and trying to make everybody happy and that only ever makes everybody mad\""]
["08:14,480","08:22,780","\"So when they're doing something new while trying something similar like they're doing the generation style and people talk about asset using and it's like alright\""]
["08:22,780","08:25,300","\"People talk about complaining about fucking reusing assets\""]
["08:25,300","08:31,900","\"Don't even talk to me about that when Splatoon 3 is coming out with the same fucking story mode assets being used in all three fucking games\""]
["08:31,900","08:37,880","\"They don't talk to me about acid reusing okay. There's nothing wrong with reusing assets. It's how you go about it\""]
["08:37,880","08:41,860","\"You can reuse assets and repurpose stuff. I don't like the fact of the reusing stuff\""]
["08:41,860","08:47,760","\"But at the same time I understand why they are because they had this stuff around and they're like we want to add more to the game\""]
["08:47,760","08:51,540","\"They had this big open world and they wanted to add a little more to it\""]
["08:51,540","08:55,720","\"So that's why they did it doesn't bother me as long as it's done well and to me it looks fun\""]
["08:55,720","08:59,880","\"Cory and that's all I care about if they took a crate from Dark Souls one\""]
["08:59,880","09:03,620","\"And used it in bloodborne. I would think I would give it a one out of ten\""]
["09:03,620","09:11,840","\"They fucking used one of those panels that is one of the most fart-smelling critiques you can get\""]
["09:11,840","09:16,080","\"That is like so I found that they reused a thing from you\""]
["09:16,080","09:19,960","\"It should be surprised to realize how many games are repurposed\""]
["09:19,960","09:26,440","\"I'm pretty sure Mario Odyssey wouldn't have exist if it wasn't for Breath of the Wild because I'm pretty sure it used the same\""]
["09:26,440","09:31,480","\"Fucking like stamina thing because that little bar when Mario's swimming is the exact same as\""]
["09:38,920","09:45,160","\"Guaranteed for game engine guaranteed they repurposed Lincoln like gave him like red and blue overalls in the head\""]
["09:45,160","09:53,260","\"No, I'm not joking. I'm not being facetious. I'm serious. I guarantee they reused stuff for because how the fucking they do\""]
["09:53,260","09:55,260","\"To the story no time\""]
["09:55,260","10:01,940","\"Fizz fight no they had an engine with Beth the wild and they've repurposed stuff from over the years\""]
["10:02,940","10:07,500","\"Fight with no weapons with Mario or Zelt Lake waited a fight Mario or Lincoln a fist fight\""]
["10:07,500","10:09,860","\"Well, you can play smash and find out\""]
["10:09,860","10:14,780","\"Sort of that I'm saying like outside of a bar\""]
["10:14,780","10:26,620","\"Really good now that there's no dumbass cutscenes how's that it's good whoops\""]
["10:26,620","10:28,620","\"I\""]
