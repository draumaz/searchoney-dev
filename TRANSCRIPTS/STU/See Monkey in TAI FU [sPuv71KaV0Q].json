["06:21,440","06:27,600","\"I think you're right. I keep thinking of something that does involve like a burning monkey, but I oh my god\""]
["06:27,600","06:32,120","\"I can't put my finger on what there's burning man, but that's a guy. I think\""]
["06:33,080","06:38,840","\"Like like I'm thinking of something that was done in stop motion, but I like I don't think it's\""]
["06:38,840","06:42,620","\"Like a robot chicken thing. It's like the Rudolph the reindeer thing\""]
["06:42,620","06:48,920","\"Yeah, where he lights a realistic monkey on fire and all the can't scream. You know, I realize what I'm thinking of the burning monkey and\""]

["06:54,840","07:01,400","\"Really, it's this new grounds cartoon by a guy called the king of cock and he disappeared after making it\""]
["07:01,400","07:03,960","\"I wonder what happened to that guy.\""]
["07:03,960","07:08,200","\"It's probably worth trying to find the clip of the birding monkey just to illustrate\""]
["07:08,200","07:09,200","\"the point.\""]
["07:09,200","07:12,840","\"And now I'm wondering if, because the monkey has multiple appearances, it was on fire\""]
["07:12,840","07:16,200","\"at some point in the movie, right?\""]
["07:16,200","07:17,800","\"It was pawn shop prick as well.\""]

["07:35,000","07:39,560","\"Yeah, I think so. I mean that's what it is in the pilot. I\""]
["07:39,560","07:45,740","\"Can't remember if I feel like future on the came out and in like 98 though. Oh did it?\""]
["07:45,740","07:51,840","\"I could I'd probably I figured that that was part of the part of the reason why they had it be like\""]
["07:51,840","07:56,760","\"New Year's 2000 when he gets frozen, but I could be wrong here to death\""]
["07:57,320","08:01,660","\"Here's do another crappy one. It was March 99. Oh, there you go\""]

["12:09,840","12:12,620","\"You think you're tough don't you tiger?\""]
["12:12,620","12:15,880","\"Yes, I do\""]

["13:11,360","13:17,920","\"That is true. We're the gorillas specifically named the gorillas because the monkeys were the original like\""]
["13:17,920","13:21,320","\"band to do like animated characters of the band\""]
["13:21,320","13:26,600","\"I think the story behind that is they wanted to be called the gorillas with an S and then they spelled it wrong\""]
["13:28,680","13:33,960","\"But I mean is there did they come alive because monkeys was already taken I guess\""]
["13:33,960","13:39,540","\"Or like was it meant to be in homage to the monkeys? Oh you said the poop phase was easy\""]
["13:39,540","13:43,840","\"You gotta get to the health there is health right there in the left corner\""]
["13:43,840","13:53,240","\"Yeah for those got brave enough to claim it. Oh, he's gotten real fast. Yeah, this is fucking scary. Oh, he's getting increasingly drunk\""]
["13:53,240","13:56,480","\"That is so frustrating. I hate that monkey\""]
["13:57,040","13:59,040","\"Will you beat him for his try?\""]
["13:59,040","14:00,040","\"You threw shit at me.\""]
["14:00,040","14:02,040","\"You finish with like 90% health.\""]
["14:02,040","14:05,040","\"I feel like beating the monkey should be the end of the game, you know?\""]
["14:05,040","14:06,040","\"Troose?\""]
["14:06,040","14:09,040","\"I am my guess.\""]
["14:09,040","14:14,040","\"Kai, you are one bad bossy.\""]
["14:14,040","14:15,040","\"Woah!\""]
["14:15,040","14:16,040","\"I disagree.\""]
["14:16,040","14:18,040","\"And modest too.\""]
["14:18,040","14:20,040","\"*laughs*\""]
["14:20,040","14:21,040","\"Get over here!\""]
["14:21,040","14:25,040","\"I'm gonna show you a groovy move.\""]
["14:25,040","14:30,040","\"You can really use the monkey roll.\""]
["14:30,040","14:33,040","\"- Oh dude, you're gonna get the monkey roll.\""]
["14:33,040","14:33,880","\"- Finally.\""]
["14:33,880","14:38,080","\"- You finally have a dodge roll after more than half the game.\""]
["14:38,080","14:41,120","\"- And if you really wanna get 'em,\""]
["14:41,120","14:44,160","\"you're heading to the roll to let fly\""]
["14:44,160","14:46,120","\"with the monkey bounce combo.\""]
["14:46,120","14:47,720","\"(laughs)\""]
["14:47,720","14:48,560","\"- Snakes.\""]
["14:48,560","14:50,400","\"- So it's just like another leopard thing.\""]
["14:50,400","14:51,880","\"- These are hot.\""]
["14:51,880","14:53,920","\"You ought to see the crings.\""]
["14:54,960","14:57,880","\"But you gotta visit the coast to do that,\""]
["14:57,880","15:04,800","\"and it's not so easy ever since the dragon master handed the cranes over to the wreck.\""]
["15:04,800","15:10,720","\"He keeps the master, Fae-lu, in a gilded cage.\""]
["15:10,720","15:14,480","\"But what are you gonna do?\""]
["15:14,480","15:16,440","\"I can set her free, that's what.\""]
["15:16,440","15:17,680","\"Yeah, right!\""]
["15:17,680","15:22,280","\"Fipoo, uh, Psi-Q, or whatever.\""]
["15:22,280","15:24,280","\"You don't have to take this from this guy.\""]
["15:24,280","15:26,600","\"I say you just fucking leave.\""]
["15:26,600","15:28,600","\"Stupid monkeys.\""]
["15:28,600","15:30,600","\"Okay, whoa dude.\""]
["15:30,600","15:35,140","\"Alright, there were a lot of ways to respond to that and that was not a good one.\""]
["15:35,140","15:38,080","\"Someone ripped that exact file from the game please.\""]
["15:38,080","15:42,400","\"Yeah, take it away.\""]
["15:42,400","15:43,840","\"So I do use the monkey roll.\""]
["15:43,840","15:44,840","\"The double tap.\""]
["15:44,840","15:45,840","\"Look at me go.\""]
["15:45,840","15:47,040","\"See Mario Odyssey ripped this off.\""]
["15:47,040","15:48,040","\"It did.\""]
["15:48,040","15:50,080","\"And did it worse for that matter.\""]
["15:50,080","15:51,720","\"It screamed like a monkey.\""]
["15:51,720","15:54,080","\"Yeah, what the hell how did you learn how to monkey?\""]
["15:54,080","15:57,120","\"stream\""]
["15:57,120","16:00,400","\"You already said that dude\""]
["16:00,400","16:06,100","\"Yeah, but you didn't seem to get it so you didn't seem to let fly with the monkey bounce combo\""]
["16:06,100","16:08,800","\"You let you let walk maybe but not fly\""]
["16:08,800","16:11,560","\"Oh\""]
["16:11,560","16:12,840","\"Fuck\""]
["16:12,840","16:17,480","\"So you can only jump off of those as a monkey. Yes. Got you\""]
["16:17,480","16:20,960","\"Oopsie\""]
["16:20,960","16:23,960","\"What the fuck?\""]
["16:23,960","16:24,960","\"Okay.\""]
["16:24,960","16:25,960","\"Except when you can't.\""]
["16:25,960","16:27,960","\"Chris, why is this game so fucking legit?\""]
["16:27,960","16:29,960","\"I don't know, it's just like the best game.\""]
["16:29,960","16:30,960","\"Ooh.\""]
["16:30,960","16:35,960","\"Ooh, you gotta like, and then roll monkey roll up the ramp, right?\""]
["16:35,960","16:39,960","\"I'm sure as hell try, we didn't really have to do that actually.\""]
["16:39,960","16:41,960","\"Yeah, you could have leopard leaps.\""]
["16:41,960","16:45,960","\"Do not imply that the leopard leap and monkey roll are interchangeable.\""]
["16:45,960","16:49,960","\"I'm not implying that, I'm just saying now that you have the monkey roll,\""]
["16:49,960","16:53,240","\"Let's not forget about our good pal, the leopard leap.\""]
["16:53,240","16:55,240","\"Ah, ah.\""]
["16:55,240","16:59,720","\"Oh, though functionally, I don't see how they differ very much.\""]
["16:59,720","17:05,400","\"Well, one lets you bounce off of paper lanterns and the other one just doesn't.\""]
["17:05,400","17:07,400","\"Yeah, it's kind of shit.\""]
["17:07,400","17:09,400","\"Oh, she's-- God damn it.\""]
["17:09,400","17:10,400","\"Look.\""]
["17:10,400","17:12,640","\"(laughing)\""]
