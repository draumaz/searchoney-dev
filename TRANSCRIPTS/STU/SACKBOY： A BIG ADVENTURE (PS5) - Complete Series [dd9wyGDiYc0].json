["06:05,840","06:10,740","\"I think it was supposed to be like their big like Mario killer, I think, was the idea.\""]

["06:14,380","06:19,180","\"Wait, before that was a thing. I mean that was the idea right where they were like people who make their own fun.\""]
["06:19,180","06:22,360","\"I don't know if it predated Minecraft or not, but it was definitely...\""]
["06:22,360","06:23,660","\"Oh, I'm pretty sure it did.\""]
["06:23,660","06:27,260","\"Definitely like around the same arrow where they were like oh let's give\""]

["06:50,500","06:53,380","\"Okay, we go\""]
["06:53,380","06:55,380","\"Yes\""]
["06:55,380","06:58,820","\"It's actually pretty sick. Yeah\""]
["06:58,820","07:03,100","\"He wants me to get it. Let's see how long till the novelty way is right\""]
["07:03,100","07:07,860","\"Yeah, I mean that's true these games are always like way way better with other people though. Oh for sure\""]
["07:07,860","07:12,500","\"But what did I get I get a new costume piece? What I want that?\""]
["07:12,500","07:19,100","\"I think it's I have no idea. Hey, you even wear the costumes. Oh, you can probably customize your thing\""]
["07:19,940","07:24,780","\"I'm sure it'll teach us in time. Is that a cloud? Can I fuck that up? Oh?\""]
["07:24,780","07:29,320","\"Hey, wait, how'd you do that? I jumped to press triangle. Oh, I\""]
["07:29,320","07:35,620","\"Don't know what triangle does otherwise, but if you press it in midair you yeah, it's like it's like a it's like a face dive\""]
["07:35,620","07:43,180","\"Wait, is there way up? Oh, okay. How'd you do that? Just it just bounces you like a bouncer there. Okay? Oh\""]
["07:43,180","07:47,580","\"We better collect all the things\""]
["07:48,780","07:56,700","\"They're obviously integral. Yeah, no, I'm just habitually collecting shit because my stupid video game at old brain is like this is shiny\""]
["07:56,700","07:59,740","\"I better go for it, but I have no idea what the value of any of it is\""]
["07:59,740","08:05,700","\"I just assume that it has value and that's half the journey Tomar is I'm watching a number tick up\""]
["08:05,700","08:09,140","\"Oh my freaking second\""]
["08:09,140","08:12,580","\"You might as well just play a clicker game I\""]
["08:12,580","08:17,560","\"Know I know if you play that cookie clicker game that game is\""]
["08:17,820","08:23,620","\"I recommend that anybody that wants to get acquainted with actually how stupid they are. Just play that game\""]
["08:23,620","08:29,180","\"That's gonna fucking mean me. Yeah, I mean it's true, right? Like you don't realize like how\""]

["08:38,460","08:45,660","\"Occasionally play just like when I'm bored and I and I can't be bothered to get invested in something\""]
["08:45,660","08:50,820","\"I think the interesting thing about cookie clicker is it doesn't even have the pretense of being good\""]
["08:50,820","08:56,400","\"Like it's just like it's a cookie click it you dumb asshole and then you do it and then it's like okay\""]
["08:56,400","09:02,240","\"You saw the number move now you're addicted and it's just like I thought I thought cookie at least the cookie clicker\""]
["09:02,240","09:07,080","\"I remember playing I felt like you got all the content you needed within like an hour anyway\""]
["09:07,080","09:13,320","\"Well, yeah, I mean that's kind of the point though is like I feel like a lot of games try to build themselves on cookie clicker\""]
["09:13,320","09:16,700","\"and people are like, \"\"I'm having fun with this, but you're not really having fun with it.\"\"\""]
["09:16,700","09:18,960","\"It's just like, cookie clicker, you know what I mean?\""]
