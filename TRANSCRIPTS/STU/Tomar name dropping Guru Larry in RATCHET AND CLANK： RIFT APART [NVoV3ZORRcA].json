["13:48,760","13:54,840","\"Yeah, you think they'd just be making like choices on the fly that would just be destroying the fuck out of everything around them\""]
["13:54,840","13:58,000","\"But they like they react and move like like humans\""]
["13:58,000","13:59,920","\"That's true\""]
["13:59,920","14:05,160","\"Like I'm sure that in lore they do but like it doesn't read to screen\""]
["14:05,160","14:07,760","\"Obviously it would make it would make them way too overpowered\""]
["14:07,760","14:13,800","\"Yeah, because then you couldn't like hide behind a box from them or something or like I'd still be interested to see if they could\""]
["14:13,800","14:16,640","\"Do a movie where they could pull that off and make it work the whole way through\""]
["14:17,400","14:22,160","\"But just like I can't see you so there's a 98.9% probability you're behind that box\""]
["14:22,160","14:27,100","\"Yes, like pretty much if you enter their line of sight you'd be dead like instantly yeah\""]
["14:27,100","14:32,440","\"They wouldn't have to line up the shot. Yeah, you'd just be you'd just be done and they're fucking little like\""]
["14:32,440","14:35,680","\"AI algorithms would have them never miss\""]
["14:35,680","14:40,480","\"Yeah, I feel like they can predict like like the three most likely directions\""]
["14:40,480","14:43,960","\"You'll move and just fire all three bullets faster than you could think like\""]
["14:44,600","14:47,680","\"That would be really interesting at least short film. I don't know\""]
["14:47,680","14:54,600","\"About yeah about someone being hunted by a robot like that and somehow finding a clever way to\""]
["14:54,600","15:00,640","\"To survive that was kind of like that black mirror with the robot dog, but that wasn't very interesting\""]
["15:00,640","15:05,280","\"Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the one he's talking about for some reason I always mix up Cambridge Analytica\""]
["15:05,280","15:09,600","\"I want to say but it's it's the other one the fucking Boston dynamics. Yeah, yeah\""]
["15:09,600","15:14,320","\"Yeah, I don't know like that that's the weird thing is like when you write something like that\""]
["15:14,320","15:19,960","\"You then have to make them like also stupid somehow because otherwise like how would a fucking normal person?\""]
["15:19,960","15:25,200","\"Like live through it. Yeah, or you've got to also make the person a thing\""]
["15:25,200","15:30,300","\"You know what I mean? Oh, yeah, it'd be a thing. You're back in regular people town\""]
["15:30,300","15:34,320","\"And I always was except when I wasn't is this like an overworld?\""]
["15:34,480","15:40,480","\"This is this is like a little side zone you you come here to you'll see\""]
["15:40,480","15:47,240","\"Because I got to do it in a sec. Oh, so it would be it would be kind of a spoiler to tell you what it was\""]
["15:47,240","15:55,200","\"Please do play off. You know what I could smash that but I know it would bother someone a lot if I left it\""]
["15:55,200","16:03,280","\"I\""]
["16:03,280","16:09,440","\"Talk to that. Yeah, no, I refuse to engage with you. Yeah, don't don't let that thing thinks think it's people. No\""]
["16:09,440","16:12,160","\"Look at all these colorful characters\""]
["16:12,160","16:15,920","\"I have a friend who gets really angry when\""]
["16:15,920","16:24,260","\"When he sees robots that are like overly cute. Oh, yeah, yeah, cuz he's like I mean, it's a good point\""]
["16:24,260","16:28,740","\"He's like we can't view robots is these cute things. That's what they're gonna fucking kill us\""]
["16:30,160","16:34,040","\"It's like maybe it's kind of a good point the slippery robot slope\""]
["16:34,040","16:41,280","\"Oh, yeah, it's mr. Zircon our favorite first mate anywhere. I need a signal booster\""]
["16:41,280","16:50,420","\"I love these character designs. Yeah, no, they're good. I like this guy\""]
["16:50,420","16:54,420","\"To win my affection give me the park here\""]
["16:54,420","16:58,480","\"Suck his ass\""]
["16:59,080","17:05,100","\"You must rim my rusty ass you better take a tetanus shot\""]
["17:05,100","17:08,840","\"Because I've been eating nothing but a\""]
["17:08,840","17:20,280","\"Jurgies is a violent spree so take it outside\""]
["17:20,280","17:28,200","\"If you insist dude if you insist I am more lover than fight for you\""]
["17:28,200","17:30,200","\"Oh\""]
["17:30,200","17:38,660","\"Ready to kick some Robo, but I have many issues with that question. How long is this game? Well?\""]
["17:38,660","17:46,640","\"Not super long maybe like ten hours. That's long enough. Yeah, it's it's like it doesn't outstance\""]
["17:46,640","17:51,640","\"It's welcome, but it's not it's not like I think ten hours is perfect for a triple leg game\""]
["17:51,640","17:56,480","\"It was like I when I finished it. I was like that was the the perfect length\""]
["17:56,480","18:03,280","\"I genuinely can't believe I used to enjoy 60 hour games as a kid. I can't even fathom doing that now\""]
["18:03,280","18:05,040","\"Yeah, every now and again\""]
["18:05,040","18:09,200","\"I'll play something that'll actually hold my interest for that long, but usually I'll play like\""]
["18:09,200","18:16,600","\"Two or three hours of something and then if I'm like I kind of get what this is doing. I'll usually put it down\""]
["18:16,600","18:22,440","\"If it's still showing me stuff at like the three to four hour mark and like introducing new shit\""]
["18:22,440","18:23,980","\"then I'm like, okay, I'll keep going.\""]
["18:23,980","18:27,720","\"- So I get addicted to like non-storyish games\""]
["18:27,720","18:31,420","\"for 60 plus hours, like factorial and stuff like that.\""]
["18:31,420","18:36,420","\"But yeah, like the last long story game I played\""]
["18:36,420","18:41,100","\"like that was Persona 5 and that really was just too long.\""]
["18:41,100","18:44,100","\"- I'm playing 3-yard because of 7 right now.\""]
["18:44,100","18:47,700","\"And that's been the first one for a while that's done it.\""]
["18:47,700","18:50,280","\"Although the only reason I stuck with that one\""]
["18:50,280","18:55,040","\"as long as I had it was because Kyle was like you will love this game you just have\""]
["18:55,040","19:00,500","\"to like get into it and I was like okay but I would have almost put it down like I was\""]
["19:00,500","19:05,000","\"like about to and he there was like two separate occasions where he had to be like no just\""]
["19:05,000","19:06,920","\"keep going you're almost there.\""]
["19:06,920","19:09,160","\"And did you get there?\""]
["19:09,160","19:12,240","\"Yeah now I'm there it took a while but now I'm there.\""]
["19:12,240","19:13,720","\"Now I'm there.\""]
["19:13,720","19:18,320","\"If only the game could just have you there from the start.\""]
["19:18,320","19:23,600","\"The prologue was okay, like it definitely set you up, but then it after the prologue then\""]
["19:23,600","19:27,640","\"like the real game starts and then you're back in tutorials.\""]
["19:27,640","19:33,000","\"So yeah, I don't want to bitch about a game we're not even playing, especially not one\""]
["19:33,000","19:37,600","\"that I'm done liking right now, but yeah, I thought you were fighting Captain.\""]
["19:37,600","19:40,440","\"What's his face? No, he pushed out now.\""]
["19:40,440","19:45,560","\"I'm fighting as many lads. This is just this is just an excuse for arena level.\""]
["19:45,560","19:49,640","\"Basically this is where you go to like go to the arena and bathe with people\""]
["19:49,640","19:55,060","\"You know, I mean I was falling until the bathing part well\""]
["19:55,060","19:58,360","\"You should have still been following\""]
["19:58,360","20:01,000","\"Because that's where the real money is\""]
["20:01,000","20:03,480","\"In group bathing. Yeah\""]
["20:03,480","20:06,160","\"It's a growth industry\""]
["20:06,160","20:09,280","\"People love to take baths together to them or they love it. I\""]
["20:09,280","20:12,080","\"mean in some country sure\""]
["20:13,080","20:18,560","\"They love to take bass with strangers no less. Is that a fit? That's got to be something somewhere in some culture, right?\""]
["20:18,560","20:21,040","\"Yeah, in South Korea, I think.\""]
["20:21,040","20:27,240","\"But do they pay the strangers they bathe with or are they the strangers to someone else's bathing experience?\""]
["20:27,240","20:34,120","\"They're they're all the strangers to each other's bathing experience. Yeah, see I feel like there could be a middleman in there\""]
["20:34,120","20:40,960","\"Making a lot of money and that's the niche I want to fill. He's being paid just to bathe with strangers. You're saying paid to bathe\""]
["20:40,960","20:44,560","\"is forced to die. You know the story. It's as old as time.\""]
