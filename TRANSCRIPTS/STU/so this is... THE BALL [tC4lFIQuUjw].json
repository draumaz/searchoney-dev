["04:41,440","04:44,800","\"Wow look at that\""]
["04:45,120","04:50,040","\"It was a little bit interesting of a choice to have a weapon like this on one of those games\""]
["04:50,040","04:56,700","\"Where if you get closer to a wall like the perspective on your gun gets fucked. Oh, I love that. Oh, yeah, I'm a little man\""]

["05:32,320","05:35,480","\"There goes the ball. I didn't they just design a transparent ball\""]
["05:35,480","05:42,220","\"Well like a crystal like a big crystal. It just had like a basic frame, but it was otherwise look just like that\""]
["05:42,220","05:48,220","\"Yeah, that'd be good and you know what it would be better also if you were like a little glove and then you could turn the ball into\""]
["05:48,220","05:52,080","\"Different types of balls maybe bounce the ball is that a reference to Glover?\""]

["06:15,060","06:19,420","\"I saw this puzzle you saw this puzzle it evidently\""]
["06:19,420","06:23,500","\"I'm really clever, you know, they probably should have put that button on like the right or left wall\""]
["06:23,500","06:25,500","\"So I didn't accidentally hit it\""]
["06:25,500","06:29,500","\"There you go come here you\""]
