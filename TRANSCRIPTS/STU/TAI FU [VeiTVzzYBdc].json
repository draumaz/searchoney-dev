["02:54,280","02:59,640","\"Look what time spent caring for me has brought you and the temple all necessary\""]
["02:59,640","03:01,640","\"I have two sets of pecs\""]
["03:01,640","03:03,480","\"I'm dwelling on that which you cannot change\""]
["03:03,480","03:09,640","\"Dwelling if you visit the tiger temple ruins at the edge of the bamboo forest on top of the great hill\""]
["03:09,640","03:14,440","\"Begin to find the answers you seek\""]
["03:14,440","03:18,600","\"All right, brother, pain. I will do as you said brother, ping\""]

["03:28,320","03:35,080","\"Yeah, they just showed up and your guy didn't even notice he was like looking at the scrolls on the wall and then they just like\""]
["03:35,080","03:41,800","\"Slapped him and that was it but then he told the guard to like finish him off and he didn't yeah\""]
["03:41,800","03:46,880","\"He just forgot I think he said go finish off the other guards. Oh, but it's still stupid\""]
["03:46,880","03:52,600","\"They still just left him there. Yeah, they basically just gave you a swirly and then left you alone. This is the tutorial\""]
["03:52,600","03:57,760","\"He just stands there and spouts off shit\""]
["03:57,760","04:06,280","\"See it's fucking cool\""]
["04:06,280","04:10,040","\"That's good. That's good that you don't have to listen to that guy if you already know how to play\""]
["04:10,040","04:13,120","\"That's also better than most games. What you looking at Tomar?\""]
["04:13,120","04:19,740","\"I was looking to see if it was clipping because it's very loud in my all of it turned down just maybe just a tiny bit\""]

["04:21,740","04:27,260","\"Yeah, I can't believe it just starts right into that. There's like there's no subtitles\""]
["04:27,260","04:30,280","\"You can't even really tell who's talking in that first\""]
["04:30,280","04:34,980","\"My favorite thing was that the dragon showed up and he was like I thought you would be cool\""]
["04:34,980","04:36,980","\"But now I see that you fucking suck\""]
["04:36,980","04:42,360","\"He didn't even try to fight you or anything. He just showed up and was like ah nah\""]
["04:42,360","04:45,400","\"Just slapped you into the wall honestly\""]
["04:45,400","04:49,600","\"I like really like the designs - I think the dragon looks cool and typhoon looks cool\""]
["04:49,600","04:53,800","\"He does and this is like every generic like Chinese sound known to man\""]
["04:53,800","05:00,600","\"Pretty much do you think anybody anybody sent this to China to let them know\""]

["05:14,120","05:19,440","\"Wait, no, they're 120 kilobytes each. Isn't that shit? I thought the memory cards are eight megabytes\""]
["05:19,440","05:24,200","\"That's that's what got them to the moon. Tell me that's ps2 that's eight met eight or sixty mags\""]
["05:24,200","05:28,040","\"We got to go to the bamboo forest you guys you know that when they went to the moon\""]
["05:28,040","05:34,560","\"They only had three floppy disks with all of all of Mars command with them all of them. I believe it\""]
["05:35,360","05:41,740","\"They had three floppy disks of that one David Bowie song and that was it and they took it to the moon\""]
["05:41,740","05:47,380","\"I can't believe they'd even use floppy disks with how like unreliable they I know and then they the\""]
["05:47,380","05:49,340","\"the\""]
["05:49,340","05:55,860","\"Spacecraft split in half like because it does that right it drops parts and they dropped one of the floppy disks\""]
["05:55,860","05:57,860","\"So they only had two floppy disks. I\""]
["05:57,860","06:04,060","\"Did not I didn't is that all that true? Yeah, and then they only had two and that's that's all they took to the moon with them\""]
["06:04,060","06:11,720","\"Why would you store one of the floppy disks in like one of the disposable rockets, but that floppy disk held the information for like all their food\""]
["06:11,720","06:18,400","\"I got something and I don't oh it makes me miserable cool\""]
["06:18,400","06:24,120","\"Use your tiger fist of blue there's a lot of blood in this game -\""]
["06:24,120","06:27,520","\"Yeah, DreamWorks was pretty edge at the time\""]
["06:27,520","06:33,440","\"Yeah, like there's that whole spreading scene and sure can we assume this is in universe\""]
["06:33,440","06:38,560","\"and this is just this this is like this is Kung Fu Panda's world like way later when\""]
["06:38,560","06:44,480","\"Ping actually is just the master of it of the temple. He took over the land turned into this\""]
["06:44,480","06:50,620","\"Notice type who have four nipples because he seems to have four packs with the music cut out\""]
["06:50,620","06:52,600","\"What the fuck?\""]
["06:52,600","06:54,040","\"Fuck you\""]
["06:54,040","06:56,040","\"That was just how it loops, I guess\""]
["06:56,040","07:00,000","\"Wait, is he coming back? He didn't cry like a fucking baby\""]
["07:00,960","07:02,960","\"Do you hear that?\""]
["07:02,960","07:04,960","\"Who was that?\""]
["07:04,960","07:13,160","\"Oh, it's it's it's just in the music. Yeah, it's so pretty guy talking in Chinese. It's really scary\""]
["07:13,160","07:19,560","\"It's authentic. Hey, I love you can just do that. It's awesome. Can you do that to everything?\""]
["07:19,560","07:24,280","\"No, just smaller enemies. I think what do you think was walk cycle? It's a\""]
["07:24,280","07:27,680","\"I think it's pretty festive\""]
["07:29,640","07:33,640","\"That was one out of two. Yeah, and that was two out of two\""]
["07:33,640","07:36,280","\"Thank God you can do that\""]
["07:36,280","07:38,200","\"Let me go\""]
["07:38,200","07:40,500","\"There we go. Why does the music keep doing that?\""]
["07:40,500","07:43,160","\"Cuz it's gonna start a new oh\""]
["07:43,160","07:46,560","\"It doesn't loop. It just fades out. Yeah, that's so shit\""]
["07:46,560","07:53,180","\"It they'd like whoever composed the music with no one explained to him that video game music has to loop\""]
["07:53,180","07:56,680","\"There's a bunch of old games that do that and it's like wow\""]
["07:57,280","08:00,240","\"Or maybe they did explain that and he was like I took some liberties\""]
["08:00,240","08:03,400","\"And gave it an outro. Oh\""]
["08:03,400","08:10,680","\"You know a lot of this game is also just like nonsensical spamming of bullshit like there's some fights that you're just met the spam\""]
["08:10,680","08:12,680","\"And it's like designed around that I\""]
["08:12,680","08:20,800","\"Guess if that's a mechanic in the game you can do maybe they just observe that was how everyone played it in the play testing\""]
["08:20,800","08:24,800","\"So they leaned into it. I love you can do that\""]
["08:26,200","08:32,440","\"The fuck you know it seems like they're pretty liberal with the health if it's really the green bar\""]
["08:32,440","08:37,000","\"Yeah, the first two levels are pretty okay. They're easy then it gets kind of scary\""]
["08:37,000","08:44,360","\"Fuck you you really are like the apex predator of this world like nothing so far has been able to stand up to you\""]
["08:44,360","08:50,360","\"I don't actually just look way cooler than everything else and what could stand up to a tiger anyway\""]
["08:51,480","08:58,300","\"Nothing really like a lion or a dragon. Is that dragon any place where there's lions and tigers in the same?\""]
["08:58,300","09:01,340","\"ecosystem in the world zoo\""]
["09:01,340","09:06,980","\"Fair enough. That's why they make zoos Tomar. Yeah, so that they could see who would win in a fight\""]
["09:06,980","09:10,140","\"That would make zoos way cooler. I agree dude\""]
["09:10,140","09:14,420","\"I was trying to find a video of just a gorilla fighting anything\""]
["09:14,420","09:19,660","\"Yeah, and like they really don't like full-on like haymaker anybody\""]
["09:20,660","09:24,980","\"And although they do is dragging you through the ditch a bit. It's a shame. They don't understand how cool\""]
["09:24,980","09:30,100","\"They could be if you get taught them how to box exactly. That's why I love them. They're just like big oafs\""]
["09:30,100","09:35,140","\"They're like hmm. There isn't this is not my observation by any means, but like\""]
["09:35,140","09:40,300","\"We've never seen a gorilla at maximum power because we've never taught one out of like lift weights\""]
["09:40,300","09:44,500","\"That's true, and they're still like all jacked\""]
["09:44,500","09:49,500","\"They just get that size from like eating a bunch of like fruit and and wood\""]
["09:50,100","09:52,100","\"No, what a good fruit and wood\""]

["10:07,660","10:15,380","\"Wait, what that's shocking. There's a card in slot. Okay. We're look. We're nine percent through the game. Oh, ready?\""]
["10:15,380","10:17,740","\"That doesn't sound right\""]
["10:18,100","10:20,100","\"Tomar gorillas eat each other\""]
["10:20,100","10:26,100","\"That's not true. That's baboons. Do they really those fucking psychos elite anything? Yeah, baboons are scary\""]
["10:26,100","10:29,740","\"So are chimps chimps and baboons suck and mccox also suck\""]

["15:47,760","15:49,800","\"There wasn't much better at the time,\""]

["16:11,720","16:12,560","\"- Oh, that's right.\""]

["16:30,160","16:32,080","\"they didn't wanna go like discs,\""]

["16:36,960","16:38,960","\"- Avoid the club and strike when Crusher is--\""]
["16:38,960","16:39,960","\"- They were neurofist.\""]

["16:56,400","16:57,840","\"There's like no other way.\""]

["16:59,040","17:00,160","\"You just got to keep doing that.\""]
["17:00,160","17:03,680","\"You got to keep jumping and punching at him.\""]
["17:03,680","17:04,560","\"Seems to be working.\""]
