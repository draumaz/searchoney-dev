["01:01,060","01:04,400","\"So why is she swinging at them exactly why she physically hitting them with it?\""]

["01:36,760","01:41,260","\"Oh, yeah, I forgot because the way he worked before from when I remember at least maybe I'm wrong about it\""]
["01:41,260","01:48,080","\"But I remember him not being able to protect absolutely everybody in the party. That's actually like more useful than it once was if that's the case\""]
["01:49,880","01:54,940","\"Could be wrong though. I didn't really use him because he's not a very helpful party member. That's gonna mean\""]
["01:54,940","01:57,680","\"I'm sure he tries\""]
["01:57,680","01:59,960","\"Can I go in here? Oh\""]

["02:40,680","02:44,040","\"Damn, he is very close to dying. He's fucked\""]
["02:44,040","02:49,240","\"The thing is too you probably want to give him a lot of defense\""]

["02:53,100","02:57,680","\"You should be a tank if he's gonna be tanking Alex you mean no Rory\""]
["02:57,680","03:02,180","\"But you can't choose what no I'm saying the way that they set him up as a party\""]
["03:02,180","03:09,160","\"I feel like he should have the way that he was introduced and joining your party and everything\""]
["03:09,160","03:11,160","\"I feel like he should be\""]
["03:11,640","03:13,540","\"Or a lot of HP, I don't know.\""]
["03:13,540","03:16,640","\"I'm not using their skills because they always just, I always fuck them up.\""]
["03:16,640","03:17,640","\"I'm too scared.\""]
["03:17,640","03:20,240","\"Some of them are weird too.\""]
["03:20,240","03:24,640","\"I'm hoping there are more like defense oriented mini games.\""]
["03:24,640","03:26,640","\"I mean, that one was new.\""]
["03:26,640","03:31,640","\"Even though when you did pull off specials like they, I remember last time we were playing.\""]
["03:31,640","03:32,640","\"No, most of them don't do much.\""]

["03:33,640","03:35,640","\"I know I didn't understand why.\""]
["03:35,640","03:39,360","\"That's why I think they did rebalance some of this with the combat because your other\""]
["03:39,360","03:43,840","\"party members also barely did damage in the past. It seems like people are able to do things now.\""]
["03:43,840","03:49,280","\"The Velophyte earlier, you are supposed to lose it and in the original version of the game.\""]
["03:49,280","03:51,440","\"Oh, he's about to die.\""]
["03:51,440","03:52,320","\"Thanks, straight.\""]
["03:52,320","03:56,960","\"In the original version of the game, she just has a really big life meter. If you know how to\""]
["03:56,960","04:03,600","\"exploit the game, you can drain it. She heals herself now, so it's better at being set up as a\""]
["04:03,600","04:04,960","\"fight you have to lose.\""]
["04:04,960","04:06,480","\"Aha! You did it?\""]
["04:06,480","04:07,600","\"They'll learn you, mister.\""]
["04:07,600","04:10,760","\"That goes pretty quick. Yeah, they set it up decently\""]
["04:10,760","04:15,120","\"It's not an idea that reads when you see it the first time. Yeah once you get it down\""]
["04:15,120","04:19,600","\"Oh, it's taking so long\""]
["04:19,600","04:27,240","\"You get fast forward hold the right trigger. Oh my god. I forgot about that. Oh my god. I forgot about that\""]

["04:54,240","05:01,520","\"Okay, all right, I forgot Michael's a character and he is present right now\""]
["05:02,240","05:08,100","\"He has instead of word and like what 20 minutes to take some photos make himself useful\""]
["05:08,100","05:11,160","\"Die you fucking rat. I\""]
["05:11,160","05:16,080","\"Got lots of time energy. This is a moment. You want to remember. We got to fight a poop\""]
["05:16,080","05:21,620","\"Yeah, I want to cherish this forever. It says poop. Oh, we go use a poop\""]
["05:21,620","05:26,040","\"Yeah, this one's really easy. Ah\""]
["05:26,040","05:29,760","\"Ah\""]
["05:29,760","05:31,720","\"music's good\""]
["05:31,720","05:37,960","\"There are some decent songs on the soundtrack. I'm wondering because they\""]
["05:37,960","05:42,000","\"did add some new songs. I'm wondering which ones they removed because there are\""]
["05:42,000","05:50,080","\"some really bad songs. Well the first fight with the the not-star man had a\""]
["05:50,080","05:54,640","\"different song originally. It had vocals and the guy's voice cracks. It's a really goofy song.\""]
["05:54,640","05:58,280","\"Maybe they put it, I do remember you mentioning that. Maybe they put it later.\""]
["05:58,280","06:01,960","\"I hope they did. I hope they did. Should I mind dungeon again?\""]
["06:01,960","06:04,040","\"I\""]

["06:07,000","06:11,960","\"You it looks like consistently you can only do it if you have 100 XP.\""]
["06:11,960","06:16,680","\"Another thing with this game's balancing healing items at like vending machines,\""]
["06:16,680","06:21,320","\"they're very silly about it because what their items is rather than yeah,\""]
["06:21,320","06:25,880","\"there are a lot of percentage based healing items that heal most of your health and they're\""]
["06:25,880","06:28,680","\"cheaper than items that heal less of your health.\""]
["06:28,680","06:29,520","\"- Oh.\""]
["06:29,520","06:31,520","\"- So items are weird in this game,\""]
["06:31,520","06:33,040","\"and I give you way too many,\""]
["06:33,040","06:34,520","\"and they're way too generous,\""]
["06:34,520","06:36,040","\"just in general with everything.\""]
