["01:18,420","01:19,420","\"Did you ever play this?\""]
["01:19,420","01:23,720","\"I tried playing it on an emulator when I was like 14 and I couldn't get past this part.\""]

["01:25,420","01:27,420","\"Yeah, interesting.\""]
["01:27,420","01:30,420","\"Yeah, you jump into pieces of paper to play levels.\""]

["01:38,420","01:41,420","\"Yeah, you have to find pieces of paper to jump into.\""]
["01:41,420","01:44,780","\"There's a lot of stuff in this game you're just not gonna know until you play it.\""]
["01:44,780","01:46,260","\"I think I'm just dead.\""]

["02:19,560","02:21,360","\"Here's how the health meter works.\""]
["02:21,360","02:21,860","\"You ready?\""]
["02:21,860","02:22,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:22,360","02:23,560","\"These Z's?\""]
["02:23,560","02:26,460","\"You have to catch them with Bubbles you blow, but see the Bubbles you blow?\""]
["02:26,460","02:30,260","\"They're also attached to a collectible, so you have to collect bubblegums, so you can blow bubbles,\""]
["02:30,260","02:33,760","\"and then use the bubbles to collect the Z's, which go in the Z meter at the top of the screen.\""]
["02:33,760","02:36,860","\"But the Z's can only go inside, these boundaries set right here.\""]
["02:36,860","02:39,560","\"And also you have to hold the Y button down if you want to move the bubble around,\""]
["02:39,560","02:42,560","\"Which the game doesn't tell you what this is crazy\""]
["02:42,560","02:48,240","\"What the hell okay say it just say it what why were they thinking oh?\""]
["02:48,240","02:50,320","\"My god\""]

["03:04,520","03:08,920","\"How can you how can you make a Simpsons game and make it as non-Simpsons as possible?\""]
["03:08,920","03:12,260","\"It's a nightmare so you'll have to do whatever you want and you don't have to have any context\""]
["03:12,260","03:14,960","\"Are you telling me these germs are not a reference?\""]
["03:14,960","03:17,920","\"They're not from like season two episode eight\""]
["03:17,920","03:22,760","\"They're the germs that come to the nuclear power plant they say where are going to tank over this unless\""]
["03:22,760","03:24,760","\"Grown AIDS at Mark Simpson\""]
["03:24,760","03:28,800","\"Over is like why are you here?\""]
["03:28,800","03:32,120","\"Just to talk ill of my boy\""]
["03:32,120","03:37,120","\"There was a green one in a red one.\""]
["03:37,120","03:39,120","\"And there was a little ass man.\""]
["03:39,120","03:43,120","\"He was from an episode. That was season one.\""]
["03:43,120","03:45,120","\"Why is he in your blood? Because he's small?\""]
["03:45,120","03:47,120","\"Because he's a reference to the show.\""]
["03:47,120","03:49,120","\"What is the circle? What is that?\""]
["03:49,120","03:54,120","\"That's like a shield around the paper that you have to break by collecting these.\""]
["03:54,120","03:58,120","\"It's so confusing. What the hell did they make it so confusing?\""]
["03:58,120","03:59,120","\"Into it any of this.\""]
["03:59,120","04:01,120","\"Who's saying hello there?\""]
["04:01,120","04:03,120","\"Yeah, that's what he's saying.\""]
["04:03,120","04:05,120","\"I'm not collecting him because these guys throw grenades.\""]
["04:05,120","04:07,120","\"I don't even remember what his name is.\""]
["04:07,120","04:09,120","\"It's Smiling Bob or something.\""]
["04:09,120","04:10,120","\"You see, he said the end of it.\""]
["04:10,120","04:11,120","\"Where's Smiling Joe?\""]
["04:11,120","04:12,120","\"Fission? Is that it?\""]
["04:12,120","04:13,120","\"I think that's it, yes.\""]
["04:13,120","04:16,120","\"This is a very like ambient game with no music.\""]
["04:16,120","04:17,120","\"There's music.\""]
["04:17,120","04:19,120","\"It's just very subtle here.\""]
["04:19,120","04:20,120","\"It's just...\""]
["04:20,120","04:22,120","\"That's them popping.\""]
["04:22,120","04:25,120","\"I thought it was really cool.\""]
["04:25,120","04:28,120","\"That's a cool melody that got going there.\""]
["04:28,120","04:29,120","\"I got going there.\""]
["04:29,120","04:31,120","\"I want to remix that.\""]
["04:31,120","04:35,520","\"No, that was close.\""]
["04:35,520","04:37,040","\"So those grenades kill you.\""]
["04:37,040","04:38,720","\"That's the only way to die during this one.\""]
["04:38,720","04:39,720","\"Get the fucking paper.\""]
["04:39,720","04:40,720","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:40,720","04:41,720","\"He did it.\""]
["04:41,720","04:42,720","\"Where's the basketball?\""]
["04:42,720","04:43,720","\"Get out of here.\""]
["04:43,720","04:44,720","\"Get Lisa.\""]
["04:44,720","04:46,320","\"This is not going to happen.\""]
["04:46,320","04:48,760","\"You're getting absolutely owned by Jebothi's head.\""]
["04:48,760","04:49,760","\"Okay, you ready?\""]
["04:49,760","04:50,760","\"You ready?\""]
["04:50,760","04:51,760","\"Nope.\""]

["04:52,760","04:54,760","\"Okay, I didn't jump up.\""]
["04:54,760","04:55,760","\"Wait, there we go.\""]
["04:55,760","04:56,760","\"We.\""]

["04:57,760","05:04,560","\"We this is fun. We now get some more paper to have more fun. So you get health for doing that. Oh\""]
["05:04,560","05:07,800","\"You get like an extender meter\""]
["05:07,800","05:11,040","\"So if you can skateboard without hitting anything\""]
["05:11,040","05:16,520","\"It's a good thing. Oh, this one's this one's great. Okay\""]
["05:16,520","05:20,200","\"That is really to accept it\""]
["05:20,200","05:23,880","\"As you ever lied to me before\""]
["05:23,880","05:26,920","\"Only two buttons really matter on this one\""]
["05:26,920","05:33,500","\"and the controls don't really make any sense yeah tell them you get a describe\""]
["05:33,500","05:38,760","\"I'm hitting the A button to shoot here the B button shoots there right on the\""]
["05:38,760","05:43,120","\"D-pad shoots a fireball there right on the D-pad up on the D-pad does that\""]

["05:48,120","05:52,200","\"what actually no I've realized this before but I should maybe not that cool\""]
["05:52,200","05:57,920","\"No games are stupid. Oh no no no no no no no no. Bitcrush screams are the funniest thing. They are literally funny\""]
["05:57,920","06:02,740","\"I was playing some weird Sega game the other day and it had the stupidest bitcrush screams I've ever heard\""]
["06:02,740","06:04,740","\"No, it's laughing every time someone died\""]
["06:04,740","06:11,180","\"What was it called Mario\""]
["06:11,180","06:20,800","\"Mario should scream they don't make him yell enough Mario could be great. We brought it up pretty recently\""]
["06:20,800","06:26,660","\"We were playing Mario World and I miss that in that one when he dies\""]
["06:26,660","06:32,160","\"He has the stupidest fucking face ever that his eyes get all beady in his mouth is open real wide\""]
["06:32,160","06:35,800","\"You know editor do me a favor find a long play of Mario and\""]
["06:35,800","06:40,320","\"Every time he kills a goomba or dies put this over it with super quick rush\""]

["06:47,280","06:49,280","\"There you go. That one was pretty good.\""]
["06:49,280","06:57,920","\"You did it! It's not over. Have you ever played this game called Rampage?\""]
["06:57,920","07:01,920","\"Oh, I've seen this on the AVGN.\""]
["07:01,920","07:05,640","\"Imagine playing Rampage, but you don't punch anything.\""]
["07:05,640","07:08,200","\"You'll blue screen out those windows and put in that episode of AVGN.\""]
["07:08,200","07:13,840","\"Just put an episode in each window.\""]
["07:16,840","07:18,840","\"You know it and it's done, it's done.\""]
["07:18,840","07:22,940","\"And you have to track everyone too.\""]
["07:22,940","07:27,480","\"Why is March Mothra?\""]
["07:27,480","07:31,760","\"Because they start a large throw. They start with Ann.\""]
["07:31,760","07:35,800","\"That's a good joke. That's Bart's brain did that. His subconsciousness did that.\""]
["07:35,800","07:41,960","\"You're not doing the voice right.\""]
["07:41,960","07:43,960","\"You need to set a good down.\""]
["07:43,960","07:48,760","\"You can do it right there. That's close to the house.\""]
["07:48,760","07:52,760","\"I feel more of a purge.\""]
["07:52,760","07:55,960","\"Just quit, and just quit! Just live out the rest of your days knowing that you did your best.\""]
["07:55,960","07:57,960","\"I feel really bad for her. She can't do it anymore.\""]
["07:57,960","07:59,960","\"She literally does sound like she's dying.\""]

["08:26,260","08:30,560","\"I'm really surprised none of these have music, but like I'm not bothered by it.\""]
["08:30,560","08:32,020","\"They're actually fine.\""]
["08:32,020","08:36,940","\"No, it's actually great. It's wonderful. I'm not bothered. It's okay. Yeah, sure.\""]
["08:36,940","08:38,500","\"That's Homer.\""]
["08:38,500","08:39,380","\"There's Homer.\""]
["08:39,380","08:41,460","\"He looks funnier in the show as a monkey.\""]
["08:41,460","08:49,380","\"Why is he dressed like that? He's a peasant from ancient times. A giant peasant? Yeah. See it's big crushed in hilarious\""]
["08:49,380","08:55,400","\"Your response wasn't laughter was you going\""]
["08:55,400","09:02,900","\"You're so right I didn't even laugh\""]
["09:02,900","09:07,300","\"I was on the defense. Oh, oh, oh\""]
["09:09,300","09:11,300","\"You trying to abort you\""]
["09:11,300","09:14,220","\"Yeah with the signal board board oh\""]
["09:14,220","09:18,540","\"Wait, we got to get that. Do you know what that does? What does that?\""]
["09:18,540","09:21,180","\"Three of them it gives you an extra\""]
["09:21,180","09:24,060","\"meter when you run out of health\""]
["09:24,060","09:27,620","\"That bus comes out of fucking nowhere. Yes, it does and it's really annoying\""]
["09:27,620","09:33,460","\"Because it blocks your view. It's a foreground element. It sucks. I'll see you move slower when you have this\""]
["09:33,460","09:35,660","\"But you're invincible\""]
["09:35,660","09:42,620","\"See that didn't hurt. I wish grandpa was walking in the background following you whistling this song. I wish there were ghosts of grandpa here\""]
["09:42,620","09:49,180","\"50 of them walking around. I feel like that's more believable the nightmare for Bart. Does grandpa show up in this game?\""]
["09:49,180","09:52,220","\"I don't remember. No, I don't think he does. This is a nightmare\""]
["09:52,220","09:57,760","\"There you go. Only took you like 10 minutes to find the facts. This game just isn't that good\""]
["09:57,760","10:01,060","\"It's better than most\""]
["10:01,060","10:03,860","\"It's one of the better Simpsons games. It's not very good\""]
["10:04,020","10:10,260","\"This is the famous nostalgia critical let's play I think I think it gets points for being weird\""]
["10:10,260","10:15,380","\"Reference that video that he said like well\""]
["10:15,380","10:19,880","\"I don't want to have another Bart's nightmare, but it's like I don't think you understand why that video didn't work\""]
["10:19,880","10:27,620","\"Because it's just like his regular content you pointed out that the same thing happened with the wall and that it was the idea of like every time he\""]
["10:27,620","10:31,140","\"It's when a different community gets exposed to it\""]
["10:31,140","10:35,260","\"Yes, that it's the idea of people that are not used to putting up with his bullshit. They're like\""]
