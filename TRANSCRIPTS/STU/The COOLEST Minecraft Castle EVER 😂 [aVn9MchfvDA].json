["00:30,560","00:33,960","\"But I bet that's not how he's credited.\""]
["00:33,960","00:37,200","\"- Yeah, it's like something really racist probably.\""]
["00:37,200","00:42,120","\"Why is producer Jew?\""]
["00:42,120","00:44,160","\"(laughing)\""]
["00:44,160","00:45,160","\"- Coach.\""]
["00:45,160","00:47,200","\"Oh yeah, he was the coach.\""]
["00:47,200","00:48,040","\"No, he wasn't.\""]
["00:48,040","00:49,200","\"Why do you use the coach?\""]
["00:49,200","00:52,120","\"- Yeah, who the fuck is that guy?\""]
["00:52,120","00:53,640","\"- He's just some guy that looks like Steven Spielberg.\""]
["00:53,640","00:55,840","\"was the coach from when Adam Sandler was a little.\""]
["00:55,840","00:57,480","\"Yeah, that's like baby Adam Sandler coach.\""]
["00:57,480","00:58,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:58,480","01:01,240","\"No, that's Whitey.\""]
["01:01,240","01:04,160","\"I thought, no, it was totally the Steven Spielberg guy.\""]
["01:04,160","01:05,280","\"Whitey was the ref.\""]
["01:05,280","01:06,240","\"Oh, you're right.\""]
["01:06,240","01:08,080","\"Never mind.\""]
["01:08,080","01:08,640","\"Never mind.\""]
["01:08,640","01:10,080","\"This is what people pay 50 dollars.\""]
["01:10,080","01:15,080","\"You talk about basketball rules and regulations.\""]
["01:15,080","01:16,640","\"You know, that's the worst we'll get away to court\""]
["01:16,640","01:18,640","\"in this algebra that the worst holiday we'll get away.\""]
["01:18,640","01:19,320","\"He's freaking wrong.\""]
["01:19,320","01:21,320","\"That makes it good, I think.\""]
["01:21,320","01:23,320","\"It makes it good\""]
["01:23,320","01:25,320","\"No, I agree it makes you savor it more\""]
["01:25,320","01:29,980","\"Dude Minecraft is actually pretty shit if you really really just like\""]
["01:29,980","01:32,800","\"Think about it pretty hard\""]
["01:32,800","01:38,980","\"You know what if you think a little harder though is actually fucking genius, okay now you've changed my mind\""]
["01:38,980","01:43,600","\"Oh look at this. This is an awesome little wall. We have right here. Let's make it at least five blocks high\""]
["01:43,600","01:49,480","\"I agree this guy's fully panicked. Well, Waluigi's gonna shoot himself. Oh, he got it. He can't get it jump the wall\""]
["01:49,480","01:54,540","\"Hey buddy, we're gonna need to put you in a little place for a little bit\""]
["01:54,540","02:01,480","\"Dude, you know figure out who you are the most fucked up part about this amazing wall is they can just break into it with a pickaxe pretty quickly\""]
["02:01,480","02:09,240","\"That's why it has to be 50 cubes. I'm gonna say obsidian's like the only thing that would really stop the average person\""]
["02:09,240","02:15,100","\"At least makes it look this one of the other second part of this wall is digging a straight hole down\""]
["02:15,100","02:18,600","\"So this is just a straight cliff. That's a good idea\""]
["02:18,600","02:22,720","\"the way down to the obsidian of the planet.\""]
["02:22,720","02:24,400","\"Exactly.\""]
["02:24,400","02:25,080","\"Exactly.\""]
["02:25,080","02:25,880","\"The bedrock.\""]
["02:25,880","02:26,680","\"Is that what it's called?\""]
["02:26,680","02:30,520","\"We're just getting the deepest.\""]
["02:30,520","02:32,080","\"We should do that.\""]
["02:32,080","02:33,480","\"That sounds stupid but fun.\""]
["02:33,480","02:40,000","\"What we should make this like a huge high tower and everything down to the bedrock so they can.\""]
["02:40,000","02:42,600","\"And it just goes like a million feet down so that we can get in.\""]
["02:42,600","02:44,240","\"I wonder how we even do that.\""]
["02:44,240","02:46,600","\"I bet we could have just take a couple.\""]
["02:46,960","02:48,960","\"You're doing creative mode, I think.\""]
["02:48,960","02:51,160","\"Can we go to creative mode while other people don't?\""]
["02:51,160","02:52,660","\"Yes.\""]
["02:52,660","02:53,260","\"Let's do that.\""]

["02:54,260","02:55,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:55,960","02:56,760","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:56,760","02:57,260","\"All right.\""]
["02:57,260","02:57,960","\"Let's do it.\""]
["02:57,960","02:58,660","\"OK.\""]
["02:58,660","03:01,560","\"We can because we're not doing anything that requires.\""]
["03:01,560","03:04,260","\"I don't know if it'll tell them we're going into creative mode or not.\""]
["03:04,260","03:05,860","\"Do you care if it does care?\""]
["03:05,860","03:07,760","\"All right.\""]
["03:07,760","03:09,460","\"That's a fun little activity.\""]
["03:09,460","03:11,560","\"Did see that?\""]
["03:11,560","03:14,160","\"Oh, no, I guess Zach you would have seen that because you're.\""]

["03:16,460","03:17,780","\"Oh, I did see stupid ugly.\""]
["03:17,780","03:20,660","\"How are we going to do this?\""]
["03:20,660","03:21,980","\"This is going to be amazing.\""]
["03:21,980","03:25,140","\"Yeah, I think everybody's seeing that or I don't know.\""]
["03:25,140","03:26,220","\"Hard to say.\""]
["03:26,220","03:28,900","\"All right, I'll be our be.\""]
["03:28,900","03:36,140","\"What the hell is that little Jewish man up to something is seriously fucked up.\""]
["03:36,140","03:40,380","\"So I could just spawn TNT and just blow huge craters into the ground, right?\""]
["03:40,380","03:41,420","\"Chris, we should do.\""]
["03:41,420","03:45,260","\"Let's build this really high to literally like one block under right\""]
["03:45,260","03:47,780","\"to delete the house put like a billion things of the day.\""]
["03:47,780","03:49,780","\"Let's do it.\""]
["03:49,780","03:53,580","\"Okay, I want to try and spawn TNT then see what happens.\""]
["03:53,580","03:56,140","\"Okay, we should go and say guys were having a meeting.\""]
["03:56,140","03:57,860","\"Let's have a little bit of blood up.\""]
["03:57,860","04:00,420","\"Guys family meeting.\""]
