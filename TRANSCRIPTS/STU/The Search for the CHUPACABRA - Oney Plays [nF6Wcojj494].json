["06:12,280","06:20,000","\"What's going on me? We're good. I guess we're not gonna play the game properly. We're just gonna explore the jungle\""]
["06:20,000","06:25,560","\"Yeah, I mean like a PI would yeah, that's not good. You can't you got you don't have like a knife or\""]
["06:26,080","06:31,840","\"Or any kind of like a minecraft sword do you I don't think so I feel like there might have been something back at your camp\""]
["06:31,840","06:33,840","\"That you're supposed to pick up\""]
["06:33,840","06:38,440","\"I don't know that it could kill a man, but he did pick up some kind of a knife\""]
["06:38,440","06:40,440","\"I don't know if he picked it up this time\""]
["06:40,440","06:47,400","\"See if that opens your image tab open the open this screen. Oh, okay, but I put K. Let's try I oh\""]
["06:47,400","06:55,080","\"Leafs when I was leaves there seems to be a lot going on under the hood that I have absolutely no interest whatsoever\""]
["06:55,080","07:00,080","\"And exploring yeah, there were all those statistics that it started you with that I wouldn't want to have to worry about\""]
["07:00,080","07:05,440","\"Yeah, yeah, like a hunger meter and a poison meter all I know is I saw the word chupacabra and I was interested\""]
["07:05,440","07:10,780","\"I hope we find it. Yeah, I want to at least glimpse it. Yeah. What the fuck is that?\""]
["07:10,780","07:15,620","\"Is the chupacabra supposed to be in the Amazon? Why are the trees high?\""]
["07:15,620","07:19,160","\"It's Mexico. You must be able to cut those down. Yeah\""]

["07:23,600","07:28,840","\"Oh, it gets gray when you're at a breath. Oh, I guess let's give it a sec\""]
["07:28,840","07:33,900","\"This guy needs to like toughen up if he's gonna be out in the jungle as a PI\""]
["07:33,900","07:37,900","\"I think someone probably just hired him and sent him out here as a joke\""]
["07:37,900","07:42,760","\"You were playing as a complete pinhead right now. Yeah, he was like\""]
["07:42,760","07:48,080","\"Okay, I got fired from my job at the hot dog stand\""]

["07:55,440","07:56,960","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:56,960","08:01,160","\"Some like douchebag who gives you like a check\""]
["08:01,160","08:03,920","\"that's inevitably gonna bounce for like 2000 bucks\""]
["08:03,920","08:05,400","\"to go find the Chupacabra.\""]
["08:05,400","08:08,120","\"- Maybe that's the twist, is it's just the Chupacabra\""]
["08:08,120","08:10,400","\"and like a little trench coat\""]
["08:10,400","08:13,400","\"standing on two other Chupacabras and shoulders.\""]
["08:13,400","08:15,800","\"- That's your original employer.\""]
["08:15,800","08:19,640","\"- Look at what the fuck is raining.\""]
["08:19,640","08:21,040","\"- Is it raining men?\""]
["08:21,040","08:23,120","\"- It is the rain forest.\""]
["08:23,120","08:23,960","\"- Woo!\""]
["08:23,960","08:26,720","\"- It was actually like a really nice,\""]
["08:26,720","08:28,920","\"like I could put this on and falsely through it.\""]
["08:28,920","08:31,920","\"- It's just a decent soundscape of nothing else.\""]
["08:31,920","08:34,520","\"They purchased a very nice soundscape.\""]
["08:34,520","08:35,600","\"- They stole it.\""]
["08:35,600","08:37,560","\"- You've got predator vision on something over there.\""]
["08:37,560","08:39,360","\"- Wait, what's it highlighting over there?\""]
["08:39,360","08:40,720","\"You should just go toward that.\""]
["08:40,720","08:42,400","\"- Yeah, you should combat it.\""]
["08:42,400","08:45,160","\"You know, we don't really have anything to lose\""]
["08:45,160","08:47,560","\"by trying to sneak into those like army guys camp\""]
["08:47,560","08:49,200","\"and steal all their guns or something.\""]
["08:49,200","08:50,040","\"- Yeah, when you die,\""]
["08:50,040","08:53,560","\"There's a seed to be much of a setback.\""]
["08:53,560","08:54,840","\"But let's go over here.\""]
["08:54,840","08:58,720","\"- We wouldn't be any worse off than we are right now.\""]
["08:58,720","09:01,240","\"- My fucking guy is so fat, move faster.\""]
["09:01,240","09:02,000","\"- Yeah, I'm gonna be honest,\""]
["09:02,000","09:03,960","\"this is probably the worst I've felt in years.\""]
["09:03,960","09:05,480","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:05,480","09:08,320","\"I just like making the trees clip through the other trees.\""]

["09:22,240","09:27,600","\"Like the Kookaburra or whatever I always thought that was a monkey whenever I heard it\""]
["09:27,600","09:40,640","\"Was nice there's there's a video of like\""]
["09:40,640","09:45,900","\"It's like a Justin Bieber song and someone stretched it out to like 45 minutes\""]
["09:45,900","09:53,720","\"Oh, yeah, and it it sounds like this weird like funky like ambient like it sounds like something that would play in a crystal cave in a video game\""]
["09:53,720","09:57,920","\"Yeah, and they put it over the video of the space station or something is really bizarre\""]
["09:57,920","10:01,340","\"But you know that video inspired the soundtrack to the movie dread\""]
["10:01,340","10:08,400","\"Really? Yeah, you know whenever there's like a slow-mo moment in dread. He was directly inspired by that Justin Bieber video\""]
["10:08,400","10:13,880","\"To do what like whenever so in that movie there's a drug called slow-mo and whatever they take it\""]
["10:13,880","10:16,920","\"Like that's exactly the sound you hear when they take it alright\""]
["10:16,920","10:20,600","\"Yeah, I remember there was a sick scene where you like threw a guy off of staircase\""]
["10:20,600","10:25,780","\"And then he was just falling down the stairs for years. Yeah. Yeah, that was it. I wish that was a real truck\""]
["10:25,780","10:32,040","\"That'd be so fun. Why you want to fall down the stairs for for years? No, but I like to do other stuff for years\""]
["10:32,040","10:36,520","\"This is dude, that looks like it's the normal tree over there\""]
["10:36,520","10:41,160","\"I think that that would probably be like could because even something that would be cool right like coming\""]
["10:41,240","10:47,020","\"That moment of ejaculation would be like can you think of how horrible it would be to hear the letter P\""]
["10:47,020","10:55,000","\"But for 26 minutes it would probably be an experience like that where it would just start to hurt after a while\""]
["10:55,000","10:57,960","\"Nobody nobody\""]

["15:02,980","15:05,920","\"I learned from other games that knives kill you in one slice\""]

["15:25,180","15:31,140","\"Yes, I yeah, you better get the fuck out of there. There's a little a hut where to the to your right like a pizza hut\""]
["15:31,140","15:37,380","\"Yeah, but without the pizza part. We already saw that. Did we go in it? Yeah, that was the Mayan origins\""]
["15:37,380","15:41,740","\"No, no, I think it's like right you're you're not gonna kill that I\""]
["15:41,740","15:47,820","\"Refused to believe that you're his bones coming out. Yeah, there's like human chunks you're cutting out of that. Okay\""]
["15:47,820","15:51,020","\"That's not the same HUD is it I\""]
["15:51,020","15:54,500","\"Don't think that's the same hot dude\""]
["15:54,500","15:59,820","\"This one yeah, that's definitely different. Yeah, that's what I was talking about. Okay whole time\""]
["15:59,820","16:04,060","\"There's a spider\""]
["16:04,060","16:08,880","\"There's two spiders old legs either spider. This is the spider house. They live here\""]
["16:08,880","16:13,660","\"They're kind of cute in a weird way. Yeah, probably married and stuff. They probably bond for life and then\""]
["16:13,660","16:18,900","\"Yeah, rag doll barrels. Well, then he did them a small mercy killing. Yeah, I guess\""]
["16:18,900","16:23,640","\"Was that break it? It said break. Did it really? Yeah, click on it again. Oh\""]
["16:23,640","16:30,940","\"That's the sound of a break is the idea that you have to drop something into that slot that you're going to use to break it\""]
["16:30,940","16:34,460","\"Oh, maybe that's very unintuitive if so\""]
["16:34,460","16:38,020","\"Let's try it though. Yeah, that would make sense with the meat\""]
["16:38,020","16:45,740","\"It inevitably explode that doesn't make any fucking sense\""]
["16:45,740","16:48,660","\"Tomar, why did you code it like that?\""]
["16:48,660","16:53,660","\"Yeah, that's right. This is a call-out pose. I've been found out already\""]
["16:53,660","17:00,100","\"We're coming out. We're saying that this is Tomar's game. No this is a sponsored video\""]
["17:00,300","17:06,300","\"It's not true man. Tomar literally paid us money out of pocket to play this on this channel. It's not true man\""]
["17:06,300","17:11,180","\"This is a breach of contract and I'm not paying you anymore\""]
["17:11,180","17:15,660","\"This is Tomar's love and care that went into this spider biting animation\""]
["17:15,660","17:20,260","\"Stupid thing I've ever seen\""]
["17:20,260","17:21,260","\"Oh my god!\""]
