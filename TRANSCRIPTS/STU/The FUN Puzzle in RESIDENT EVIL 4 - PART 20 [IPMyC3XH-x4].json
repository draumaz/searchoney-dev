["02:57,500","03:05,360","\"Thanks, bro. I've been playing this ever since I was a boy. A wee lad. She got the key. She can get out. Go Ashley.\""]
["03:05,360","03:07,360","\"Before I kill you!\""]
["03:07,360","03:08,740","\"(Laughs)\""]

["03:36,200","03:40,400","\"Don't spot me don't spot\""]
["03:40,400","03:44,000","\"This scary\""]
["03:43,960","03:49,540","\"Now what can actually is really good spooky music. I love this section of the game. I do too. I love the castle\""]
["03:49,540","03:50,280","\"I\""]
["03:50,280","03:53,240","\"Think the reason why people love this game so much is because of the castle\""]
["03:53,240","03:57,000","\"That would make sense to me. I always heard people say oh funny\""]
["03:57,000","04:02,800","\"Little Napoleon. I know I love him too. He's way more memorable than most of their villains\""]
["04:02,800","04:07,520","\"But what the thing is I would say that it's so much more than that. This game has a lot of charm\""]
["04:07,520","04:11,500","\"I like the location a lot in this game. I also like how it plays\""]
["04:12,040","04:15,040","\"It's fun how it controls. I know people don't like tank controls\""]
["04:15,040","04:19,120","\"But I think this game at least figured out something pretty solid with it. I like tank controls\""]
["04:19,120","04:26,000","\"I'll never get over why people hate them so much having a 180 button and being able to have decent targeting and everything careful\""]
["04:26,000","04:27,160","\"I don't mind them\""]
["04:27,160","04:32,480","\"Leave your luck. I think God hand made me into a believer in this game too both of these games\""]
["04:32,480","04:41,760","\"Dydic does God have either the God hand have tank controls. Yeah, cuz it's Mikami. It's it's similar\""]

["04:45,760","04:46,760","\"Scaling difficulty.\""]
["04:46,760","04:47,760","\"Go bashly.\""]
["04:47,760","04:50,760","\"Bash that button, bashly.\""]
["04:50,760","04:51,760","\"Good job.\""]
