["00:23,440","00:26,340","\"That's, I think that's the first time I've ever heard it spoken aloud.\""]
["00:26,340","00:29,240","\"It's, like, uh, it's a sea creature.\""]
["00:29,240","00:31,960","\"It's a little like shellfish type thing.\""]

["00:36,680","00:38,200","\"Who wouldn't?\""]
["00:38,200","00:41,040","\"- That's actually the original developer's wet dick\""]
["00:41,040","00:44,040","\"hitting his desktop.\""]
["00:44,040","00:45,080","\"- I've been excited for this.\""]

["00:47,320","00:50,640","\"- Yeah, we played the demo and it was a lot of fun.\""]

["00:52,440","00:56,080","\"- That sound again.\""]

["01:04,180","01:08,360","\"- It only has about like 15 feet of history.\""]
["01:08,360","01:13,900","\"- 15 feet of history is what I call my dick.\""]
["01:13,900","01:16,060","\"- This is just gonna be the dick episode.\""]

["01:19,780","01:21,860","\"- Jimmy Carter dick.\""]
["01:26,460","01:27,900","\"Now this is a video game.\""]
["01:27,900","01:28,720","\"See that?\""]
["01:28,720","01:31,020","\"It feels good too.\""]
["01:31,020","01:33,900","\"- Is that your tongue or is that just a lot of your spittle?\""]
["01:33,900","01:35,900","\"- It's my little spittle.\""]

["01:48,020","01:49,660","\"- Oh my God, you're right.\""]
["01:49,660","01:51,460","\"I still can't wait for that X-O-1 game either.\""]

["01:54,860","02:01,860","\"with little balls bouncing around or flying or swinging or singing or doing anything really\""]
["02:01,860","02:05,740","\"what more could you want in life this guy looks like gooey from Kirby you remember gooey\""]
["02:05,740","02:12,140","\"from Kirby he does look like that shit the uh was gooey the fish gooey was not the fish\""]
["02:12,140","02:17,340","\"gooey was like the little blue guy that shows up in Kirby 3 oh who's basically he's got\""]
["02:17,340","02:21,740","\"the same powers as Kirby except he licks and he looks almost exactly like this and I'm\""]
["02:21,740","02:27,580","\"Connecting some dots here. I was gonna say I was obsessed with Kirby - where they introduced the little like animal friends\""]
["02:27,580","02:30,420","\"But I don't know any of their names. I don't think I ever did\""]
["02:30,420","02:33,820","\"This is the kind of game that feels good to just blast through it as fast as you can\""]
["02:33,820","02:37,060","\"You got a blast faster. I'm trying\""]
["02:37,060","02:43,300","\"Oh yeah, you do that you saved it come on recover recover recover\""]

["03:03,340","03:05,340","\"I feel like you learned more\""]
["03:05,340","03:08,500","\"Struggling up the side of those than you would have doing it the right way\""]
["03:08,500","03:14,380","\"I told you or if the game had landed you with some annoying tutorial level instead of just throwing you right into it\""]
["03:14,380","03:18,820","\"Yeah, no, thank God for this. I think we always learn best through failure\""]
["03:19,060","03:22,180","\"Would you agree Chris that fear of failure is the greatest?\""]
["03:22,180","03:27,940","\"Obstruction to learning no, I think that people who fail from the beginning or losers that should give up\""]
["03:27,940","03:32,020","\"See unless you get something perfect your first try\""]
["03:32,020","03:38,620","\"You heard it here folks. Don't pursue anything. You can't get right on your first try just drop it\""]
["03:38,620","03:44,540","\"You clearly can't do it you either got it or you don't okay as they say in the biz\""]

["03:52,620","03:55,620","\"- Learning how to learn, if that makes sense,\""]
["03:55,620","03:59,220","\"is like a really valuable life skill in general.\""]
["03:59,220","04:01,580","\"- Yeah, if anything, that's what the best thing\""]
["04:01,580","04:03,900","\"you could take out of school,\""]
["04:03,900","04:06,140","\"'cause nothing else will actually stick.\""]

["05:15,400","05:16,720","\"- And like everything.\""]
["05:16,720","05:18,920","\"- And taurine, pretty much it's like a cocktail\""]
["05:18,920","05:20,840","\"of everything that is either proven\""]
["05:20,840","05:23,600","\"or just widely believed to give you energy.\""]

["05:31,120","05:33,400","\"is like trying to drill to the center of the earth\""]
["05:33,400","05:37,760","\"to create a massive like graphite wire that--\""]
["05:37,760","05:40,160","\"I do recall that being real.\""]
["05:40,160","05:41,720","\"- It is real.\""]
["05:41,720","05:44,240","\"- You take that energy and you bring it up.\""]

["05:58,560","06:00,640","\"But you know what, prove me wrong asshole.\""]
["06:00,640","06:02,440","\"Get to the center of the earth.\""]

["06:04,160","06:05,000","\"on the ground.\""]
["06:05,000","06:06,640","\"- Yeah, that must be so fun.\""]

["06:12,440","06:13,760","\"- Yeah, we can do that.\""]
["06:13,760","06:16,820","\"It's just gonna take a long time and a lot of money\""]
["06:16,820","06:17,800","\"that's not in refundable.\""]
["06:17,800","06:19,120","\"- We definitely need to figure out\""]
["06:19,120","06:22,320","\"how to actually get up the walls properly.\""]
["06:22,320","06:23,280","\"Can I, can I try for a sec?\""]
["06:23,280","06:24,680","\"- Oh, for sure.\""]
["06:24,680","06:25,520","\"Let me just.\""]
["06:25,520","06:26,360","\"- There's one guy in the con,\""]
["06:26,360","06:28,960","\"who's actually punching his forehead with his palm right now.\""]

["06:30,760","06:32,640","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:32,640","06:34,280","\"'Cause we just failed to grasp it.\""]
["06:34,280","06:35,960","\"Did you guys ever have cousins growing up\""]
["06:35,960","06:39,780","\"They always had holes in their walls that they didn't repair yeah, I\""]
["06:39,780","06:43,900","\"Guess not specifically cousins, but I certainly had friends\""]
["06:43,900","06:47,200","\"What is it with males and putting holes in the wall?\""]
["06:47,200","06:51,960","\"It's a fair drywall is pretty pathetically weak. That's true\""]
["06:51,960","06:56,040","\"It is super empowering when you actually find out that you're strong enough to do it. Oh\""]
["06:56,040","07:00,040","\"Wait, you can jump up like that\""]
["07:00,040","07:03,440","\"I guess that works\""]
["07:03,760","07:08,740","\"See it wasn't all good teach you is just to go vertical just I don't know to release\""]
["07:08,740","07:12,280","\"I think that's exactly what it was trying to teach you okay, okay, okay\""]
["07:12,280","07:18,140","\"So sometimes swinging is not your best friend. I guess is the point there now you were doing good\""]
["07:18,140","07:23,840","\"Listen man. If I've learned anything about this video game is it's silly. Yeah\""]
["07:23,840","07:31,440","\"What do you think these little mushrooms are they not cute um I think they're pretty adorable like\""]
["07:32,440","07:36,420","\"Dorkable I would I would use the the Japanese term kawaii\""]
["07:36,420","07:42,800","\"Thanks, hmm in case you didn't know that one. Mmm. This is a very frustrating topic\""]
["07:42,800","07:48,960","\"Cuz I'm not getting any yeah. Oh my god\""]
["07:48,960","07:55,560","\"We okay, you're a little bouncing bean of a boy look at me go a la look at me go\""]
["07:55,560","07:59,200","\"Where do I go?\""]
["08:00,120","08:03,740","\"I tried it. We wouldn't do it. Okay. Here we go. Let's try that again\""]
["08:03,740","08:12,520","\"Oh my god, that's cool. Is that what that was supposed to do? Maybe I guess that's that's very like sonic adventure\""]
["08:12,520","08:16,700","\"This is working a good way. This is where Jim Carrey gets banished. Yes, it is\""]
["08:16,700","08:22,500","\"Wait, what's that under there? I see you. Who are you mate with it? I got an achievement\""]
["08:22,500","08:29,500","\"Can I bounce from underneath? Okay now that wouldn't really make sense never in a million years\""]
["08:29,500","08:31,500","\"I\""]
["08:31,500","08:36,360","\"Already forget what's this game called again crumble crumble it's a weird name\""]
["08:36,360","08:41,880","\"It is swing. Yeah, why isn't it called Licky tongue swing man? Yeah, I like wet wet ball\""]
["08:41,880","08:49,960","\"Laying oh my god. Holy shit. Yeah, whoa make this a sonic game\""]
["08:49,960","08:54,560","\"I think it's actually really fair to compare this to sonic and that it does a lot of things that\""]
["08:55,060","09:01,340","\"Sonic could be doing better. It's true. Imagine if I was sonic right now. I feel amazing\""]
["09:01,340","09:05,060","\"Instead you're a ball. Oh god even better\""]
["09:05,060","09:11,520","\"Yeah, you really cut out the middleman by always being a ball. Yeah exactly\""]
["09:11,520","09:18,640","\"Sonic what's the worst part of sonic when he's not a ball when he's not curled up\""]
["09:18,640","09:21,600","\"This is fine as a line. Oh\""]
["09:22,540","09:27,960","\"Oh, this is why it's called crumble see this crap. Oh, is everything crumbles beneath you beneath your might\""]
["09:27,960","09:30,860","\"God, this is fun\""]
["09:30,860","09:34,980","\"Seems like everyone's better at making sonic then Sega. Yeah, exactly\""]
["09:34,980","09:40,860","\"It's like the original creator of sonic said he said when he's spine is it I'm I say nine\""]
["09:40,860","09:42,860","\"This was during world war two\""]
["09:42,860","09:47,060","\"I say nine picked up a little bit of German, but yeah\""]
["09:49,660","09:53,660","\"That's a little known fact is sonic was actually developed by Nazi scientists\""]
["09:53,660","09:56,660","\"They at the tail end of world war two\""]
["09:56,660","10:03,560","\"Nazi scientists basically invented like rocket technology and a bunch of radio goddess into space and banana splits\""]
["10:03,560","10:05,560","\"I thought radio\""]
["10:05,560","10:07,620","\"predated world war one\""]
["10:07,620","10:09,620","\"Yeah, you're right\""]
["10:09,620","10:13,180","\"Maybe don't do that anymore\""]
["10:13,180","10:17,180","\"Oh, yeah\""]
["10:17,620","10:21,900","\"That is that does look very fun. It's satisfying to watch\""]
["10:21,900","10:24,420","\"Everything is good when you go fast\""]
["10:24,420","10:31,780","\"They also did kind of take the design philosophy of like if you put lines on something you'll like see how fast you're going from sonic\""]
["10:31,780","10:36,080","\"Lines yeah like in green Hills own with like lines on the lines\""]
["10:36,080","10:37,420","\"Yeah, like lines on the floor\""]
["10:37,420","10:42,520","\"Yeah, if they were like vertically away from the camera like like there you can't really see how fast well\""]
["10:42,520","10:44,420","\"You can't because of the shadows and the light\""]
["10:44,420","10:49,820","\"Wait, you know what you keep talking. I'll shut up. It's just over. It is your channel. You talk more asshole\""]
["10:49,820","10:52,500","\"Okay, today we're gonna talk about blue\""]
["10:52,500","11:00,540","\"The color blue the blur the blue bomber versus the blue blur who will win did anyone actually call him the blue bomber?\""]
["11:00,540","11:08,820","\"Yeah, yeah, I feel like they tried to make that stick because they were jealous of of of the blue blur or something\""]
["11:09,620","11:16,720","\"To be fair I thought I did love both franchises to death back back in the night. I just cannot get into Mega Man\""]
