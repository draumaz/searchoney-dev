["19:28,320","19:30,040","\"I'd let her stab me in the head.\""]
["19:30,040","19:33,440","\"Just whatever like a local theater group they could scrounge out.\""]
["19:33,440","19:34,340","\"Maybe you're right.\""]
["19:34,340","19:39,520","\"Do you think this is like someone out of an improv troupe that they just recruited?\""]
["19:39,520","19:40,680","\"I don't know.\""]
["19:40,680","19:42,440","\"I don't think it's that far, Fedge.\""]
["19:42,440","19:44,040","\"No, you're probably right.\""]
["19:44,040","19:47,960","\"It might have even been like somebody from the office.\""]
["19:47,960","19:48,440","\"Yeah.\""]
["19:48,440","19:50,880","\"Like it might have been like their secretary or something.\""]
["19:50,880","19:55,680","\"This is still from an era where voice acting was not taken that seriously in anything,\""]
["19:55,680","19:59,240","\"but maybe a few like select AAA games.\""]
["19:59,240","20:04,340","\"even that voice acting as kind of a weird history going back to like Disney and\""]
["20:04,340","20:10,600","\"stuff yeah way back in the day they were they would not let people say that they\""]
["20:10,600","20:14,280","\"voice characters because Disney was like they must believe that Snow White is\""]
["20:14,280","20:20,320","\"real really yeah well so the girl voice Snow White couldn't say she did it what\""]
["20:20,320","20:24,960","\"the fuck it's so strange the silo is where the Glorax have been nested I'm sure\""]
["20:24,960","20:30,300","\"The Glorax. That's like a future I'm an alien. Yeah, that is the Glorax.\""]

["20:33,740","20:36,180","\"Where are you stupid?\""]
["20:36,180","20:42,260","\"We watched a... We watched a modern Simpsons episode the other day.\""]
["20:42,260","20:47,220","\"And I'm actually flabbergasted at how bad that show has gotten.\""]
["20:47,220","20:49,260","\"Which... Are you talking about the feminist episode?\""]
["20:49,260","20:52,380","\"I mean, all the... We watched a few of them.\""]
["20:52,380","21:00,180","\"They were all in like absolutely just awful. I couldn't like I kind of figured it would be like family guy\""]
["21:00,180","21:01,580","\"We're overall would be kind of shit\""]
["21:01,580","21:07,380","\"But like you know just by by sheer force of one out of a hundred jokes that they throw out\""]
["21:07,380","21:11,380","\"Yeah, it's gonna have to land right it's actually worse than the way worse\""]
["21:11,380","21:18,780","\"It's actually shocking how bad it's got I don't think a single person writing for that show actually gives a shit about it\""]
["21:18,780","21:25,340","\"Yeah, I mean they did a parody of pod people in the year of our Lord 2020, so...\""]
["21:25,340","21:27,260","\"Or 2019, probably.\""]
["21:27,260","21:27,860","\"But...\""]
["21:27,860","21:29,180","\"Holy shit.\""]

["21:32,100","21:34,180","\"Oh, and you finally have a gun.\""]
["21:34,180","21:37,020","\"You know why they did a parody of pod people, Tomar?\""]
["21:37,020","21:38,540","\"Do you want to take a guess?\""]
["21:38,540","21:39,740","\"Wait.\""]
["21:39,740","21:42,940","\"They wanted... They called the episode \"\"ipod people.\"\"\""]
["21:42,940","21:44,140","\"You know, the iPod.\""]
["21:44,140","21:45,660","\"The thing that exists still.\""]
["21:45,660","21:49,220","\"No, that sounds like it was written by like a 50 year old dad.\""]
["21:49,220","21:51,620","\"Maybe you're probably right.\""]
["21:51,620","21:53,020","\"That's how I felt about that.\""]
["21:53,020","21:56,780","\"There was like that Futurama episode where it was like the whole thing was about\""]
["21:56,780","22:01,460","\"like the iPhone, but it was like five or six years after the iPhone had come out.\""]
["22:01,460","22:03,780","\"And then also it was about Susan Boyle.\""]
["22:03,780","22:05,420","\"Maybe that's a different episode.\""]
["22:05,420","22:06,100","\"I don't know.\""]
["22:06,100","22:10,900","\"But there was a joke way after anyone cared about America's got talent or any of that.\""]
["22:10,900","22:12,220","\"Like the voice stuff.\""]
["22:12,980","22:20,080","\"And it was like the joke was that Lila got a boil and it was voiced and looked like Susan Boyle\""]
["22:20,080","22:26,340","\"I am dead serious. That's awesome. That's not funny, but it's funny cuz it's not\""]
["22:26,340","22:34,060","\"Some of the most out of touch people seem to write for the like the old bad graining shows look at him go loud\""]
["22:34,060","22:37,060","\"He uses green slime\""]
