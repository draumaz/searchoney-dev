["20:55,020","21:02,900","\"But I didn't care because I wasn't doing anything. I've definitely seen so much fucking conversations about this game of how fucking amazing and perfect it is\""]
["21:02,900","21:09,140","\"It's so fucking generic. It blows my mind. We're gonna get so much shit for this. You realize that love\""]

["21:12,300","21:20,220","\"SpongeBob battle for bikini bottom is not as good as you remember it being I think that's a pretty fine for kids, but\""]

["21:34,220","21:38,980","\"I think we're definitely gonna get the people that say like you didn't do this move\""]
["21:38,980","21:45,820","\"Like like if we use the sponge hover right here that Chris has been conveniently forgetting about that would\""]
["21:45,820","21:51,100","\"Automatically just change his perception of the game immediately. He'd be like the sponge hover\""]
["21:51,100","21:58,580","\"This this means it's good now. I think the problems we have with this game on a fundamental level go farther than like whether or not\""]
["21:58,580","22:04,320","\"We're good at it. I'll even admit that Chris is terrible at this game. Look at him go. He's just a moron\""]
["22:04,320","22:10,560","\"But I don't know if anything it's a testament to how far we've come with video games\""]
["22:10,560","22:16,260","\"That's something like this that you thought was great as like a six-year-old is now like so behind the times\""]
["22:16,940","22:20,600","\"You know they added anything to this game like did when they when they remade it\""]
["22:20,600","22:23,300","\"They spine you through the webcam now if you play this yeah\""]
["22:23,300","22:26,460","\"Well, that was the addition so they can see all of our dicks right now\""]
["22:26,460","22:29,060","\"Yes, you know we do only plays pantless\""]
["22:29,060","22:35,780","\"It's above like 65 degrees that you're yeah, we stripped down. Oh, yeah, I'm going to the King jellyfish, okay\""]
["22:35,780","22:38,100","\"That's my fault. I wasn't paying attention\""]

["22:49,840","22:57,020","\"SpongeBob doesn't know how to communicate the way we communicate so he does it through bullying just through violence and aggression\""]

["23:52,860","24:00,020","\"Mermaid man's body's so fucking scary\""]
["24:00,020","24:10,860","\"I guess the implication is that he massaged his feet off\""]
["24:10,860","24:16,660","\"One second in that fuck you at least you can hit them that makes me happy\""]
["24:16,660","24:19,200","\"Yeah, I'm using the elderly is fun\""]

["24:39,420","24:42,420","\"Crazy\""]
["24:42,420","24:50,020","\"So based on what type of game this is I'll bet that this is like somebody's Mario 64\""]
["24:50,020","24:55,740","\"What do you mean that it's kind of like a collect-a-thonny sort of like I don't know\""]
["24:55,740","25:02,780","\"Maybe maybe it defined to someone's childhood in a similar way. Oh, no dude. So many people's childhoods completely. I mean I don't think it's horrible\""]
["25:02,780","25:05,860","\"I just don't understand it's got such crazy. I just is not a bad game\""]
["25:05,860","25:09,300","\"I think that's the promise has been over a hype. That's not even the fault of the game really\""]
["25:09,300","25:16,740","\"Overhyped I just think it was kind of like a middle of the road game from like 15 years ago\""]
["25:16,740","25:20,500","\"A lot of it is nostalgia positive of it and also I'll tell you the other thing too\""]
["25:20,500","25:24,780","\"I think it's that most of the spudg fob games that came out around this time sucked\""]
["25:24,780","25:28,460","\"Yeah, we're like really bad. I remember that\""]
["25:28,460","25:33,460","\"So this was like the best of any of them by far. I think was I guess that would make sense\""]
["25:33,700","25:36,480","\"Simpsons hit-and-run versus all the other Simpsons games. Oh, yeah\""]
["25:36,480","25:40,560","\"Yeah, the best game ever made but compared to all the other Simpsons games. It's it's pretty good\""]
["25:40,560","25:45,500","\"Yeah, that's actually pretty good point plus SpongeBob is the ultimate thing beloved by all children\""]
["25:45,500","25:50,800","\"Yeah, I did I hated fucking spud. I feel like I did play like most of the SpongeBob games\""]
