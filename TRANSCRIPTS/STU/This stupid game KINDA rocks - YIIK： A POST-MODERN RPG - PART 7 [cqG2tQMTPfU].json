["00:05,520","00:06,560","\"Do you mean that?\""]
["00:06,560","00:07,680","\"I actually do like it.\""]
["00:07,680","00:09,360","\"Do you mean that?\""]
["00:09,360","00:11,160","\"It's really stupid, but I enjoy it.\""]
["00:11,160","00:12,160","\"I think it's worth trying.\""]
["00:12,160","00:13,720","\"I think it's entertaining.\""]
["00:13,720","00:14,960","\"I think it's interesting.\""]
["00:14,960","00:18,040","\"I think it's worth looking into, even if it's not\""]
["00:18,040","00:20,440","\"necessarily of high quality in any way.\""]
["00:20,440","00:22,160","\"I honestly love the art.\""]
["00:22,160","00:22,760","\"Everything's cool.\""]
["00:22,760","00:24,920","\"I think there's a lot of cool visuals in there.\""]
["00:24,920","00:27,800","\"I think the soundtrack has some decent songs here and there.\""]
["00:27,800","00:33,440","\"Would you still go with your what you used to say about how it's like the room of video games?\""]
["00:33,440","00:37,640","\"Uh, I don't know how I would you give more credit than that?\""]
["00:37,640","00:43,800","\"No, I give it more credit than that because there are things here that you can tell there are a lot of areas that if they just\""]
["00:43,800","00:46,680","\"Did it in the right way? I probably could have worked out really well\""]
["00:46,680","00:51,800","\"It's just a lot of weird missteps left and right the biggest problems the writing\""]
["00:51,800","00:54,280","\"Yeah, and some of the voice acting\""]
["00:55,400","01:00,120","\"Even then I would not say that anybody is really deplorable. Oh, you can't go the next floor. Oh\""]
["01:00,120","01:03,160","\"69 okay, sorry Merlin\""]

["01:35,040","01:36,640","\"- I'm not really worried about how I look.\""]
["01:36,640","01:38,320","\"I'm more concerned about how I feel.\""]
["01:38,320","01:40,800","\"- Now that I hear these characters talk again.\""]
["01:40,800","01:43,000","\"(laughing)\""]
["01:43,000","01:45,560","\"- Maybe I take back all the compliments.\""]
["01:45,560","01:47,320","\"- Well, no, 'cause you know what I look.\""]
["01:47,320","01:49,440","\"- I am pretty bugged by the lady.\""]

["02:02,320","02:03,480","\"when you can already see what's in the room?\""]
["02:03,480","02:05,360","\"- And if like reading the script,\""]
["02:05,360","02:07,120","\"I'm sure it's completely stylistic.\""]
["02:07,120","02:08,640","\"- Yeah, I'm sure it was intentional.\""]
["02:08,640","02:11,440","\"- But it's a very strange decision nonetheless.\""]
["02:11,440","02:14,960","\"- We can go to Windtown to see where the elevator girl was.\""]
["02:14,960","02:15,800","\"- Yeah.\""]

["05:13,200","05:14,240","\"Is that Wizard so so?\""]
["05:14,240","05:17,400","\"Yeah, I was thinking that I was just\""]
["05:17,400","05:18,920","\"imitating the voice that Chris was doing.\""]
["05:18,920","05:22,560","\"But you know, if Alex for me sounded like Wizard so so I\""]
["05:22,560","05:24,720","\"would like him a lot more.\""]
["05:24,720","05:25,760","\"He'd be a lot more entertaining.\""]
["05:25,760","05:28,080","\"But then you'd miss the point.\""]
["05:28,080","05:29,000","\"It's true.\""]
["05:29,000","05:33,080","\"No, Kerberfer is 100% perfectly casted for the scary.\""]
["05:33,080","05:33,640","\"I agree.\""]
["05:33,640","05:35,120","\"Yeah, I agree.\""]
["05:35,120","05:37,000","\"I love the way he says.\""]
["05:37,000","05:38,480","\"She seemed almost happy to see us.\""]
["05:38,480","05:39,480","\"She's like, oh.\""]
["05:39,480","05:41,480","\"That's true.\""]
["05:41,480","05:44,480","\"She's so... I think she's... I think she's cute.\""]
["05:44,480","05:45,480","\"That's okay.\""]
["05:45,480","05:47,480","\"I like the way she scowls.\""]
["05:47,480","05:49,480","\"I want a girl to just fuck it.\""]
["05:49,480","05:50,480","\"It hates me, right?\""]
["05:50,480","05:53,480","\"She was some sort of legal cleric and how many...\""]
["05:53,480","05:56,480","\"She was a legal age and it was time to make my move.\""]
["05:56,480","05:58,480","\"He did say \"\"cleric\"\" didn't he?\""]
["05:58,480","05:59,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:59,480","06:00,480","\"She was a legal cleric.\""]
["06:00,480","06:03,480","\"There's been a couple of instances of that where they like,\""]
["06:03,480","06:06,480","\"use a word that's similar enough that I don't mind,\""]
["06:06,480","06:09,880","\"I feel like that one's really right in the line.\""]
["06:09,880","06:11,720","\"- It's an RPG, Julian.\""]
["06:11,720","06:14,120","\"In modern times, you can be a legal cleric.\""]
["06:14,120","06:16,080","\"- I honestly feel like they should have just\""]
["06:16,080","06:18,400","\"like not done this art stuff up front\""]
["06:18,400","06:19,960","\"and should have just animated the characters.\""]
["06:19,960","06:21,440","\"- Because games like Persona are the RPGs.\""]
["06:21,440","06:25,080","\"- No, I know, but the background characters\""]
["06:25,080","06:27,680","\"are so much more like charming than the foreground ones.\""]
["06:27,680","06:30,880","\"- I also imagine it's done just to save trouble and hassle.\""]
["06:30,880","06:31,720","\"- So you can keep it.\""]
["06:31,720","06:32,560","\"- That way they don't have to animate.\""]
["06:32,560","06:34,560","\"- Yeah, that makes sense.\""]
["06:34,560","06:35,840","\"- Speed up development time.\""]
["06:35,840","06:37,840","\"I read about it in a Korean newspaper.\""]
["06:37,840","06:39,740","\"Shut up.\""]
["06:39,740","06:41,240","\"*laughter*\""]
["06:41,240","06:44,240","\"I don't like you anymore.\""]

["06:48,740","06:49,840","\"Yes.\""]
["06:49,840","06:50,340","\"*sigh*\""]
["06:50,340","06:51,340","\"It's hard to say.\""]
["06:51,340","06:53,340","\"You look vaguely ethnic.\""]
["06:53,340","06:56,840","\"Maybe it'd be best if you just didn't mention race again.\""]
["06:56,840","06:59,340","\"Why is she being so fucking mean, dude?\""]
["06:59,340","07:01,340","\"Of course you were taking photos of her.\""]
["07:01,340","07:02,340","\"Exotic.\""]
["07:02,340","07:03,840","\"Okay, he is being a creeped man.\""]
["07:03,840","07:04,840","\"None of the other girls around here.\""]
["07:04,840","07:07,960","\"I encourage you to call somebody ethnic.\""]
["07:07,960","07:11,960","\"Please just stop. This is seriously uncomfortable now Alex.\""]
["07:11,960","07:16,520","\"What did I do? Am I not allowed to comment on anything?\""]
["07:16,520","07:18,520","\"Oh wait that's my boater.\""]
["07:18,520","07:23,480","\"Oh god it's not from you I swear.\""]
["07:23,480","07:26,600","\"What did she say like?\""]
["07:26,600","07:28,520","\"I came into the bus this way.\""]
["07:28,520","07:30,600","\"She looks so pissed off in her model.\""]
["07:30,600","07:32,440","\"She's not like finger wagging at you.\""]
["07:32,440","07:34,280","\"She better stop that or I'm gonna break it.\""]
["07:34,280","07:37,560","\"You're right. I've been naughty. I've been a naughty boy.\""]
["07:37,560","07:40,280","\"It's almost like no one cares that she's missing.\""]
["07:40,280","07:41,280","\"*sigh*\""]
["07:41,280","07:43,320","\"Sigh. I love her, you know.\""]
["07:43,320","07:44,520","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:44,520","07:46,360","\"Oh, Alex, you don't have to sigh.\""]

["07:50,360","07:52,360","\"Look at that bass we're going.\""]
["07:52,360","07:54,360","\"It's hurting your eyes.\""]
["07:54,360","07:56,360","\"It's something felt off.\""]
["07:56,360","07:59,560","\"Something felt off. Kind of like I really pissed her off or something.\""]
["07:59,560","08:01,560","\"The Sammy I met was strange.\""]
["08:01,560","08:04,040","\"She didn't seem like the kind of girl who could have felt like\""]
["08:04,040","08:08,040","\"The reality was shifting. My pants, they got tighter.\""]
["08:08,040","08:10,040","\"[laughter]\""]

["08:20,040","08:25,040","\"Times were so much better in the 90s, you didn't have GPS, so you got lost, and it was fun.\""]
["08:25,040","08:27,040","\"Yeah, it's true you see new places.\""]
["08:27,040","08:29,040","\"You could ride a bus and then maybe die after.\""]
["08:29,040","08:32,040","\"You would really go into Venturing. Is this not Windy Town?\""]
["08:32,040","08:36,080","\"Why that's bus stop in the middle of nowhere. Where's Wendy down? Oh\""]
