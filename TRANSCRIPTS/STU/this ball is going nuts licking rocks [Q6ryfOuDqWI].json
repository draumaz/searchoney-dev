["01:58,460","02:04,720","\"Yeah, and then humans would look at it for generations and generations to come because they're being pranked\""]
["02:04,720","02:09,000","\"I hate to tell you but if you've ever been to the Grand Canyon and looked at it\""]
["02:09,000","02:11,000","\"That was the prank and you fell for it\""]

["04:26,160","04:31,640","\"Probably was some form of church. I like the idea that they had to figure out literature on\""]
["04:31,640","04:37,240","\"the spot to like write that receipt for the goats. Yeah. Like oh fuck okay how do we\""]
["04:37,240","04:42,440","\"I'm just gonna draw this this weird thing and it's gonna mean goat and then I'll just draw it\""]

["08:50,620","08:55,720","\"But I really doubt it. I really do think that is the reality behind the scenes of anything like that\""]
["08:55,720","09:00,920","\"It's like it's always made in the most cynical possible way by the most cynical people\""]
["09:00,920","09:04,620","\"Oh, yeah, of course\""]
["09:04,620","09:07,320","\"Yeah, yeah, I'm red\""]

["09:21,940","09:26,280","\"Like, if it's kid stuff, okay, you gotta put like a good moral or whatever in there, you can't be like,\""]
["09:26,280","09:31,720","\"this character murdered 65 people and it's fine, but if you're making shit for adults,\""]
["09:31,720","09:34,720","\"do you really have to put like a moral of the story?\""]
["09:34,720","09:36,720","\"I would argue no.\""]
["09:36,720","09:41,560","\"There's no requirement to storytelling that says that there has to be a moral.\""]
["09:41,560","09:42,560","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:42,560","09:48,400","\"I don't know, I just feel like a lot of shit gets criticized for not doing that, and it's just like,\""]

["09:49,700","09:52,540","\"I mean, I agree. I'd say anyone has the right to\""]
["09:52,540","09:56,940","\"To postulate that kind of criticism, but at the same time\""]
["09:56,940","10:03,140","\"Yeah, I think everyone has just as much of a right to like ignore that sort of criticism. Dude, this game is awesome\""]
["10:03,140","10:04,260","\"I swear shit\""]
["10:04,260","10:11,540","\"Yeah, it only really gets dicey again when like if if you're making your your thing for like a like a deliberately younger audience\""]
["10:11,540","10:17,740","\"Yeah, like people who are still impressionable and still like learning about the world come on get me there, baby\""]
["10:17,740","10:18,580","\"- Oh my God.\""]
["10:18,580","10:19,400","\"- Whoa!\""]
["10:19,400","10:22,280","\"- But yeah, when you're telling a story for adults,\""]
["10:22,280","10:25,100","\"there's some fair assumption that they already know\""]
["10:25,100","10:27,100","\"a thing or two about how the world actually works.\""]
["10:27,100","10:27,920","\"- I don't.\""]
["10:27,920","10:30,240","\"I need morals or I don't know what to think.\""]
["10:30,240","10:31,080","\"- That's true.\""]
["10:31,080","10:33,940","\"- Anything that's like an explorative sort of narrative\""]
["10:33,940","10:36,120","\"gets like weird criticism for that.\""]
["10:36,120","10:37,640","\"I'll see people that are like,\""]
["10:37,640","10:39,700","\"Tyler Durden is a weird fascist\""]

["10:40,960","10:42,540","\"It's like, that's kind of a point.\""]
["10:42,540","10:44,120","\"You're supposed to think he's cool\""]
["10:44,120","10:45,840","\"and that's supposed to make you uncomfortable\""]
["10:45,840","10:46,680","\"when it's like, oh yeah.\""]
["10:46,680","10:48,320","\"That actually is what the cult dude.\""]
["10:48,320","10:50,320","\"That's what makes it relatable.\""]
["10:50,320","10:55,400","\"Yeah, there's a lot of really shitty people who are charming.\""]
