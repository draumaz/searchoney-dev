["02:35,580","02:37,580","\"Yeah. Yep.\""]
["02:37,580","02:39,580","\"Irrefutable.\""]

["03:03,580","03:05,580","\"You just scoffed on his food.\""]
["03:05,580","03:09,580","\"Is that this guy's only idol, is that he leans forward in cuffs?\""]
["03:09,580","03:13,580","\"Oh, no, he brushes himself.\""]
["03:13,580","03:16,580","\"I want to see his other idols now that we say it.\""]
["03:16,580","03:19,500","\"Actually pretty surprised they even put idols in there\""]
["03:19,500","03:24,260","\"What\""]
["03:24,260","03:29,620","\"The what so the yawn I don't know what it's supposed to be because his face never changes\""]
["03:29,620","03:32,700","\"His body so ridiculously perfect\""]
["03:32,700","03:35,940","\"He is pretty cut\""]
["03:35,940","03:40,340","\"That's his theme\""]
["03:44,500","03:48,140","\"This is maybe that a little bit of a problem with modern video games\""]
["03:48,140","03:55,500","\"They went through the trouble of like modeling the little lines on his knuckles. Yeah, but they didn't make a good game\""]
["03:55,500","03:57,980","\"Yep, why would that come first?\""]
["03:57,980","04:00,800","\"No, you're right\""]
["04:00,800","04:03,740","\"They literally put like facial pores on him\""]
["04:03,740","04:06,540","\"I'm willing to bet that they didn't even model this guy\""]
["04:06,540","04:13,300","\"They literally just like bought a resource back and they're like this guy's our main character actually look look look at detail that is\""]
["04:13,900","04:16,500","\"So what I'm saying they probably just bought this thing\""]
["04:16,500","04:22,500","\"Or they just had enough money to pay one guy to make one decent model for their main character\""]
["04:22,500","04:28,660","\"His beard is insanely high res. When did this come out? I don't know didn't say like 2013 or no\""]
["04:28,660","04:33,700","\"I'm thinking of something else. That sounds about right does that sound okay?\""]
["04:33,700","04:39,420","\"I actually think his face is more detailed than the said new Halo the Halo game with the brutes\""]
["04:39,900","04:44,420","\"Yeah, people were like complaining that the brutes face looked really low res\""]
["04:44,420","04:51,180","\"They should have just done that yeah, they should have they should have hired the developers of this game to make halo. I agree\""]
["04:51,180","04:52,420","\"I\""]
["04:52,420","05:00,140","\"Can't believe people would scribble on a perfectly good building like that. Mmm. These doors have like little markings on them from when Moses did a plague. Oh\""]
["05:00,140","05:06,140","\"My god, do they yeah, they were like don't play Gus Moses, and he said okay\""]
["05:06,700","05:12,000","\"That part of that movie's so scary because you mark the door when the white lights coming down\""]
["05:12,000","05:14,580","\"Ew, why are you gray?\""]
["05:14,580","05:18,700","\"See these are just gray men you can't be gray\""]
["05:18,700","05:22,740","\"They're getting gray on me\""]
["05:22,740","05:27,700","\"This I like that. I love looking at NPCs and games\""]
["05:27,700","05:36,460","\"There's gray Colonel Sanders, he's got a weird like long torso in a\""]
["05:36,460","05:38,780","\"strange like cylindrical head\""]
["05:38,780","05:45,020","\"And he's selling her tea pots. This is quite the bizarre. Whoa\""]
["05:45,020","05:50,100","\"That's a long woman next to you. Oh, this woman's meowing at me\""]
["05:50,100","05:57,380","\"Look at her torso is like really long. What's up with that? I know there's a lot of long people here\""]
["05:57,380","06:00,500","\"Also, she's like her legs aren't long just her middle\""]
["06:02,180","06:07,780","\"He took the beans you keep stealing food. Yeah, you took those beans and you didn't even give any to the cat\""]
["06:07,780","06:13,980","\"Does this cat really fucking wanted that bad? It's crazy. Yeah, and this guy's just ignoring it\""]
["06:13,980","06:17,860","\"You there. I just give the cat a little piece of shwarma\""]
["06:17,860","06:20,140","\"That would kill it\""]
["06:20,140","06:23,820","\"It's like chocolate for them shwarma is chocolate for cats as\""]
["06:25,860","06:30,860","\"Just choked it down that guy's ass crack.\""]
["06:30,860","06:33,860","\"That was a bald guy, a bald, what, blind?\""]

["07:08,660","07:13,800","\"Marrakesh is the big cool city that looks like this, right?\""]
["07:13,800","07:14,800","\"Is it? I don't know.\""]
["07:14,800","07:20,200","\"If you go though, I pray that you be safe.\""]
["07:20,200","07:22,040","\"This is a good game, actually.\""]
["07:22,040","07:24,560","\"Like I'm getting immersed in the world now and it feels real.\""]
["07:24,560","07:34,560","\"It feels like I'm there. It really does. I can practically smell the garbage. It really feels like I'm here. Look how high res that fucking garbage bag is.\""]

["09:19,340","09:27,640","\"Yeah true crime was kind of a GTA clone, but it was like you you were like a like a loose cannon cop undercover\""]
["09:27,640","09:31,420","\"And then they had a cheat code where you could play a Snoop Dogg\""]
["09:31,420","09:38,020","\"There was a whole game where you play Snoop Dogg. It was called Snoop's big adventure. Yeah, is that really true? No\""]

["10:41,380","10:48,800","\"I don't know just maybe maybe figure out our unarmed combat system before we start adding in little nice story\""]
["10:48,800","10:53,320","\"Flourishes maybe the people who made this game really were passionate though\""]
["10:53,320","10:57,500","\"About this yeah, I\""]
["10:57,500","11:05,800","\"Wouldn't even entertain that as a possibility. I wonder if is about to be a fight. They're better not be I don't like fighting\""]

["11:18,500","11:22,380","\"He was just there the game runs whoa, okay?\""]
["11:22,380","11:25,580","\"Okay, I just kind of hovered over that that's good good\""]
["11:25,580","11:29,280","\"Gain it on him. Where is he? Oh?\""]
["11:29,280","11:32,400","\"Grab it by the snoot\""]

["11:39,420","11:42,060","\"You could probably throw that out of your something head. Oh\""]
["11:42,060","11:46,140","\"He's so far ahead now\""]
["11:46,140","11:48,220","\"Or you can catch him I\""]
["11:48,220","11:53,100","\"Can't sprint anymore even though this would probably be the most important time to sprint\""]
