["00:22,200","00:26,000","\"It's after he dies, spoiler alert, and it's when-\""]
["00:26,000","00:28,000","\"Like he's like, saying that-\""]
["00:28,000","00:31,120","\"There's a woman that kisses him on the eyeball man really oh yeah\""]

["00:37,760","00:42,000","\"It was for the sake of the shot. You're not supposed to think about that hard\""]
["00:42,000","00:44,640","\"I but it's like she kisses the camera, but his camera is his eye\""]
["00:44,640","00:47,120","\"So she kissed him on his eyeball his open eye\""]

["00:50,720","00:57,040","\"No the game bugged out had two of the same. He still had a beta eye and so it was literally just like a big camera lens\""]
["00:57,600","01:02,040","\"I think they're a she so she knew she just thought of it like a camera and just the lens\""]
["01:02,040","01:05,000","\"You just made your own\""]
["01:05,000","01:12,500","\"Backstory, yeah, there's always beta robo-com you can all the same parks throughout that process fan figure adding on they were enhancing it\""]
["01:12,500","01:17,780","\"I don't want to talk the man bun no more. I'm sick of this guy's conversation. Good thing you can skip ahead\""]
["01:17,780","01:24,720","\"I'm just gonna do this. That's a good feature. Is this like the movie click where you're on autopilot\""]
["01:24,720","01:27,340","\"I've got the click little remote in my hand right now\""]
["01:27,340","01:35,180","\"Okay, I don't know I don't want to skip ahead. No, no, I don't want to skip ahead no more\""]

["01:52,280","01:58,740","\"What what's happening this feels like it's glitching yourself. Yeah, this is supposed to be happening, but yeah, I know what you mean\""]
["01:58,740","02:06,820","\"Film I understand now, but every time it cuts in the textures popping it out\""]
["02:06,820","02:12,300","\"It's also a little bit weird when it's this doesn't work as well when it's POV it works better when you're seeing like two characters on screen\""]
["02:12,300","02:15,580","\"Look at that. What the fuck was that?\""]
["02:15,580","02:21,280","\"Did you see that it means they have to have all these scenes like preloaded for this to work\""]
["02:21,280","02:30,500","\"Yeah, it's not working right. Okay. I don't want to be as friends. Also what facade what facilitating this I don't think I\""]

["02:48,280","02:53,360","\"Clearly thieves too. You know what? That's a pretty clever way to cut ahead without having to deal with it\""]
["02:53,360","02:57,840","\"It would be cool if it wasn't bugging out. It's like a movie trick. Yeah\""]
["02:57,840","03:04,680","\"Did we\""]
["03:04,680","03:10,040","\"We didn't really get the shoes of physique did we I kind of wanted them to be like really skinny\""]
