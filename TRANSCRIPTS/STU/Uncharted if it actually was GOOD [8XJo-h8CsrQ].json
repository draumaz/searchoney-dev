["17:56,660","17:59,780","\"You didn't use the ladder you know what most games don't\""]
["17:59,780","18:05,260","\"We better still have that fucking thing\""]
["18:05,260","18:11,340","\"Got two now you do yeah, all right, but I don't know where that was leading to you may still need to go take that path\""]
["18:11,340","18:16,060","\"No, I don't spring inspect down over here. Yeah, see there's where it was\""]
["18:16,060","18:21,340","\"Well, we haven't kicked all these pots yet if you press up on the D pad you can get periodic hints\""]
["18:21,660","18:28,660","\"Maybe try that really press up on the d-pad some artifacts may be located inside pots. I already knew that press it again\""]
["18:28,660","18:31,540","\"some artifacts may be\""]

["19:16,860","19:21,600","\"Uh, it's funner to pad out a game that otherwise is unimpressive.\""]
