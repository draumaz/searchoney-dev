["00:12,200","00:15,200","\"Actually, that's- that's impossible.\""]
["00:15,200","00:15,900","\"*laughs*\""]
["00:15,900","00:17,900","\"I guess you could eat half of it, and then technically you-\""]
["00:17,900","00:19,500","\"You cannot have your come and eat it too.\""]
["00:19,500","00:21,900","\"You'd sort of fulfill those parameters.\""]

["00:28,400","00:29,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:29,400","00:36,140","\"Because there's no value to cake other than as a food like but you mean you get you get the the notion at least right\""]
["00:36,140","00:40,780","\"I get the notion, but it's but it's still you can have your cake any to two if you don't need all of it\""]
["00:40,780","00:46,280","\"That's true. You can have like like most of your cake except for the slice\""]
["00:46,280","00:53,240","\"You have half your cake and eat half of it too. I think the implication is that like oh, but what if the cake is like a really\""]

["00:59,000","01:04,960","\"anyway stupid I hate it I hate that saying I mean it's it's not the best metaphor it's\""]
["01:04,960","01:09,120","\"like the implication is that like well you can't have everything you want it's like just\""]
["01:09,120","01:16,000","\"say that but why not try yeah yeah why not at least go for it you know it I mean the literal\""]

["10:06,760","10:07,600","\"- No.\""]
["10:07,600","10:12,080","\"- The games have started portraying her as more of a bitch,\""]
["10:12,080","10:15,400","\"but she's like, she thinks she's justified.\""]
["10:15,400","10:17,440","\"But she got it as well.\""]
["10:17,440","10:19,600","\"Yeah, only 'cause it worked out.\""]

["11:11,520","11:12,360","\"I don't know.\""]
["11:12,360","11:15,080","\"Probably because they didn't like her, so they wanted to make sure that she felt physical\""]

["11:16,080","11:17,080","\"No.\""]
["11:17,080","11:21,480","\"You know, the more they've tried making her human, the more unlikable she's become.\""]
["11:21,480","11:25,800","\"Because in the first game, you know, she's just a, she's a clever little AI.\""]
["11:25,800","11:27,080","\"She's a brain clone.\""]
["11:27,080","11:30,960","\"The smart AI is like Cortana and her.\""]

["11:36,240","11:42,000","\"So I think what Halsey did was she cloned herself like 30 times and mashed all their brains together\""]
["11:42,000","11:47,920","\"Oh, and then cloned that brain and that's what Cortana is. Oh, I remember there's like something\""]
["11:47,920","11:54,080","\"where like they like go into her lab and there's like a bunch of like slippery like dead Halsey\""]
["11:54,080","11:58,200","\"fetuses and they're like what the fuck did you do she's like what I had to do\""]
["11:58,200","12:07,060","\"Wait a minute. Hmm. Yeah, I wasn't expecting them. It's okay. It's Omar. You get to kill him. I\""]
["12:07,060","12:10,560","\"Just want to keep them\""]
["12:10,560","12:17,200","\"Are they really five foot tall yeah, they just look smaller cuz you're like nine foot\""]

["12:23,500","12:27,460","\"So the brutes must be like 20 feet tall. They're pretty fucking big. I\""]
