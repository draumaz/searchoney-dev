["04:08,140","04:10,140","\"Alright then.\""]
["04:10,140","04:12,980","\"Let's go.\""]
["04:12,980","04:14,380","\"I think I should voice Sonic.\""]
["04:14,380","04:15,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:15,380","04:16,380","\"Do it.\""]
["04:16,380","04:17,380","\"Alright.\""]
["04:17,380","04:20,740","\"If you're sorry.\""]
["04:20,740","04:23,220","\"Why don't they use Jiliole White anywhere?\""]
["04:23,220","04:24,220","\"Ooh.\""]
["04:24,220","04:27,220","\"That is some snazzy animation.\""]
["04:27,220","04:28,220","\"Hot dog.\""]
["04:28,220","04:29,220","\"How did they do that?\""]
["04:29,220","04:31,380","\"I'm legitimately impressed.\""]
["04:31,380","04:32,380","\"This is a fan game?\""]
["04:32,380","04:34,700","\"This is a better fucking game than any...\""]
["04:34,700","04:35,700","\"I don't know if they've ever done it.\""]
["04:35,700","04:36,700","\"You don't know that yet.\""]
["04:36,700","04:37,900","\"We haven't gotten in.\""]
["04:37,900","04:38,900","\"It's true.\""]
["04:38,900","04:41,300","\"It just looks insanely impressive so far.\""]
["04:41,300","04:42,300","\"Holy...\""]
["04:42,300","04:43,300","\"Oh, wow.\""]
["04:43,300","04:44,300","\"Hey, let me play.\""]
["04:44,300","04:45,300","\"Hey, don't reveal how insanely impressive you are.\""]
["04:45,300","04:46,300","\"It's done.\""]
["04:46,300","04:47,300","\"It's a start game.\""]
["04:47,300","04:48,300","\"The following...\""]
["04:48,300","04:49,300","\"Don't say!\""]
["04:49,300","04:50,300","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["04:50,300","04:51,300","\"Should I not?\""]
["04:51,300","04:52,300","\"No, it's just what it said.\""]
["04:52,300","04:55,300","\"Oh, I can choose sonic entails or sonic entails or knuckles.\""]
["04:55,300","04:58,260","\"What about sonic and knuckles or tails and knuckles?\""]
["04:58,260","05:01,180","\"They're trying to do it very traditional because in Sonic 3 you could\""]
["05:01,180","05:04,940","\"have Sonic and Tails like Sonic 2. What does that mean? Does it just switch back\""]
["05:04,940","05:09,500","\"and forth between them? I'll do Sonic and Tails. It feels more like I've got my friend.\""]
["05:09,500","05:16,380","\"Oh this is really holy. This is really nice looking. It controls perfect too.\""]
["05:16,380","05:20,620","\"No way. How do I jump? How do I bump?\""]
["05:20,620","05:27,740","\"No it's right bumper. I don't I don't know how to communicate how impressed I am at how this looks.\""]
["05:27,740","05:36,940","\"I know right. Hey stop. I don't even like Sonic. I do. I like Sonic, but this is a this has been\""]
["05:36,940","05:42,300","\"development since 1898. Can you believe it? This looks more real than actual Sonic games.\""]
["05:42,300","05:47,740","\"More real? Yeah, like this looks more like a Sonic game than like a venture or Sonic 06.\""]
["05:47,740","05:49,180","\"Because it's trying to.\""]
["05:49,180","05:50,140","\"Or shadow the headshot.\""]
["05:50,140","05:53,100","\"Trying to stay true to the original material and everything.\""]
["05:53,100","05:55,660","\"Can you do the light dash? Can he follow a trail?\""]
["05:55,660","06:01,740","\"I'm not sure what yeah, what do you know in the last time I played this was whoa when I was still in school\""]
["06:01,740","06:07,700","\"You played this like grade school or what when I was I think I was in middle school when I played this last\""]
["06:07,700","06:13,800","\"So this has been development for ages and seeing how far it's come is really really really impressive\""]
["06:13,800","06:18,560","\"Just all the effort that went into it. So how long until second. Oh, that's awesome\""]
["06:18,560","06:23,020","\"Decent to see some dissists second doesn't seem to be stingy about that anymore the last time\""]
["06:23,020","06:28,360","\"I remember them caring about that kind of thing was a streets of rage remake or whatever is called which was too bad\""]
["06:28,360","06:31,220","\"That was really a shame, but didn't they hire those guys?\""]
["06:31,220","06:38,980","\"I I think Sega has really loosened up and that's good. They're cool about fan games. I like these little scrubbing bubbles robots\""]
["06:38,980","06:41,860","\"This is really cool. Holy shit\""]
["06:41,860","06:46,820","\"They have the option to even toggle the 3d models if you want to although I prefer these. Yeah\""]
["06:48,020","06:49,020","\"That's way nicer.\""]
["06:49,020","06:50,720","\"They look really nice.\""]
["06:50,720","06:53,080","\"There's so much effort poured into this.\""]
["06:53,080","06:54,080","\"It's crazy.\""]
["06:54,080","06:58,000","\"How many frames of animation is this already?\""]
["06:58,000","07:00,000","\"I mean they had to do it for every single angle.\""]
["07:00,000","07:02,800","\"They have to have an idle animation from every angle.\""]
["07:02,800","07:08,200","\"The last time I played it, Knuckles wasn't done and they had weird photos of him and Sonic\""]
["07:08,200","07:09,200","\"Adventure.\""]
["07:09,200","07:10,200","\"Really?\""]
["07:10,200","07:11,200","\"A limited palette.\""]
["07:11,200","07:12,200","\"That's funny.\""]
["07:12,200","07:13,200","\"They were still working on all the assets.\""]
["07:13,200","07:14,200","\"Oh my god.\""]
["07:14,200","07:16,200","\"That's why it's crazy to see this all done too because oh my god.\""]
["07:16,200","07:17,200","\"So this is done.\""]
["07:17,200","07:23,280","\"I don't know if it's like final version okay, but it's insanely polished up after all the years now\""]
["07:23,280","07:25,280","\"Did you say this was uh\""]
["07:25,280","07:32,800","\"Yeah, this is off of a specific doom engine. I forget which one it is even just the frame rate like it's not slowing down or anything\""]
["07:32,800","07:39,960","\"Ah fuck be careful with it. Oh, there we go. Sonic is capable of incredible\""]
["07:39,960","07:41,960","\"power feats\""]
["07:41,960","07:46,340","\"Okay, so is that a lock on or is it just to go fast kind of I think you lock down enemies in front of you\""]
["07:46,340","07:48,340","\"I did it. Oh\""]
["07:48,340","07:51,300","\"Wow\""]
["07:51,300","07:57,760","\"I remember that MIDI so what is the fault? What is the through line between this and the old version?\""]
["07:57,760","08:03,840","\"Much more polished visually, but like what do they have a little bit better? What do they have in common?\""]
["08:03,840","08:06,040","\"What do you mean share the same name? Oh?\""]
["08:06,760","08:12,560","\"I'm very confused now. Do you mean compared to RoboBLAST 1? Yeah? Oh, I thought you meant like older versions of it.\""]
["08:12,560","08:14,860","\"It seems like it's just a continued story. Yeah, it's just a continued thing.\""]
["08:14,860","08:18,160","\"They should honestly not... they shouldn't call it RoboBLAST 2.\""]
["08:18,160","08:22,960","\"Just think of it. I kind of appreciated just because they're recognizing they started with a click of click.\""]
["08:22,960","08:24,460","\"Yeah, I would rather this from the end of the video.\""]
["08:24,460","08:27,660","\"Treat the basic old one as Canon.\""]
["08:27,660","08:31,660","\"That's still so crazy to me that they stuck with this for all this time.\""]
["08:31,660","08:34,460","\"And they ended up with such an amazing result thanks to it.\""]
["08:34,460","08:37,460","\"seeing them grow up as they're making these games.\""]
["08:37,460","08:38,800","\"- Are they all 50 now?\""]
["08:38,800","08:40,740","\"- I wonder, I don't know.\""]
["08:40,740","08:41,580","\"- I would know.\""]
["08:41,580","08:44,240","\"- What was it, Sonic Team Jr.?\""]
["08:44,240","08:45,080","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:45,080","08:47,140","\"I don't know the full extent, but uh...\""]
["08:47,140","08:48,660","\"- That's cute, they kept that.\""]
["08:48,660","08:49,820","\"You can go in my guess, dude.\""]
["08:49,820","08:51,620","\"- I remember playing Sonic Robo Blast one\""]
["08:51,620","08:53,100","\"when I was younger just because I played a lot\""]
["08:53,100","08:54,780","\"of those click and play fan games.\""]
["08:54,780","08:57,260","\"So getting to see this was already amazing back then\""]
["08:57,260","08:59,660","\"and seeing where it's ended up,\""]
["08:59,660","09:02,300","\"I just can't believe it, but it came this far.\""]
["09:02,300","09:03,140","\"- Ah, fuy.\""]
["09:03,140","09:04,060","\"- This part seems kinda tricky.\""]
["09:04,060","09:05,060","\"You can do it Chris.\""]
["09:05,060","09:06,060","\"And that's annoying.\""]
["09:06,060","09:07,060","\"There you go.\""]
["09:07,060","09:08,060","\"There you go.\""]
["09:08,060","09:09,060","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:09,060","09:10,060","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["09:10,060","09:11,060","\"Fancy.\""]
["09:11,060","09:15,560","\"By the way, 3D Sonic can be fun.\""]
["09:15,560","09:19,060","\"I remember this song because uh...\""]
["09:19,060","09:20,060","\"Get in.\""]
["09:20,060","09:21,060","\"Get up.\""]
["09:21,060","09:22,060","\"Get up here.\""]
["09:22,060","09:24,660","\"Oh no, this is like a crazy flashback for me now.\""]
["09:24,660","09:28,060","\"Getting to see where it's gone since I was younger.\""]
["09:28,060","09:29,060","\"Okay, Sonic.\""]
["09:29,060","09:32,060","\"They have better versions of these songs now, which is cool.\""]
["09:32,060","09:34,260","\"I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here.\""]
["09:34,260","09:35,180","\"- They've been going--\""]
["09:35,180","09:36,580","\"- The running fast.\""]
["09:36,580","09:37,780","\"- It's just the wrong way.\""]
["09:37,780","09:39,380","\"- Yeah, I think he turned around completely.\""]
["09:39,380","09:40,220","\"- Did he?\""]
["09:40,220","09:41,060","\"- Yeah, why aren't you just supposed\""]
["09:41,060","09:42,180","\"to keep proceeding through there?\""]
["09:42,180","09:43,100","\"- I'm trying.\""]
["09:43,100","09:44,780","\"I don't know how to get up.\""]
["09:44,780","09:45,620","\"Obviously-- - Oh, jeez!\""]
["09:45,620","09:46,460","\"- Oh, up there there's a ramp.\""]
["09:46,460","09:48,140","\"- Okay, okay, okay, okay, there we go.\""]
["09:48,140","09:49,340","\"See?\""]
["09:49,340","09:50,980","\"There we go, okay.\""]
["09:50,980","09:51,820","\"- We're guiding you.\""]
["09:51,820","09:53,140","\"- Oh, okay.\""]
["09:53,140","09:53,980","\"- Careful, Tails.\""]
["09:53,980","09:55,420","\"- You gotta be careful.\""]
["09:55,420","09:56,820","\"I wonder if it still does it.\""]
["09:56,820","09:58,460","\"I remember the way these maps used to work\""]
["09:58,460","10:00,020","\"is that you had to double up the walls\""]
["10:00,020","10:02,420","\"because since Sonic went so fast,\""]
["10:02,420","10:04,020","\"he could potentially clip through the walls.\""]
["10:04,020","10:04,860","\"- Oh really?\""]
["10:04,860","10:05,900","\"- But I think they might have fixed that\""]
["10:05,900","10:06,900","\"as time has gone on here.\""]
["10:06,900","10:07,740","\"They've modified this.\""]
["10:07,740","10:09,380","\"- It doesn't seem very buggy.\""]
["10:09,380","10:10,740","\"It seems like it's ruined.\""]
["10:10,740","10:11,580","\"- Oh wow.\""]
["10:11,580","10:12,420","\"- Son of a bitch.\""]
["10:12,420","10:13,260","\"- You could have seen that coming.\""]
["10:13,260","10:15,140","\"- There's a lot they can get out of this now\""]
["10:15,140","10:16,540","\"compared to back then.\""]

["10:18,140","10:19,500","\"- You got all these slopes?\""]
["10:19,500","10:21,380","\"- He's going really fucking fast.\""]
["10:21,380","10:22,220","\"- He is.\""]
["10:22,220","10:23,540","\"He goes very fast in this game.\""]
["10:23,540","10:24,540","\"- So it's Sonic do.\""]
["10:24,540","10:25,380","\"It's true.\""]
["10:25,380","10:26,420","\"- You little fucking bitch.\""]
["10:26,420","10:27,340","\"- But hey, guess what?\""]
["10:27,340","10:29,340","\"Doom, you also ran pretty fast in that.\""]
["10:29,340","10:30,940","\"So it's kind of a fitting thing here.\""]
["10:30,940","10:31,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:31,780","10:35,500","\"Oh man, this is so cool.\""]
["10:35,500","10:37,260","\"I know, it's just, I'm just like,\""]
["10:37,260","10:40,460","\"oh, why did they not buy this and put it on stuff?\""]
["10:40,460","10:44,620","\"Sega, you stupid.\""]
["10:44,620","10:45,460","\"Buy this.\""]

["10:47,140","10:49,100","\"Let me make your decision.\""]
["10:49,100","10:50,260","\"Why would you not put this,\""]
["10:50,260","10:52,420","\"holy fuck, why would you not do this?\""]
["10:52,420","10:55,580","\"They're too busy saying Sonic is bad\""]
["10:55,580","10:56,580","\"on their social media.\""]
["10:56,580","10:58,980","\"Yeah, that's a really funny fucking joke, isn't it?\""]
["10:58,980","11:04,700","\"No one's ever fucking said that before I I feel like they haven't done it as much lately, but that was the thing\""]
["11:04,700","11:10,740","\"It was yes, I remember people were so aware that makes us like I was just pretending to be well\""]
["11:10,740","11:13,860","\"It's just like don't don't say you suck over and over again\""]
["11:13,860","11:20,820","\"Being like oh I know I'm a bad person that means I don't have to improve it's also really disrespectful to all the people who actually worked\""]
["11:20,820","11:22,820","\"It really hurt on it people who are fans\""]
["11:22,820","11:26,280","\"and that too to the fans but like\""]
["11:28,140","11:31,740","\"Mania at least was really good, although Mania was a bit of a fluke. They were...\""]
["11:31,740","11:35,020","\"- And because it was also fan game stuff. - Game fucking...\""]
["11:35,020","11:38,860","\"- Oh, sure. - They were putting everything down on forces.\""]
["11:38,860","11:40,540","\"They were hoping that was gonna be the big success.\""]
["11:40,540","11:43,740","\"Mania was kind of unexpected to be the success.\""]
["11:43,740","11:46,380","\"But of course, it turned out great, because fans worked on it, yeah.\""]
["11:46,380","11:49,020","\"I figured that would have been safe that you could jump over the laser.\""]
["11:49,020","11:54,300","\"Sonic fans are crazy passionate, and they can make really high quality stuff.\""]
["11:54,300","11:57,820","\"It's 'cause he's just so likable, any... Look at this little guy, look at that.\""]
["11:57,820","11:59,820","\"I think it works best when he's in this world\""]
["11:59,820","12:05,060","\"When it's like it shoot him whoa you can look around when it's abstract and cartoony\""]
["12:05,060","12:07,420","\"I think that's when Sonic works you can go into doom mode\""]
["12:07,420","12:10,220","\"This is insane\""]
["12:10,220","12:16,820","\"Look at these dancing flowers. Oh, okay. You're saving screen shots. Thank you. I'm I really yeah\""]
["12:16,820","12:19,260","\"You just did it repeated. Yep. You're still doing it. Oh\""]
["12:19,260","12:23,740","\"It's good to be back make a gift out of them and play it on screen right now\""]
["12:23,740","12:26,060","\"Whoa\""]
["12:26,060","12:28,060","\"They even got that\""]
["12:28,060","12:31,220","\"The last thing he ever saw\""]
["12:31,220","12:39,340","\"This is so freaking cool also the music it's fucking yeah, no the music's really good and it's super fitting to\""]
["12:39,340","12:46,840","\"Like this one specifically how it sounds it reminds me of like the OVA the sonic OVA just around that time period\""]
["12:46,840","12:48,140","\"Oh my god, you're right\""]
["12:48,140","12:50,140","\"Yeah, I can feel it\""]
["12:50,140","12:54,460","\"We've watched that a couple of times. I love that the door. He's like strange\""]
["12:54,980","13:00,660","\"Yeah, we have that VHS. I I had that as a kid. I wish I had at least kid. I would have loved it\""]
["13:00,660","13:05,660","\"I liked it a lot. I remember as a kid. It doesn't obviously like hold up too strongly now\""]
["13:05,660","13:12,380","\"She's a good character she's a lot of fun\""]
["13:12,380","13:20,540","\"But yeah, that was originally like a little OVA and I would imagine that was probably like a pitch for a show or something\""]
["13:20,540","13:23,220","\"Oh, it would have worked. I think it was fun. Oh\""]
["13:24,300","13:30,100","\"You float on this had a decent soundtrack. It was nicely animated at points. It's using his CD design\""]
["13:30,100","13:32,100","\"Which I think is his best one\""]
["13:32,100","13:38,640","\"I this is an interesting area. It sure is isn't it? I've been looking forward to you know every game has got to open on\""]
["13:38,640","13:41,200","\"Green Hill Zone. I've been looking forward to like okay. What's there?\""]
["13:41,200","13:49,520","\"Really interesting ideas with some of these stages. I mean is this a shield what's happening here? Yeah, I think that's a shield\""]
["13:50,460","13:56,360","\"No, this is so crazy to see too because I do remember the stage like the early version of this map when I was younger\""]
["13:56,360","14:00,380","\"It was a lot harder to navigate. It looks like they cleaned it up a lot more\""]
["14:00,380","14:08,420","\"School you just have tails fall you're around to yeah, the options there. I wonder is uh is co-op\""]
["14:08,420","14:10,940","\"I think it is possible actually no you can do co-op\""]
["14:10,940","14:15,320","\"This is the perfect game. It might be land co-op. I'm not sure if you can do split screen\""]
["14:15,320","14:19,280","\"I should look into it well because yeah, they've done a lot since I first played it\""]
["14:19,280","14:21,520","\"I was really young when I first played this\""]
["14:21,520","14:25,160","\"Scary this is fun\""]
["14:25,160","14:31,760","\"This is the exact kind of freaking game I like also that perspective when you just made that jump and made it feel that much better\""]
["14:31,760","14:37,760","\"Just because you could see how much was ahead of you and how fast you were going. Yeah, it feels very very good\""]
["14:37,760","14:41,380","\"All right, leave me loud and watch out for the Rob's oh fuck\""]
["14:41,380","14:44,280","\"Decent enemy designs here too\""]
["14:44,280","14:46,440","\"everything feels real it feels like\""]
["14:47,120","14:49,280","\"Like official I know what you mean\""]
["14:49,280","14:54,640","\"If second was really putting a lot of effort at the time to making a PC\""]
["14:54,640","14:57,400","\"Sona game they probably would have ended up like something like this\""]
["14:57,400","15:03,320","\"But now with this much polish obviously this much polish is possible through years and years and years of hard work and fans\""]
["15:03,320","15:06,800","\"Just really sticking to it. So has this really been worked on for like how long?\""]
["15:06,800","15:09,480","\"1998 I think it's really started\""]
["15:09,480","15:14,640","\"It was really really really old like I said I was growing up at the time when I was first playing this\""]
["15:15,080","15:17,080","\"So it's crazy to see where it's gone\""]
["15:17,080","15:22,480","\"And I'm glad there's still so much support around in everything too, especially after a lot of these recent builds\""]
["15:22,480","15:29,760","\"I love that fire effect. Do you think oddity will be the same way without a date? That's the the mother for thing\""]
["15:29,760","15:34,120","\"Do you think we're gonna be like 40 or 50?\""]
["15:34,120","15:38,800","\"Remember when they said they were gonna release it this summer\""]
["15:38,800","15:40,480","\"I wonder what that one's gonna be like\""]
["15:40,480","15:45,240","\"I don't mind people like putting a lot of effort in for something like that if you get an insane\""]
["15:45,240","15:47,240","\"How wide was you? Yeah, cuz uh\""]
["15:47,240","15:55,120","\"Well like I said, this is still just crazy to take in that this is how far it's come. Oh, I remember this part\""]
["15:55,120","15:57,840","\"fun\""]
["15:57,840","15:59,840","\"This is clever\""]
["15:59,840","16:03,600","\"Hey, I did like that\""]
["16:03,600","16:07,040","\"I wonder if it still has that boss in this because speaking of the OVA\""]
["16:07,040","16:11,560","\"I remember they had the the one robot from it and this is a boss at one point\""]
["16:11,560","16:16,280","\"Oh, the other leg the the one that he has to fight in the city. Yeah, the one they fights in the city\""]
["16:16,280","16:19,720","\"Wow, so there's a lot of love in here too for Sonic fans\""]
["16:19,720","16:23,260","\"Specifically fear a sonic fan around 1998\""]
["16:23,260","16:30,260","\"Yeah, I only ever had one as a kid and then I my next Sonic game was adventure - battle so I missed out on all of the in-between ones\""]
["16:30,260","16:37,000","\"It's always interesting to hear about it now as a franchise - because it doesn't seem to be a thing where people really knew\""]
["16:37,000","16:41,000","\"where it was at or like what the appeal was because to me the appeal of Sonic was always like the\""]
["16:41,000","16:45,480","\"physics the speed. I mean I think that's the problem is that Sega doesn't know what the appeal of\""]
["16:45,480","16:50,600","\"Sonic is. No it doesn't seem like a lot of the audience does either so it's all over the place\""]
["16:50,600","16:55,560","\"from like every angle. Yeah it's hard for anyone to figure out what to really do. That was interesting\""]
["16:55,560","17:02,280","\"but that's what's cool about this is they still try to maintain a bit of like sonic-style physics\""]
["17:02,280","17:06,960","\"their slopes and everything in here, but there's also a lot of just stage design really\""]
["17:06,960","17:08,640","\"functioning around speed.\""]
["17:08,640","17:13,320","\"The momentum feels way better too, because it doesn't take so long to slow down.\""]
["17:13,320","17:17,640","\"Yeah, you accelerate pretty quick in this.\""]
["17:17,640","17:19,640","\"They got a little admin rate.\""]
["17:19,640","17:20,880","\"You can accelerate pretty quickly too.\""]
["17:20,880","17:25,600","\"I mean, yeah, you're not super slippery, which is good because this would be a lot harder.\""]
["17:25,600","17:29,680","\"I feel like it might have been a little bit slippery when I played it last, but it looks\""]
["17:29,680","17:32,000","\"like they tightened it up more, which is nice.\""]
["17:32,000","17:34,440","\"They tightened up the graphics on level three\""]
["17:34,440","17:36,040","\"with their controller in hand.\""]
["17:36,040","17:37,300","\"- What doing, oh, okay.\""]
["17:37,300","17:39,120","\"- Whoa!\""]
["17:39,120","17:40,840","\"- Chris, did you ever see those commercials?\""]
["17:40,840","17:41,680","\"- I'm sure he did.\""]
["17:41,680","17:42,520","\"- The what?\""]
["17:42,520","17:43,840","\"- The game design college or whatever.\""]
["17:43,840","17:44,680","\"- No.\""]
["17:44,680","17:46,640","\"- It was a really old ad and it's two guys pretending\""]
["17:46,640","17:50,520","\"to play a game and their boss comes in and says,\""]
["17:50,520","17:52,320","\"\"\"Hey, I need you guys to get on this.\"\"\""]
["17:52,320","17:54,320","\"And they go, \"\"Oh yeah, we're just tightening up\""]
["17:54,320","17:56,320","\"\"\"the graphics of level three.\"\"\""]
["17:56,320","17:57,160","\"(laughing)\""]
["17:57,160","17:58,000","\"And what is it?\""]
["17:58,000","17:58,840","\"He turns the other one and says,\""]
["17:58,840","18:01,240","\"\"\"I can't believe we get paid to do this.\"\"\""]
["18:01,240","18:08,700","\"Oh, so shit. It's just them looking cool holding controllers playing a video game. That's what it's like making a game guys\""]
["18:08,700","18:11,120","\"Not agonizing pain whatsoever\""]
["18:11,120","18:14,160","\"It's not the most soul crushing annoying\""]
["18:14,160","18:20,360","\"Unthankful job ever no since you've done both of your experiences seem to be negative\""]
["18:20,360","18:24,800","\"What I'm not enjoy working on games. No, I mean that what I was gonna ask Chris enjoy working on it\""]
["18:24,800","18:30,440","\"I don't enjoy people thinking that it's easy that it's fun. Oh, well, that's just your exposure to the gaming world\""]
["18:30,440","18:37,660","\"That's what it is Chris would you say that being an animator or making games is is like more unpleasant?\""]
["18:37,660","18:42,100","\"Since you've done both making games cuz\""]
["18:42,100","18:46,240","\"Little tiny things can take so long and most people don't\""]
["18:46,240","18:53,840","\"I would say that's the biggest thing with games is that there's a lack of an understanding of all kind of work goes into it\""]
["18:53,840","18:57,360","\"Sometimes I think you're supposed to go under water. Yeah, I gotta jump off this box. I\""]
["18:59,440","19:02,560","\"Can do this oh there you go. Yeah, I'll do it. Hey\""]
