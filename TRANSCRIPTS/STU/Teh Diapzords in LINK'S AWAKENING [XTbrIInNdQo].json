["06:14,880","06:19,160","\"I mean, is it safe to say that Minecraft made mining popular?\""]
["06:19,160","06:20,320","\"I think you're right.\""]
["06:20,320","06:23,840","\"People weren't doing it before until my graph like made it fun.\""]

["06:28,120","06:31,120","\"It was such a great name, even though it's like what every game is called.\""]
["06:31,120","06:35,340","\"It was also based off of an actual game that was like, it was like not Minecraft,\""]

["06:43,760","06:47,580","\"Tomer, we should get you to read out the entirety of Minekopf and then no one can yell at us.\""]
["06:47,580","06:48,760","\"I don't want to do that.\""]
["06:48,760","06:50,840","\"Why not?\""]
["06:50,840","06:52,960","\"For some reason, I have reservations.\""]
["06:52,960","06:58,160","\"Some reason that just doesn't sit right with the be have you guys ever gone mining mine?\""]
["06:58,160","07:00,720","\"Comfy mining not mine.\""]

["07:10,360","07:15,080","\"I don't want to either sounds like back breaking labor like literally.\""]
["07:15,080","07:19,840","\"I mean to be fair that was like ages ago, but I still wouldn't want to go like spelunking.\""]
["07:19,840","07:23,880","\"Tell me what's worse for you backbreaking labor or sitting around like watching anime\""]
["07:23,880","07:27,720","\"Yeah, what's what's more what's more definitely sitting on watching?\""]

["07:36,000","07:40,000","\"I've only seen season one though, but season one was pretty solid from start to finish\""]
["07:40,000","07:43,440","\"It was kind of like the whole Rick and Morty thing. You can more season one is really good\""]
["07:43,440","07:48,960","\"So right I've only ever seen three episodes of Rick and Morty\""]
["07:48,960","07:53,820","\"Well I hope they were all in season one because that's where they were and there was fine peak\""]

["08:12,440","08:15,080","\"Jesus\""]
["08:15,080","08:21,560","\"You are you just supposed to wait or you're supposed to hit it? I don't know. What's he gonna explode? I don't think it is there\""]
["08:21,560","08:22,440","\"I\""]
["08:22,440","08:25,860","\"Think you kept bouncing it so stuck in its animation\""]
["08:25,860","08:31,400","\"I think one of these is like well like fill my bombs. Whoa. Yeah, it's ten bombs\""]
["08:31,400","08:38,000","\"There's a lot of dungeons now. I think I could take on those little there's a severe lack of coffee and paste in this game\""]
["08:38,000","08:43,220","\"I miss when dungeons were just putting a ball in a room and then go into the next room and getting your prize\""]
["08:43,220","08:46,620","\"Oh my god, oh my gosh. Yeah, that's crazy. I\""]
["08:46,620","08:50,300","\"Remember anything in ages or seasons being that crazy\""]
["08:50,300","08:52,340","\"Oh\""]
["08:52,340","08:55,980","\"I hate dungeons like this where it requires you to use your brain a little bit\""]
["08:55,980","09:00,660","\"I like when dungeons just like they're like what is missing and it's a block and you put it there and then it\""]
["09:00,660","09:03,660","\"And then you claim your prize\""]
["09:03,660","09:11,220","\"Copy and paste that 500 times it's targeted like six year old yeah, and when it's they're like trying to use switch gimmicks\""]
["09:11,220","09:14,340","\"I think there's a fake wall on that side there too. Yeah, I went\""]
["09:14,340","09:22,820","\"I really ruffled some james with that with that like own but in reality like I've I spent about 90 hours on that game\""]
["09:22,820","09:25,320","\"Breath of the whizzy. Yeah, breath of the whatever\""]
["09:25,320","09:32,860","\"Breath of the wiki wiki wild west breath of the whatever and tears of the Nintendo Kingdom whatever the fuck they're releasing now\""]
["09:32,860","09:39,360","\"You check it out now. I can do this. Oh, nice. Oh shit. Don't forget actually. Oh, you can do that without the dancing jump and\""]
["09:40,860","09:43,660","\"Yeah, that's what I was trying to do do it from the other room\""]
["09:43,660","09:52,260","\"Watch it for the Grim Reaper do it from the other room like charge into there from the room you exploded. I don't think that's necessary\""]
["09:52,260","09:59,280","\"Yeah, that those things are more annoying. I know it's it's like they're super beneficial, but\""]
["09:59,280","10:04,600","\"They're so annoying to hear it wait for the animation. That is cool. That was great told me\""]
["10:04,600","10:09,060","\"But anyways, I don't know it like it was saying just one last thing\""]
["10:09,060","10:12,820","\"I swear there's a little bit of a lag. I know I'm sorry\""]
["10:12,820","10:16,340","\"You know in Zelda they got the stamina bar mm-hmm and in Zelda\""]
["10:16,340","10:20,160","\"It's kind of annoying but then in dark souls they have the stamina bar and it makes more sense\""]
["10:20,160","10:21,420","\"What is that?\""]
["10:21,420","10:26,060","\"Because you stamina for like climbing walls in Zelda and like if you're if you don't have enough stamina\""]
["10:26,060","10:31,440","\"You'll just fall off the cliff, but also I don't know if they use stamina when you fight in Zelda\""]
["10:31,440","10:35,140","\"I don't remember if you're when you're fighting guys in that game stamina in skyward sword as well\""]
["10:35,140","10:40,260","\"It has been a while. I'll have to play that with you at some point. We all should play it. I don't want to play that one\""]
["10:40,260","10:42,260","\"You don't play no interest\""]
["10:42,260","10:49,140","\"Sack loves that game skyward sword. No, he doesn't know breath of the whistle. Yeah breath of the way he loves breath the wild\""]
["10:49,140","10:51,940","\"That's like his favorite game. I don't want to play skyward sword\""]
["10:51,940","10:53,980","\"I'll play breath the world. I don't want to play skyward sword eater\""]
["10:53,980","10:59,100","\"I refuse to play $60 for a game that they never want to play toilet princess either\""]
["10:59,100","11:01,100","\"That was the most disappointing game I do not like\""]
["11:01,740","11:05,280","\"Yeah, let's just talk let's just punch down. This is just a punch downs out episode\""]
["11:05,280","11:11,920","\"I want to talk about Twilight Princess. I do not like that game. I think that's another Zelda game that it's boring and draw\""]
["11:11,920","11:16,260","\"Yeah, it overstays. It's welcome early on with the wolf stuff. I thought I'm sure\""]
["11:16,260","11:20,340","\"Troll meant boring like rule like your falls you fall asleep\""]
["11:20,340","11:25,900","\"I thought drill meant like like mildly entertaining, but it was usually used sarcastically. Oh like how draw\""]
["11:25,900","11:29,980","\"How draw? Yeah, you're right. Yeah drab. I mean it is boring\""]
["11:30,620","11:37,420","\"entertaining the problem is Twilight Princess becomes good, but it's like later half of the game the early half is so\""]
["11:37,420","11:39,060","\"Unbelievably boring\""]
["11:39,060","11:45,340","\"Like it's not even worth playing. I mean it is probably worth playing, you know not to be too rude, but I genuinely think\""]
["11:45,340","11:47,380","\"that\""]
["11:47,380","11:51,300","\"The early half of it is is bad for me my favorites all the games\""]
["11:51,300","11:54,060","\"Say it with me my joy is math\""]
["11:55,820","11:59,040","\"Waco, but not but the link to the past\""]
["11:59,040","12:04,060","\"And that's probably it was probably the one I still need to learn to play\""]
["12:04,060","12:10,660","\"Right this way pretty good to really rush, but it still feels like way more soulful than a a win-waker win-waker\""]
["12:10,660","12:17,680","\"When we I hate that win-waker has such massive problems, but it's those are still outweighed by like I feel like it's big\""]
["12:17,680","12:21,040","\"It's a lot of charming is I feel like it's biggest flaws how they handle the\""]
["12:21,700","12:28,020","\"The triforce pieces at the end that sucks for everybody likes that even that got they sort of fixed that they did fix the\""]
["12:28,020","12:30,100","\"Remains only made you collect like three I think\""]
["12:30,100","12:35,580","\"Which makes sense right you collect the three no no instead of collecting fragments\""]
["12:35,580","12:40,820","\"Yeah, like seven fragments and nobody wants to do plus like you have to pay the piper's you have to pay the fucking\""]
["12:40,820","12:46,100","\"Whatever his name is a little fairy guy tingle tingle you pay him oh\""]
["12:46,100","12:51,020","\"Like it when he like grabs his bulge he goes oh\""]
["12:51,020","12:56,780","\"Yeah, anyways, I promise I I'm a fan of Zelda. I'm just critical of it. I guess\""]
