["00:30,820","00:33,400","\"Elephant in the room. Okay. Zack's dead.\""]
["00:33,400","00:37,780","\"Yeah, he passed away last night, but don't worry. He'll be back soon.\""]
["00:37,780","00:40,540","\"In the afterlife.\""]
["00:40,540","00:43,740","\"We planted him in the ground and then you one will grow in its place.\""]
["00:43,740","00:46,540","\"So you don't have to worry about none of that.\""]
["00:46,540","00:51,540","\"What is this really going to play through Super Mario 3D?\""]
["00:51,540","00:56,980","\"Watch. This is the only instance of plumbing in the entire Mario cannon.\""]
["00:57,180","01:00,060","\"Is it really? I don't know. It's the only one I can think of.\""]
["01:00,060","01:02,340","\"Yeah, they actually friggin fix a pipe.\""]
["01:02,340","01:06,980","\"Is the only reason he's a plumber because they put the pipes on the ground and they were like,\""]
["01:06,980","01:08,740","\"\"\"Ah, that's why.\"\"\""]
["01:08,740","01:09,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:09,180","01:10,860","\"Okay.\""]
["01:10,860","01:15,820","\"Kind of feels like it's one of those things that the guys that wrote the like manual came up with.\""]
["01:15,820","01:17,220","\"Yeah, probably.\""]
["01:17,220","01:19,180","\"And he was a genius.\""]
["01:19,180","01:21,340","\"He was really ahead of his time.\""]
["01:21,340","01:26,900","\"Although I think that they said Mario is not a plumber anymore and his relationship with Peach is purely platonic.\""]
["01:26,900","01:34,860","\"That I'm not playing anymore. Is this specifically Bowser's fury we're playing or is this this is not a regular 3d world\""]
["01:34,860","01:39,660","\"This is Bowser before he's pissed off. This is his origin story of getting mad at you\""]
["01:39,660","01:43,240","\"This is Bowser when he was still in therapy\""]
["01:43,240","01:48,340","\"Bowser's really working on himself. Yeah, they just went spelunking\""]
["01:48,340","01:51,100","\"Yeah, and the Bowser's wicked hole\""]
["01:51,100","01:54,100","\"He's gonna be fucking sprigging at the end of that\""]
["01:56,020","01:59,300","\"Right up is isn't that what happens in Mario and Luigi's?\""]
["01:59,300","02:05,220","\"Yeah, the big the Bowser's inside story or whatever is called\""]
["02:05,220","02:08,840","\"He's on the toilet and they come up through his pipes and then you know\""]
["02:08,840","02:15,700","\"Hilarity ensues. All right guys. I'm gonna say it. Why don't we just run past all this stuff go straight to the castle?\""]
["02:15,700","02:22,020","\"You like how Lyle and I are doing such a great job evenly following you in a perfect line. Yeah, what's happening?\""]
["02:22,900","02:28,500","\"You're just in control. I was joking. This is just what happens when you run the channel, man people follow you without question\""]
["02:28,500","02:32,440","\"Wait, wait. This is a funny observation. Why can't we just simply jump across this?\""]
["02:32,440","02:36,300","\"You can jump in the screen. Okay, let's try that\""]
["02:36,300","02:41,200","\"All right, this game's shit. Okay. It's this bullball. Okay. Now go figure\""]
["02:41,200","02:47,440","\"Not good. It's just a silly joke. It's just silly the super bell end\""]
["02:50,220","02:52,220","\"Editor you know what to do\""]
["02:52,220","03:00,620","\"So we get all of our Mario 64 moves I think I think you can do like your I can't figure out how to\""]
["03:00,620","03:04,220","\"Ground stop. It's try the shoulder button\""]
["03:04,220","03:10,300","\"Mario's back and better than ever. Oh, okay. Yeah, it is that\""]
["03:10,300","03:13,820","\"Like Mario\""]
["03:13,820","03:16,460","\"Oh Marvie, I\""]
["03:18,220","03:23,980","\"Never played this one. He's always told me really doesn't he just looks like a oh go on then say it\""]
["03:23,980","03:29,540","\"I don't know. He doesn't look like a cat. Say you're slur go on. Just a shoot your slur, man\""]
["03:29,540","03:31,540","\"You only got one chance\""]
["03:31,540","03:35,100","\"What slur he really looks like a go on say it\""]
["03:35,100","03:40,020","\"It's like Eminem always said if you only had one slur would you make accounts?\""]
["03:40,020","03:45,340","\"You only have one slur if mom only made you one meal\""]
["03:45,340","03:49,900","\"Do you know that's the origin of the origin of the origin of the one slayer from the lower\""]
["03:49,900","03:58,220","\"Said the one slayer that's why has all the time in the world and was stupid to roll them all\""]
["03:58,220","04:05,100","\"One slur for me. It actually was a slur. Yeah, that's a really good conspiracy theory\""]
["04:05,100","04:10,260","\"Yeah, we should do our own Lorax theory was the one slur\""]
["04:11,700","04:15,440","\"You know oh fuck this guy up. We all know what the one slur was\""]
["04:15,440","04:19,580","\"We're just afraid to say it. Okay. Wait what?\""]
["04:19,580","04:25,640","\"Where did I go? I'm just happening. Sorry didn't mean to take you to this horrible place, but now that we're here\""]
["04:25,640","04:32,940","\"Let's explore this model of a cervix. The stamp is ours. Why can't there be a Mario game that doesn't look like a\""]
["04:32,940","04:38,700","\"You know bullshit. Why can't there be like gross fungus all over the city and everyone's a dinosaur?\""]
["04:39,220","04:42,520","\"That would be kind of rad and then Mario could break his arm\""]
["04:42,520","04:48,160","\"Yeah halfway through it, and then okay, I guess I'm not be mobile pop me\""]
["04:48,160","04:52,820","\"Yes, usually I wouldn't abide by such horrible things\""]

["05:07,660","05:11,480","\"Probably a little more earnestly. I hope all of that pressure is not just on me\""]
["05:11,480","05:15,340","\"At least one eight-year-old said that before\""]
["05:15,340","05:21,360","\"I would hate the living this way you're gonna hate this\""]
["05:21,360","05:24,360","\"What a tune\""]

["05:51,700","05:58,620","\"Even if you if you look at their net income even though Mario's more popular Luigi totally makes bang\""]
["05:58,620","06:06,100","\"It's true. He always I was because he actually takes the time to go plumbing Mario's only like don't act like you weren't driving that\""]

["07:15,580","07:21,980","\"Literally what happened was he uploaded the video and then he took it down like within like a few hours\""]
["07:21,980","07:25,900","\"And I was like I have a feeling that he might take this down and I downloaded it\""]
["07:25,900","07:29,940","\"I forgot about it for like four years and it was just on my hard drive and then one day\""]
["07:29,940","07:31,980","\"I like I just stumbled upon it was like oh my god\""]
["07:31,980","07:37,660","\"How did you find his channel in the first place? Did he have a semi popular channel? It's a little bit too cringe. Oh\""]

["08:28,940","08:35,560","\"Like why not make be that A and B or do the exact same thing on my controller. How is that useful?\""]

["14:29,840","14:32,840","\"I can do it, don't worry.\""]
["14:32,840","14:39,240","\"So I was thinking of wacky and quirky characters that could be played by Dan Cook circa 2010.\""]
["14:39,240","14:40,240","\"Yep.\""]
["14:40,240","14:42,640","\"And I thought of this one.\""]
["14:42,640","14:49,440","\"It's from a movie working title called The Shitcomer.\""]
["14:49,440","14:55,700","\"So the plot is Dan Cook is a guy who has a rare condition where he comes shit.\""]
["14:55,700","14:58,980","\"Okay, so he's the shit comer.\""]
["14:58,980","15:03,420","\"He only fucks girls in the ass so that when he comes he blames them.\""]
["15:03,420","15:07,000","\"Yeah, he can be like, \"\"Oh, you gave me poop noodle.\""]
["15:07,000","15:10,560","\"That's crazy.\"\"\""]
["15:10,560","15:15,560","\"But then he meets a girl that likes things a little freaky and falls in love.\""]
["15:15,560","15:16,560","\"Got it.\""]
["15:16,560","15:22,380","\"A girl from halfway through the movie that he had sex with earlier she comes back and it turns out he gave her a horrible\""]
["15:22,380","15:25,080","\"UTI shit's come okay\""]
["15:25,080","15:30,520","\"So think about that okay, but you're forgetting that the danko looks really fucking weird now\""]
["15:30,520","15:35,680","\"Yeah, but no this isn't 2010. Oh, we're going back. Yeah, we're going back in time\""]
["15:35,680","15:40,820","\"We're inventing a time machine just to make this movie. He'd be perfect for it. I don't want to talk to him\""]
["15:40,820","15:46,520","\"Wait who's controlling this? I think I am no all of it\""]
["15:46,520","15:49,440","\"Are is this a war for this what is this?\""]
["15:49,440","15:52,960","\"Affection all right all right\""]
["15:52,960","15:57,180","\"Don't worry. We jump. Oh, what the fuck we really are all doing it, huh?\""]
["15:57,180","16:01,400","\"Weird which way we go and we going under I?\""]
["16:01,400","16:09,680","\"Think basically it moves more efficiently when we're all in sync got it. We have to think with one mind gentlemen\""]
["16:09,680","16:14,960","\"Look at him go go up all right more fun. All right\""]
["16:14,960","16:20,760","\"Oh, holy look at that\""]
["16:20,760","16:31,140","\"My sheer force of will fuck no, let's hit that. Oh, that would have boosted us damn it\""]
["16:31,140","16:37,040","\"Whoever jumped there fucking come forward now. It was me. It was me. I'm sorry\""]
["16:37,040","16:39,440","\"I hate to be here now\""]

["16:53,600","17:01,360","\"jump. Don't jump. Don't jump? No. Oh, yeah, we do. Oh, no. That was so fucking my fault. I'm sorry.\""]
["17:01,360","17:10,080","\"Why is he so inflatable? I don't know. So maybe so you don't feel guilt for smashing his head\""]
["17:10,080","17:11,080","\"him like this.\""]
["17:11,080","17:12,080","\"Yeah.\""]

["17:22,080","17:27,880","\"Yeah, close enough.\""]
["17:27,880","17:31,440","\"In my game, the princess is called Princess Pink.\""]

["17:38,320","17:42,320","\"The main guy's called Man, Princess, Princess Pink.\""]
["17:42,320","17:43,960","\"Green Brothers called Green Brothers.\""]
["17:43,960","17:44,960","\"(laughing)\""]
["17:44,960","17:47,960","\"That would be horrible if your parents named you Green Brother.\""]

["17:48,960","17:50,440","\"I think it would be kinda cool.\""]
["17:50,440","17:53,440","\"You'd get away with anything.\""]

["17:56,840","17:59,160","\"Everyone would feel really bad for you all the time.\""]
["17:59,160","17:59,980","\"That's true.\""]
["17:59,980","18:00,800","\"Green Brother.\""]
["18:00,800","18:01,640","\"Oh, let's go gamble.\""]
["18:01,640","18:02,840","\"Yeah, let's definitely go there.\""]
["18:02,840","18:05,440","\"That was a reward for completing an optional level.\""]

["18:07,880","18:11,960","\"I like how you are now but a child and your instinct is to gamble.\""]
["18:11,960","18:14,840","\"You could win up to 777 coins.\""]
["18:14,840","18:15,360","\"Oh my crap.\""]
["18:15,360","18:16,760","\"You get a life for every fuck.\""]

["18:19,040","18:20,640","\"Oh, 200.\""]
["18:20,640","18:24,440","\"I feel like we could easily get all three to be the same at once.\""]

["18:36,920","18:40,920","\"Have you seen the Hobbit the Peter Jackson movie?\""]
["18:40,920","18:43,920","\"I've seen, I think we watched one at one point.\""]
["18:43,920","18:45,920","\"We don't have enough weed, one more star.\""]
["18:45,920","18:46,920","\"Yeah.\""]

["18:55,920","18:56,920","\"It's your friggin' star.\""]
["18:56,920","19:01,920","\"I think we actually do have to trace back to another level where we didn't get all the stars.\""]

["19:03,920","19:04,920","\"There we go.\""]
["19:04,920","19:08,400","\"But there's a scene in the Hobbit that reminded me of that guy with the helmet.\""]

["19:17,960","19:20,360","\"Is it inspirational? Did you cry?\""]
["19:20,360","19:24,760","\"No, it's really weird. It's like someone was like, \"\"You know what would be cool if a big...\""]
