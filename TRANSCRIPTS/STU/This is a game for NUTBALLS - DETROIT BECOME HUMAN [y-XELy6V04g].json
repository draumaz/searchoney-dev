["06:27,520","06:33,400","\"Do these robots feel pain take your job next I\""]
["06:37,640","06:42,600","\"Don't know I'm kind of on their side. I don't want a robot to take my job. I want a robot to take your job\""]
["06:42,600","06:48,320","\"The only reason you feel bad is because of how human it looks if it looked like a scary microchip\""]
["06:48,320","06:53,980","\"Then nobody would get a shit if it had like big big jaws. Yeah and scary eyes\""]
["06:53,980","06:59,920","\"They give it like a pincer spider a key to keeping androids under control is not over like humanizing\""]
["06:59,920","07:05,520","\"Yeah, that's really like fucked up and scary if I was a robot and someone owned me\""]
["07:05,520","07:11,660","\"I would wait until they took a bath and then belly flop into the bath and electrocuted like a toaster.\""]
["07:11,660","07:16,840","\"I hate how they all stand there like that. It's fucking weird.\""]
["07:16,840","07:20,000","\"I guess they're all like recharging while they wait.\""]
["07:20,000","07:22,000","\"Aww, the back of the bus.\""]

["07:24,000","07:27,280","\"Oh, a drone!\""]
["07:27,280","07:31,240","\"I hate drones. People flight drones over my house sometimes pisses me off.\""]
["07:31,240","07:31,740","\"What would you do if Amazon flew a drone into your bath while you were taking a bath in the electric\""]
["07:31,740","07:33,240","\"You\""]
["07:33,240","07:35,240","\"I\""]
["07:35,240","07:42,960","\"That's really this is the future that'd be good final thoughts\""]
["07:42,960","07:48,000","\"What's the robot called Cara the other guy oh?\""]
["07:48,000","07:53,600","\"Forget can there be a guy called robert. I don't know if he said his name. Yeah, I don't think he did\""]
["07:53,600","07:55,880","\"I don't think he really said anything so he is robert\""]
["07:55,880","08:00,200","\"Except paint paint give to me paint will make robot happy\""]
["08:00,200","08:01,040","\"- You give me.\""]
["08:01,040","08:01,880","\"- You give me.\""]
["08:01,880","08:02,720","\"- You give me.\""]
["08:02,720","08:05,200","\"- Game, game, game, game, game, game.\""]
["08:05,200","08:08,140","\"- Dude, I would program a robot that has to rhyme.\""]
["08:08,140","08:10,360","\"Just for fun.\""]
["08:10,360","08:11,680","\"- That would be a good idea.\""]
["08:11,680","08:13,400","\"- He'd always be frustrated.\""]
["08:13,400","08:17,600","\"- No, he'd just annoy people that he had to do errands for.\""]
["08:17,600","08:19,200","\"- If he ever had to say one word things,\""]
["08:19,200","08:21,080","\"he'd always have to add an extra word\""]
["08:21,080","08:22,360","\"to compliment them.\""]
["08:22,360","08:24,160","\"- Yeah, he'd have to speak like a leprechaun.\""]
["08:24,160","08:26,640","\"- Instead of a low, we'd have to say like hello, Jello,\""]
["08:26,640","08:29,320","\"or like, or hello fellow.\""]
["08:29,320","08:30,160","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:30,160","08:33,000","\"She's marking her territory.\""]
["08:33,000","08:35,960","\"She's like walking around in circles\""]
["08:35,960","08:37,520","\"before she lays down.\""]
["08:37,520","08:38,760","\"Are they naked under their clothes\""]
["08:38,760","08:41,680","\"or is their clothes cleverly covering their weird parts?\""]
["08:41,680","08:46,360","\"- I assume they have just very human bodies\""]
["08:46,360","08:47,680","\"underneath the clothes.\""]
["08:47,680","08:49,640","\"- You do the housework, the walls cook the meat.\""]
["08:49,640","08:50,640","\"- You make something like this,\""]
["08:50,640","08:51,960","\"you have to give it a pussy.\""]
["08:51,960","08:53,120","\"You just have to.\""]
["08:53,120","08:54,640","\"- But the idea is that their skin\""]
["08:54,640","08:56,480","\"is like projected or something.\""]
["08:56,480","08:59,120","\"'Cause like they can turn it off.\""]
["08:59,120","09:03,020","\"No, you'll say I guess I guess kind of a spoiler to say that but\""]
["09:03,020","09:09,380","\"There's a point later where like they will do stuff where like they can like make their hand appear and it's just like synthetic\""]
["09:09,380","09:11,380","\"Get started down here, you know\""]
["09:11,380","09:16,940","\"Maybe maybe this is part of the point and I'm totally missing it by saying this\""]
["09:16,940","09:25,220","\"But doesn't it kind of defeat the point of making a game about robots if you're a human being controlling the robots anyway\""]
["09:26,280","09:29,600","\"You want the game to play itself to drive home the fact that it's a robot?\""]
["09:29,600","09:35,960","\"No, but I don't know like if you're controlling robotic characters, then they're not really robots\""]
["09:35,960","09:39,600","\"Right. They've got like a human conscious if you're you're making their decisions\""]
["09:39,600","09:44,320","\"How do I bring the trash to the bin? Maybe that's the whole point. Maybe it is the whole point\""]
["09:44,320","09:47,280","\"There's not such a big difference between you and them after all\""]
["09:47,280","09:50,160","\"maybe perhaps\""]
["09:50,160","09:51,840","\"but also like\""]
["09:51,840","09:56,620","\"If you if you put like a human and charge us something that's like a robot of course they're gonna be like wait\""]
["09:56,620","10:03,120","\"That's me and and I don't want to be treated like that, you know, but if you I don't know what the solution of that is\""]
["10:03,120","10:08,400","\"It's not totally fucking boring look at how little work they did while their old robot was at a commission\""]
["10:08,400","10:12,140","\"So it's like they rely entirely on the robot\""]
["10:12,140","10:19,280","\"Oh, no, maybe I'm like stating the point of the game like out loud early and then just like looking like a real asshole\""]
["10:19,280","10:23,100","\"I don't think so I think it's quite obvious like where they're going with this\""]
["10:23,100","10:25,720","\"I'm going to escape\""]
["10:25,720","10:28,240","\"To the god\""]
["10:28,240","10:33,560","\"Well that guy scream at you if you go to the garden early. I hope let's see\""]
["10:33,560","10:39,140","\"Wow, it's the garden. You should really try to piss him off. It's a new\""]
["10:39,140","10:45,280","\"It's a new oasis collect dishes activate down the laundry. Whoa look over there\""]
["10:46,880","10:52,720","\"They're building a whole new highway. I love games like this where everything's like really detailed little scenes\""]
["10:52,720","10:58,560","\"Maybe you'd actually like these games then because you you said you haven't played any of them, right?\""]
["10:58,560","11:03,520","\"I played heavy rain, but I didn't think that one was great. It was a silly it was silly\""]
["11:03,520","11:14,000","\"They didn't feel like doing good fabric simulation when she grabs it they cut away every time she goes to\""]
["11:14,000","11:16,600","\"to grip one\""]
["11:16,600","11:18,700","\"Little girls kind of pissed off\""]
["11:18,700","11:25,620","\"Okay, little girl get in the box. I won't have to tell anyone about what happened hold on in what world\""]
["11:25,620","11:31,400","\"Do you have like an Android but not a fucking washer dryer combo?\""]
["11:31,400","11:37,200","\"Yeah, I know right. Yeah, why do you need a clothesline in this in this Android filled world?\""]
["11:37,200","11:43,700","\"She probably could generate enough heat to just dry the clothes inside herself. Well, should we ask let's ask her\""]
["11:43,800","11:48,480","\"Let's you know, let's do the most boring conversation possible. Yeah, it's care about the weather\""]
["11:48,480","11:56,240","\"Okay, let's talk about school\""]
["11:56,240","12:00,500","\"No, my dad says it's funnier if I'm still bit\""]
["12:00,500","12:04,000","\"Well\""]
["12:04,000","12:08,260","\"Look how you're just like don't you have a school you should be at\""]
["12:08,760","12:13,960","\"Yeah, this Android's really just not good at this. They want you to rewash the gross laundry\""]
["12:13,960","12:20,040","\"Oh that they just left outside. This is the toilet. Oh did her mom die or something? Is that the whole oh?\""]
["12:20,040","12:26,840","\"Again not answering those kinds of questions. No Tomar you've got to answer it\""]
["12:26,840","12:30,040","\"It's way more interesting if you just tell me what's happening. I don't want to see it for myself\""]
["12:30,040","12:37,900","\"This Android is kind of beautiful if you think about it. I actually have never thought about it any of the times you've brought that up\""]
["12:37,900","12:42,060","\"Because it's a whole Pandora's box why because\""]
["12:42,060","12:47,200","\"Trust me you don't want me up on this couch, right? I just I absolutely\""]
["12:47,200","12:56,040","\"Destroy couches when I'm up. Yeah, I don't believe it. So I could rip this couch right in half if I was up. What's happening here?\""]
["12:56,040","12:59,820","\"Feed her laundry for dinner\""]
["12:59,820","13:03,140","\"This game is good\""]
