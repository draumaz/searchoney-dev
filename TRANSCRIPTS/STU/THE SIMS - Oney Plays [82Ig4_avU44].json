["02:26,960","02:30,680","\"It's still like, the outfit is still very distinctly nostalgic,\""]
["02:30,680","02:31,520","\"too.\""]
["02:31,520","02:33,160","\"I have to applaud you on that.\""]
["02:33,160","02:35,160","\"- At least we nailed the body.\""]
["02:35,160","02:37,040","\"Now we gotta make the other two.\""]
["02:37,040","02:41,160","\"That's Toonie's classic garb right there.\""]
["02:41,160","02:48,760","\"Okay, Toonie is specifically your wheelhouse, Chris.\""]
["02:48,760","02:52,160","\"Either I or Tomar have any clue who the hell he is.\""]
["02:52,160","02:54,480","\"- It lies entirely in your sensibilities.\""]
["02:54,480","02:56,600","\"- If we're gonna make critic in Le Cara,\""]
["02:56,600","02:58,000","\"we gotta have Spoonie 'cause it's way--\""]
["02:58,000","03:00,720","\"- Wait, go to the right seven?\""]
["03:00,720","03:04,160","\"That's almost exactly Leon Cara's outfit right there.\""]
["03:04,160","03:06,320","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:06,320","03:08,320","\"Wait, wait, go to the right.\""]
["03:08,320","03:11,120","\"There's another contender for Leon Cara.\""]
["03:11,120","03:11,960","\"This one?\""]
["03:11,960","03:12,800","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:12,800","03:14,120","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:14,120","03:16,040","\"- No, you know what, Spoonie did used to wear something\""]
["03:16,040","03:18,640","\"like this in the video where he fucks girls in his bed.\""]
["03:18,640","03:19,640","\"Does spoonie...\""]
["03:19,640","03:20,640","\"Fuck.\""]
["03:20,640","03:23,360","\"You spoonie fox.\""]
["03:23,360","03:27,720","\"I refuse to believe this.\""]
["03:27,720","03:30,280","\"That was his unique trait within the group.\""]
["03:30,280","03:31,760","\"So one of these has to be spoonie.\""]
["03:31,760","03:32,760","\"We'll take a while.\""]
["03:32,760","03:34,760","\"Just process it wherever we go.\""]
["03:34,760","03:37,600","\"That's still good.\""]

["03:39,600","03:40,600","\"That's our guy.\""]
["03:40,600","03:45,600","\"This is gonna look so bad.\""]
["03:45,600","03:49,600","\"(laughter)\""]
["03:49,600","03:53,600","\"Don't change that at all. I want that to be how it is.\""]
["03:53,600","03:57,600","\"You can rotate it slightly, but...\""]
["03:57,600","04:01,600","\"It's like it's basis dripping off.\""]
["04:01,600","04:09,600","\"That's crazy. You know, I'm not changing that.\""]
["04:09,600","04:13,600","\"That's perfect.\""]
["04:13,600","04:15,600","\"[laughter]\""]
["04:15,600","04:17,600","\"That's great.\""]
["04:17,600","04:18,600","\"Okay.\""]
["04:18,600","04:20,600","\"I don't think I need to change anything else.\""]
["04:20,600","04:21,600","\"I wouldn't.\""]
["04:21,600","04:22,600","\"Save.\""]
["04:22,600","04:23,600","\"[laughter]\""]
["04:23,600","04:26,600","\"That doesn't even have the right hair color, but fuck it.\""]
["04:26,600","04:28,600","\"[laughter]\""]
["04:28,600","04:30,600","\"Okay, we're good.\""]
["04:30,600","04:32,600","\"And then we need Lewis.\""]
["04:32,600","04:35,600","\"Now, which one of these heads reflects him best?\""]
["04:35,600","04:37,600","\"The Great Lankara has lost us at launch.\""]

["04:52,600","04:53,560","\"Nah, you gotta...\""]
["04:53,560","04:55,560","\"You gotta give Linkara his garb.\""]
["04:55,560","04:57,400","\"His classic garb.\""]
["04:57,400","05:00,600","\"Me, I make the face smaller.\""]
["05:00,600","05:01,880","\"I feel like that'll...\""]
["05:01,880","05:05,400","\"Wait, what does it look like if you just make his face as tiny as you can?\""]
["05:05,400","05:08,040","\"Look at...\""]
["05:08,040","05:11,560","\"It's just Linkara's real mouth on this guy.\""]
["05:11,560","05:15,560","\"Just no matter how bad it gets to know that he's happy underneath.\""]
["05:15,560","05:17,560","\"Wait, no, that was his smile.\""]
["05:17,560","05:18,560","\"That was his true smile.\""]
