["19:20,420","19:22,420","\"It was my first day working at the castle today.\""]
["19:22,420","19:29,660","\"I was most shocked to see the other staff were all women. The mistress and her daughters were very adamant that they wouldn't bite. It was quite peculiar.\""]
["19:29,660","19:34,700","\"It's been two weeks since I started working at the castle and I'm a little afraid.\""]
["19:34,700","19:39,680","\"Another maid, Adela, made a mistake and Miss Daniela slashed her face with a knife.\""]

["19:58,340","20:00,640","\"I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.\""]
["20:00,640","20:05,640","\"Okay. Well, it seems like that guy was having a bad day.\""]
["20:05,640","20:06,840","\"But he left his fridge.\""]
["20:06,840","20:09,240","\"Seems like he was just kind of whining about work.\""]
