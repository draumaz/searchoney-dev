["00:12,800","00:14,800","\"Nah, I wouldn't say it was my favorite, but I liked it.\""]
["00:14,800","00:15,800","\"Oh, Luigi.\""]
["00:15,800","00:19,000","\"Ugh, yes.\""]
["00:19,000","00:20,200","\"Go green.\""]
["00:20,200","00:21,600","\"I don't recognize any of these characters.\""]
["00:21,600","00:23,200","\"I'm gonna be the little toadling.\""]
["00:23,200","00:24,200","\"*laughs*\""]
["00:24,200","00:25,400","\"You're the best little character.\""]
["00:25,400","00:27,000","\"You're our favorite little guy.\""]

["00:29,400","00:33,500","\"Yeah, he passed away last night, but don't worry. He'll be back soon\""]
["00:33,500","00:39,440","\"In the afterlife we planted him in the ground and then you one will grow in its place\""]
["00:39,440","00:42,320","\"So you don't have to worry about none of that\""]
["00:42,320","00:47,220","\"Really gonna play through Super Mario 3D\""]
["00:47,220","00:54,340","\"Watch this is the only instance of plumbing in the entire Mario cannon. Is it really? I don't know\""]
["00:54,340","00:56,360","\"It's the only one I can think of yeah\""]
["00:56,360","01:02,880","\"They actually friggin fix a pipe is the only reason he's a plumber because they put the pipes on the ground and they were like\""]
["01:02,880","01:05,680","\"That's why yep\""]
["01:05,680","01:11,640","\"Okay, kind of feels like it's one of those things that the guys that wrote the like manual came up with\""]
["01:11,640","01:13,600","\"probably\""]
["01:13,600","01:15,600","\"And he was a genius\""]
["01:15,600","01:22,720","\"He was really ahead of his time. Although I think that they said Mario's not a plumber anymore and his relationship with Peach is purely platonic\""]
["01:24,280","01:28,680","\"That I'm not playing anymore. Is this specifically Bowser's fury were playing or is this\""]
["01:28,680","01:35,640","\"3d world this is Bowser before he's pissed off. This is his origin story of getting mad at you\""]
["01:35,640","01:39,200","\"This is Bowser when he was still in therapy\""]
["01:39,200","01:44,280","\"Bowser's really working on himself. Yeah, they just went spelunking\""]
["01:44,280","01:47,080","\"Yeah, and the Bowser's wicked hole\""]
["01:47,080","01:50,120","\"He's gonna be fucking sprigging at the end of that\""]
["01:51,960","01:55,240","\"Right up is isn't that what happens in Mario and Luigi's?\""]
["01:55,240","02:01,220","\"Yeah, the big the Bowser's inside story or whatever. He's called\""]
["02:01,220","02:04,840","\"He's on the toilet and they come up through his pipes and then you know\""]
["02:04,840","02:11,680","\"Hilarity ensues. All right guys. I'm gonna say it. Why don't we just run pestle this stuff go straight to the castle\""]
["02:11,680","02:18,000","\"You like how Lyle and I are doing such a great job evenly following you in a perfect line. Yeah, what's happening?\""]
["02:18,840","02:24,140","\"You're just in control. I was joking. This is just what happens when you run the channel, man people follow you without question\""]
["02:24,140","02:28,400","\"Wait, wait, this is a funny observation. Why can't we just simply jump across this?\""]
["02:28,400","02:32,280","\"You can jump in the screen. Okay, let's try that\""]
["02:32,280","02:37,160","\"All right, this game's shit. Okay. It's this bullball. Okay now go figure\""]
["02:37,160","02:43,400","\"Not good. It's just a silly joke. It's just silly the super bell end\""]
["02:46,200","02:48,200","\"Editor you know what to do\""]
["02:48,200","02:56,600","\"So we get all of our Mario 64 moves I think I think you can do like your I can't figure out how to\""]
["02:56,600","03:00,180","\"Ground stop. It's try the shoulder button\""]
["03:00,180","03:09,000","\"Mario's back and better than ever. Oh, okay. Yeah, it is that's the game really big. I feel like Mario\""]
["03:09,000","03:12,520","\"Oh Marvie, comma-capped\""]
["03:14,160","03:19,920","\"Never played this one. He's told me really doesn't he just looks like a oh go on then say it\""]
["03:19,920","03:26,560","\"I don't know. He doesn't look like a cat your slur go on just a shoot your slur, man. You only got one chance\""]
["03:26,560","03:31,040","\"What's there he really looks like a go on say it?\""]
["03:31,040","03:38,400","\"It's like Eminem always said if you only had one slur would you make accounts if you only had one slur\""]
["03:38,400","03:43,040","\"If mom only made you one meal, you know, that's the origin of that\""]
["03:43,520","03:45,880","\"That's the origin of the one slayer from the lower\""]
["03:45,880","03:54,180","\"Spanish said the one slayer that's why has all the time in the world and was stupid to roll them all\""]
["03:54,180","04:01,080","\"One slur need actually was a slur. Yeah, that's a really good conspiracy theory\""]
["04:01,080","04:06,240","\"Yeah, we should do our own Lorax theory was the one slur\""]
["04:06,240","04:11,360","\"You know oh fuck this guy up. We all know what the one slur was\""]
["04:11,360","04:15,560","\"We're just afraid to say it. Okay. Wait, what?\""]
["04:15,560","04:21,600","\"Where did I go? I'm just happening sorry didn't mean to take you to this horrible place, but now that we're here\""]
["04:21,600","04:28,900","\"Let's explore this model of a cervix. This stamp is ours. Why can't there be a Mario game that doesn't look like\""]
["04:28,900","04:30,800","\"You know bullshit\""]
["04:30,800","04:34,680","\"Why can't there be like gross fungus all over the city and everyone's a dinosaur?\""]
["04:34,680","04:38,480","\"That would be kind of rad and then Mario could break his arm\""]
["04:39,080","04:44,140","\"Halfway through it, and then okay, I guess I'm not be mobile pop me\""]
["04:44,140","04:48,760","\"Yes, usually I wouldn't abide by such horrible things\""]

["05:02,980","05:07,440","\"Probably a little more earnestly. I hope all of that pressure is not just on me\""]
["05:07,440","05:11,780","\"-At least one eight-year-old said that before.\""]
["05:11,780","05:16,520","\"-I would hate the living this world.\""]
["05:16,520","05:17,620","\"-You're going to hate this.\""]
["05:17,620","05:19,520","\"-What a tune.\""]

["07:02,040","07:06,380","\"It's honestly kind of amazing is it should we not say the title of the video?\""]
["07:06,380","07:11,540","\"It wouldn't be online anymore, right? Like no no dude. I looked everywhere for it\""]

["07:51,640","07:56,580","\"He was just trying to make a clue to her he was trying\""]
["07:56,580","08:02,700","\"He was trying to brag to the world that he actually found a girlfriend.\""]

["08:20,900","08:25,420","\"It's probably because you're doing something that God never intended.\""]
["08:25,420","08:31,180","\"Why not make be that a and b or do the exact same thing on my controller? How is that useful?\""]
["08:31,180","08:34,260","\"Yes, we are smaller than Toad\""]
["08:34,260","08:38,100","\"Is it possible to rebind my controls\""]
