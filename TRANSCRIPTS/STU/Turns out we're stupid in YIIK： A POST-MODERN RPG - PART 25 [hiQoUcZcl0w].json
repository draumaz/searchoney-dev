["03:51,980","03:56,220","\"I feel like I saw an anime of parappa the rapper and they were all lanky and gross looking\""]
["03:56,220","04:00,740","\"It's weird. It doesn't actually follow the art style like you think they'd all be flat in the show or something\""]

["04:01,580","04:05,940","\"New characters. Is that real? It didn't come out over here, but yeah, there was an anime\""]
["04:05,940","04:08,900","\"It's okay\""]
["04:08,900","04:11,660","\"It's just kind of generic with a good theme song\""]
["04:11,660","04:16,260","\"I like intro. It's an original considering parappa as a series has a really good sense of humor\""]
["04:16,260","04:20,820","\"Yeah, it does. And that's the problem is the anime doesn't follow the humer as closely as the games have.\""]
["04:20,820","04:24,060","\"I really like a preppetoo's writing.\""]
["04:24,060","04:26,820","\"All of them are entertaining. They're all fun.\""]

["04:31,460","04:35,140","\"Oh, just two really. I tried playing one after two.\""]

["04:37,820","04:39,300","\"Yeah, I love to.\""]
["04:39,300","04:42,340","\"It doesn't help that the first game has weird timing.\""]

["04:46,100","04:49,180","\"Like no buffering at all. Yeah, it's really weird how they did it\""]
["04:49,180","04:55,860","\"Lammy's pretty good though. I like Lammy boomer bammer bammy. Yeah, you would like that\""]
["04:55,860","05:01,480","\"What is that supposed to mean a girls game? Oh for girls\""]
["05:01,480","05:05,740","\"Parapas in a team. No, don't care. They turn them into a girl\""]
["05:05,740","05:09,980","\"They sniff his dog ears to look more feminine. Oh no\""]

["05:16,780","05:26,840","\"I love the way he says stop it I do too. I didn't even get to catch the pun. It said he's unstoppable\""]
["05:26,840","05:30,980","\"It goes by and like half a second. We're missing lots of\""]
["05:30,980","05:36,980","\"Interesting things in this text and it goes by maybe like fix that, you know\""]
["05:36,980","05:41,900","\"It's weird because certain parts of the interface go by really quick\""]
["05:41,900","05:46,560","\"But then some of the animations go for way too long. The timing is all over the place\""]
["05:46,560","05:56,860","\"Yeah, you like an actual hero you did and it didn't last as long as it usually does I\""]
["05:56,860","06:04,540","\"Mean I could have swore we were upgrading our weapons and shit the whole time we were but I guess it just wasn't enough\""]
