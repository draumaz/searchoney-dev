["00:27,820","00:29,280","\"Yeah, it's fucking bender.\""]
["00:29,280","00:31,280","\"I was like I knew that sounded familiar\""]
["00:31,280","00:35,720","\"That's crazy. I've never heard him do a voice. That's just normal before\""]
["00:35,720","00:43,040","\"Fuck I mean that's a thing right is his voice not bender, but like like the dog from adventure time\""]
["00:43,040","00:45,680","\"That's his normal voice now, but he doesn't sound like that\""]
["00:45,680","00:48,720","\"God, I think this is just him. Yeah a lot younger\""]
["00:48,720","00:53,880","\"Whoa, oh my god you almost fucked yourself there\""]
["00:54,600","00:57,900","\"Dude, this is awesome. We got the leopard dash and the leopard leap\""]
["00:57,900","01:01,000","\"Let's not like let left we not forget the leopard\""]
["01:01,000","01:03,840","\"We should see if we could just speed run through the next level not kill anything\""]
["01:03,840","01:07,560","\"Yeah, you can probably I could see this being a game where you could run past a lot of people\""]
["01:07,560","01:11,000","\"Except for when it tells you you have to kill them. Yeah, let's try it\""]
["01:11,000","01:15,280","\"Let's try it once and see how far I can get and one mighty leopard leap\""]
["01:15,280","01:21,020","\"This was one leopard leap for man one leopard dash for mankind\""]
["01:21,880","01:23,880","\"They should have sold merch that said that\""]
["01:23,880","01:30,280","\"They should pay me eighteen thousand dollars for that idea\""]
["01:30,280","01:33,240","\"To license it for merch for this game\""]
["01:33,240","01:38,200","\"Do you see what I'm on now on the world map? I do the leopard leap. Oh you do. Yep\""]
["01:38,200","01:42,440","\"That's a nice that's actually a genuinely nice attention to detail thing\""]
["01:42,440","01:49,120","\"I know it's like you're growing stronger with every adversary you best even though this game is like literally a five out of ten\""]
["01:49,120","01:52,960","\"It still has a lot of heart to it. It does we're gonna beat all of typhoon\""]
["01:52,960","01:58,640","\"We'll see how far we can get without getting frustrated because that's getting pretty whoa\""]
["01:58,640","02:04,280","\"Oh, yeah, that's the guy that should have killed you you tried killing me and then you forgot\""]
["02:04,280","02:08,000","\"I remembered\""]
["02:08,000","02:13,600","\"It's so cool. Well, it's not a tiger noise is it? It's like a cougar\""]
["02:14,520","02:19,240","\"Or like a mountain. I don't know that is like a mountain lion sound yeah, wait\""]
["02:19,240","02:23,040","\"This is what's this guy doing? He's cross-boing me you fuck okay?\""]
["02:23,040","02:26,120","\"Use that magic on him you there you go. You can just bust through\""]
["02:26,120","02:34,760","\"What you survived it you made a snake nato there was health on top of that little pagoda - pagoda\""]
["02:34,760","02:41,600","\"You're just making up words now. I know I just said snake nato, but that wasn't an open invitation to start doing it\""]
["02:42,160","02:48,880","\"This sounds like a movie. Oh fuck dude. You're gonna kill yourself with your with your leopard leap. No\""]
["02:48,880","02:55,060","\"I'm skilled. Do you have to use your magic on that or a leopard leap is a lamentable liability\""]
["02:55,060","02:57,960","\"Look at me. Go to a saint you proud\""]
["02:57,960","03:01,280","\"Uh-huh\""]
["03:01,280","03:02,400","\"Oh\""]
["03:02,400","03:08,460","\"My god, I'm having so much fun now with the leopard leap. Yeah, look how cool it is. Oh fuck\""]
["03:09,080","03:17,880","\"Yeah, basic game design patterns say that this level should be easy to help you. Oh fuck really really admire your new powers\""]
["03:17,880","03:24,240","\"Oh, yeah, you can attack out of that. Yeah\""]
["03:24,240","03:28,300","\"What the fuck was that I don't know but it went\""]
["03:28,300","03:30,880","\"But I guess yet\""]
["03:30,880","03:36,240","\"Counts is a combo it refills your G hell. Yeah victory\""]
["03:37,920","03:40,320","\"Yeah, I can't see shit. Oh\""]
["03:40,320","03:48,920","\"You gotta keep swacking it hacking it. I think he hit it a couple of times during that fight so maybe\""]
["03:48,920","03:57,540","\"This like wide open level makes that really fun at least they considered that\""]
["03:57,540","04:00,680","\"Uh-huh, you can't see me, but I can see you\""]
["04:00,680","04:07,180","\"I liked it his stripes remain. That's a cool touch\""]
["04:07,180","04:13,980","\"That is cool. Oh my god. There's a lot of snake us. You're fucking tornado. Let me out damn it\""]
["04:13,980","04:21,360","\"This is stupid his noise. It almost sounds like screaming monkeys\""]
["04:21,360","04:26,420","\"Wait, that is was\""]
["04:26,420","04:32,620","\"Back ah fuck you\""]
["04:35,300","04:38,520","\"Wait, what just happened wait are you looping now? Oh?\""]
["04:38,520","04:45,460","\"Leave me alone. This is an open is an open world level. Oh my god the camera's changing\""]
["04:45,460","04:51,420","\"It's growing more mature with time probably looking for a way to rotate that platform\""]
["04:51,420","04:54,340","\"So to your right there that that little mountain zone\""]
["04:54,340","04:55,120","\"Yeah, here you go\""]
["04:55,120","05:00,300","\"This will let you rotate and then you got to go around and use that to get to the park which is hopefully the end\""]
["05:00,300","05:03,460","\"Man, that's actually a crazy little puzzle to put in\""]
["05:04,780","05:11,960","\"Remember we figured it out because we're smart as children in 1999. Yeah big brain kids\""]
["05:11,960","05:19,960","\"Now with the big brain kids now should be straight up, right? It should be to his left. Oh, yeah, Lyle's right\""]
["05:19,960","05:23,380","\"I don't know if he'll make that jump, but he could just try to leopard leap of faith\""]
["05:23,380","05:30,280","\"Wait a minute. Oh, I see what you're saying. It's the left here, right is it but but that's where it would be rotated\""]
["05:30,280","05:36,060","\"It was the other way it's got see can you make it I think you can make it I believe in chris O'neal\""]
["05:36,060","05:41,360","\"Wait it is rotators. I'm confused. Oh, you're going the right way\""]
["05:41,360","05:46,240","\"You have a little fucking legend the camera just kind of got me disoriented\""]
["05:46,240","05:49,360","\"yeah\""]
["05:49,360","05:53,680","\"There you go, okay halfway there\""]
["05:57,640","05:59,240","\"I mean, let me in.\""]
["05:59,240","06:00,240","\"- Grab the coin.\""]
["06:00,240","06:02,040","\"- That was so fucking cool.\""]
["06:02,040","06:02,880","\"- Yeah, you actually did,\""]
["06:02,880","06:04,920","\"that was like you did better on that level\""]
["06:04,920","06:06,080","\"than the last couple.\""]
["06:06,080","06:07,640","\"- That level felt half as long,\""]
["06:07,640","06:08,840","\"and I was gonna ask that earlier\""]
["06:08,840","06:11,120","\"if the leper dash would make the levels\""]
["06:11,120","06:12,520","\"feel way shorter now.\""]
["06:12,520","06:13,680","\"- Maybe.\""]
["06:13,680","06:15,720","\"- Or maybe. - It's always a possibility.\""]
["06:15,720","06:18,920","\"- Or that was just them giving you an easier level\""]
["06:18,920","06:20,880","\"to enjoy your new power.\""]
["06:20,880","06:24,120","\"And now it's gonna be back to a slog after this.\""]
["06:24,120","06:26,400","\"- All I know is I love being Thai.\""]
["06:26,400","06:28,040","\"- It's a Philippine typhoon.\""]
["06:28,040","06:28,880","\"- So you're mantis. - A little being\""]
["06:28,880","06:29,720","\"in this world.\""]
["06:29,720","06:32,240","\"- You're mantis one and leopard styles.\""]
["06:32,240","06:36,760","\"- Yeah, I wanna see the other styles now so bad.\""]
["06:36,760","06:39,280","\"- This was the first time Pandora syndrome\""]
["06:39,280","06:41,880","\"was observed in the human species.\""]
["06:41,880","06:43,680","\"- Yeah, I can't believe I don't live in a world\""]
["06:43,680","06:45,480","\"as beautiful as that of typhoon.\""]
["06:45,480","06:47,600","\"- It's pretty beautiful.\""]
["06:47,600","06:48,800","\"- Mantis caves.\""]
["06:48,800","06:50,520","\"- But this wouldn't give you Pandora syndrome.\""]
["06:50,520","06:53,240","\"This would just make you assume this is what China's like\""]
["06:53,240","06:54,520","\"and just make you wanna move.\""]
["06:54,520","06:58,520","\"Yeah, join the Democratic People's Republic of China or whatever.\""]
["06:58,520","07:00,520","\"But duh!\""]
["07:00,520","07:03,520","\"Is that me?\""]
["07:03,520","07:04,520","\"Sorry, I'll tell you.\""]
["07:04,520","07:06,520","\"That was like a magical wind chime that gives you your strength.\""]
["07:06,520","07:07,520","\"(laughs)\""]
["07:07,520","07:08,520","\"The Tomar Chime.\""]

["07:14,520","07:17,520","\"Tomar gets one day of your life added to his.\""]
["07:17,520","07:19,520","\"It's not a bad deal, really.\""]
["07:19,520","07:22,520","\"I got a dash upstream to fight the current.\""]
["07:22,520","07:24,000","\"Okay\""]
["07:24,000","07:26,920","\"What the fuck didn't tell me to be fucking eels?\""]

["07:50,760","07:55,600","\"Fuck you I hate it here. I hate it here. Can you just run from him?\""]
["07:55,600","08:03,760","\"Yeah, you should just leopard it through the whole level look until it forces you to stop for a challenge\""]
["08:03,760","08:05,520","\"Oh, I hate you\""]
["08:05,520","08:11,640","\"You can't grab me you ran away you do a cheese scroll. Oh, you had a leopard leap that use your leopard leap\""]

["08:57,640","09:00,560","\"They're not very powerful\""]
["09:00,560","09:07,360","\"But they look cool those eels have been scarier so far. Yeah, I don't know how you're supposed to beat those without the taking damage\""]
["09:07,360","09:13,000","\"I bet you could just run right past these guys the whole fun of this game is trying to skip everything\""]
["09:13,480","09:16,680","\"It is look you already made it to the gold coin the fuck\""]
["09:16,680","09:20,880","\"There you go, okay\""]

["10:34,360","10:36,760","\"Oh man, I hope there's monkeys in this fucking game.\""]
["10:36,760","10:37,600","\"Jesus.\""]
["10:38,880","10:43,080","\"How could you make a Kung Fu animal game without my monkey?\""]
["10:43,080","10:47,420","\"I don't know. I feel like the actual designs in the world of this game is pretty cool.\""]
["10:47,420","10:49,420","\"But yeah, this game...\""]
["10:49,420","10:53,640","\"I'm surprised it got lost as hard as it did.\""]
["10:53,640","10:54,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:54,000","10:55,380","\"Like, I've never heard of it.\""]
["10:55,380","10:58,200","\"Like, this seems like the kind of game that should have sequels.\""]
["10:58,200","11:01,280","\"I feel like I've heard of it, but...\""]
["11:01,280","11:03,060","\"Definitely never played it.\""]
["11:03,060","11:05,140","\"'Cause I never owned a PlayStation.\""]
["11:05,640","11:09,640","\"This should have been the the rough beginning and it should have become like a fucking masterpiece\""]
["11:09,640","11:12,360","\"But yeah, I like the second or third one. Yeah, yeah\""]
["11:12,360","11:19,880","\"It's because dreamworks gave up on the on just making like game game stuff for anything other than their like movie IPs\""]
["11:19,880","11:22,520","\"So was this pre-shrek when was Shrek?\""]
["11:22,520","11:26,000","\"I'm pretty sure this is pretty shrek\""]
["11:26,000","11:31,880","\"Shrek is probably like 2001 or something. Let's see what sounds right Shrek\""]
["11:32,760","11:34,360","\"release date\""]
["11:34,360","11:42,440","\"Yep, April 22nd 2001, but I wonder how long both of them were in development for their development may have overlapped a little bit\""]
["11:42,440","11:47,840","\"But so Shrek might have a little cameo appearance at the end of this. Yeah, you will not\""]
["11:47,840","11:52,080","\"At the end Shrek with an eyepatch comes out and it goes\""]
["11:52,080","11:55,560","\"TIE FOOD! Wait, it seems like they just were too lazy to make a boss\""]
["11:55,560","12:00,120","\"So they just made you do that instead. But we got Mantis. Oh wait. What's this guy again?\""]
["12:00,640","12:02,640","\"He's my master. I'm here to betray you\""]
