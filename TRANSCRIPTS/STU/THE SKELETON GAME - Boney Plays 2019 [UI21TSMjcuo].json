["08:55,340","08:58,660","\"I usually I don't care I really believe the 12 year old\""]
["08:58,660","09:03,060","\"dude it's every every instance of your they fucked it up every single one\""]
["09:03,060","09:07,580","\"like literally they've not gotten one instance of your correct so far you\""]
["09:07,580","09:12,020","\"know what's over it what if it if this was made by twelve you only feel bad\""]

["09:16,820","09:18,820","\"Skeletal\""]
["09:18,820","09:25,780","\"Agenda we were we were imagining this game was made by like a four-year-old dude with like cigarette ashes on the ground around them\""]
["09:25,780","09:30,580","\"It's really just the text that makes it feel that way\""]
["09:30,580","09:37,380","\"It could just be someone who doesn't have English as their first language if this was made by a 12-year-old is honestly kind of impressed\""]
["09:37,380","09:41,060","\"Yeah, no, I found the cemetery I could see it\""]
["09:43,100","09:45,100","\"Come on though\""]
["09:45,100","09:49,380","\"But do you think a 12-year-old would actually be able to get something published on steam?\""]
["09:49,380","09:51,380","\"I guess if their parents helped them\""]
["09:51,380","09:55,460","\"Yeah, you could get a 12-year-old their smart man. I was able to do that check probably could have figured it out\""]
["09:55,460","10:01,820","\"I guess you're right, but I think you would have also spelled your correctly. I don't think this is a 12-year-old. I could be wrong\""]
["10:01,820","10:07,260","\"That's actually really scary\""]
["10:07,260","10:19,620","\"I'm going to the puke. I'm going to love. There's something at the end of the graveyard here apparently.\""]
["10:19,620","10:24,860","\"Allegedly. Go to that very center one. It looks like there's a little thing protruding.\""]
["10:24,860","10:30,860","\"That's the right. Yeah, that one. Oh no. The skeleton's a skeleton with a sword.\""]
["10:30,860","10:36,660","\"Well, I mean, that's the end of the game then huh? I think that's the skeleton\""]
["10:36,660","10:41,380","\"That cannot be the fucking end of the game dude. Congratulations. That's the skeleton\""]
["10:41,380","10:43,380","\"I don't believe that the whole game is just once you see that\""]
["10:43,380","10:50,520","\"Look at that. That's not that can't be like the punchline. So does that's even the same skeleton that's in all the photos that you've been\""]
["10:50,520","10:56,540","\"We gotta be wrong it must be more that is definitely not the ending dude\""]
["10:56,540","10:59,940","\"Maybe you when you go to leave he follows you or something\""]
["10:59,940","11:02,580","\"I think my friends are just screwing around\""]
["11:02,580","11:11,500","\"We gotta be missing something because they would have played like a Horace D or something if that was what you're supposed to see\""]
["11:11,500","11:13,500","\"Did he really fuck with us?\""]
["11:13,500","11:18,940","\"Dude, I think the 12 year old theories like getting stronger by the minute\""]
["11:18,940","11:21,180","\"Do you think maybe in the mind of a 12 year old?\""]
["11:21,180","11:26,040","\"They expected the player to like find that and just fucking\""]
["11:26,040","11:29,500","\"Punch the monitor and turn it off\""]
["11:29,500","11:31,100","\"I\""]
["11:31,100","11:33,100","\"Think that might be the most\""]
["11:33,100","11:35,100","\"That is not the fucking\""]
["11:35,100","11:38,400","\"There's no way that's true even I was just joking about it dude\""]
["11:38,400","11:42,200","\"I think that's true that is not the fucking anything gave there. That's the skeleton\""]
["11:42,200","11:46,220","\"It's great to see the little blood trail it goes to this one over here\""]
["11:46,220","11:48,220","\"Maybe you're supposed to follow the blood trail\""]
["11:48,220","11:52,380","\"You follow it to the edge here\""]
["11:52,380","11:56,900","\"No, I guess not I don't know I'm out of ideas\""]
["11:57,500","12:00,900","\"So I follow the blood trail the other direction. I swear to fucking god dude\""]
["12:00,900","12:05,740","\"I think that's what happened if all the blood trail the other direction ends here\""]
["12:05,740","12:08,380","\"We'll just go the way it's facing\""]
["12:08,380","12:15,300","\"You the blood splats got further apart because they broke into a run. He said did the guy say oh yeah\""]
["12:15,300","12:17,300","\"Yeah, I was gonna say he said it we would\""]
["12:17,300","12:24,140","\"Jesus Christ dude, what do I do? How do I shoot? Can you press one to pull out the gun no press?\""]
["12:24,140","12:26,440","\"Press to write right to run to\""]
["12:26,440","12:29,340","\"Dude his music is all blown out and\""]
["12:29,340","12:38,300","\"You and your friend you and your friends go I'll get captured by this skeleton in the cemetery\""]
["12:38,300","12:44,320","\"I love all your leaving a whole bunch of questions unanswered who is the skeleton?\""]
["12:44,320","12:50,340","\"Why did he capture you comma and what made him angry all clues are in the survival\""]
["12:50,340","12:53,480","\"You gotta play again. I actually want to know what happens though survival maps\""]
["12:53,480","12:58,100","\"the woods all the clues are in the survival maps\""]
["12:58,100","13:02,820","\"Listen to the dead some music the louder gets the skeleton is near you\""]
["13:02,820","13:10,520","\"You think there's good. There's a really great underlying story in here. This is so dark. You can't even see I can't even do anything\""]
["13:10,520","13:14,180","\"I don't have a gun or anything. Hey, I remember this\""]
["13:14,180","13:16,820","\"It's the same pizza\""]
["13:17,940","13:22,520","\"There's a lot of piano I've ever heard my life pianos don't distort like that\""]
