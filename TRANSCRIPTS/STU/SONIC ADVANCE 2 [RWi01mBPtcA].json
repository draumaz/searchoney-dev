["01:03,320","01:08,320","\"They do not tell you that. In fact, one stage later, at some point, oh god, I missed it all.\""]
["01:08,320","01:13,320","\"At one point we will hit a stage that if you don't know that, you will fucking die every single time.\""]
["01:13,320","01:14,320","\"Really?\""]

["06:49,440","06:52,880","\"It was way off in the distance, but we finally got to where it was and we looked to the right\""]
["06:52,880","06:55,280","\"It's just this like nice old man. He's like hello\""]
["06:55,280","06:57,480","\"He's just holding up a deer's like fucking\""]

["07:00,880","07:03,380","\"No, we both side and we both said it.\""]
["07:03,380","07:03,980","\"That's scary.\""]

["07:08,280","07:13,280","\"Actually Chris, you don't know that skin walkers can take the form of people?\""]
["07:13,280","07:14,780","\"I guess probably.\""]
["07:14,780","07:18,280","\"So he could have just been the nice old man until you turn the corner in his face.\""]
["07:18,280","07:22,280","\"I swear to God, this is what we both exactly saw and said to each other.\""]

["07:34,200","07:37,320","\"That's not a win to go Chris, that's a skinwalker. You saw a skinwalker.\""]
["07:37,320","07:41,800","\"Okay what's a win to go? A win to go is like this like nightmarish spider creature.\""]
["07:41,800","07:45,960","\"Oh I don't think I've ever heard a win to go described as a spider. I always thought it was like a\""]

["07:46,680","07:49,480","\"Chimera or like a like a Yeti or something. It's a demon.\""]
["07:49,480","07:52,360","\"Okay well anyway I saw a monster. It's a monster.\""]
["07:52,360","07:58,360","\"Kinpuker in real life, okay, and we both like looked at each other was like what you saw what I saw\""]

["08:51,740","08:54,940","\"It was looking like that. I'm not even kidding. It was like doing that.\""]
["08:54,940","09:00,700","\"That's scary. It was scary. I mean fuck that. You should have just hit it with your car\""]
["09:00,700","09:04,940","\"and then found out it was just an innocent old man. It was way in the distance but we both saw it.\""]
["09:04,940","09:09,580","\"I was supposed to like hit the ball. Uh you're supposed to kill. I don't know why I hit the cannon.\""]
