["09:57,060","10:02,340","\"Adjustable, you're I mean if it's that hard you probably did just need to adjust the pressure down\""]
["10:02,340","10:06,180","\"Is that like a normal thing do you have to build up bidet calluses?\""]
["10:06,180","10:14,860","\"Just adjustable based on what the pre the pressure of the water already is in your home or something like\""]
["10:15,580","10:17,860","\"I think that's the idea anyway.\""]
["10:17,860","10:19,660","\"- Is the whole point that it literally,\""]
["10:19,660","10:23,060","\"like pressure washes the shit off your surface of your asshole\""]

["10:34,380","10:36,180","\"- Oh, you're making a trail.\""]
["10:36,180","10:37,180","\"- Or the goo.\""]
["10:37,180","10:38,260","\"Is it water or is it goo?\""]

["10:50,260","10:51,740","\"Alrighty then.\""]
["10:51,740","10:53,780","\"Alrighty. Okay.\""]
["10:53,780","10:56,860","\"This was fire oil physics.\""]

["10:58,460","10:59,900","\"Got oil physics.\""]
["10:59,900","11:02,220","\"That was not communicated well, but.\""]
["11:02,220","11:04,500","\"(screaming)\""]
["11:04,500","11:05,340","\"Ow.\""]
["11:05,340","11:08,020","\"This honestly is a well-made game so far.\""]
["11:08,020","11:09,700","\"There's been nothing horrible about it.\""]
["11:09,700","11:10,540","\"Saying a lot.\""]
["11:10,540","11:11,380","\"Is that our standard?\""]
["11:11,380","11:12,820","\"Just nothing horrible?\""]

["11:13,660","11:14,660","\"Yeah, honestly.\""]
["11:14,660","11:17,420","\"Unlike most games that just pissed me off.\""]
["11:17,420","11:19,660","\"This is just a wholesome time with a ball.\""]
["11:19,660","11:21,140","\"And it's called the ball.\""]
["11:21,140","11:24,660","\"I can't believe this game isn't famous because it's got such a stupid name.\""]
["11:24,660","11:27,380","\"I wonder if no other game can call itself a ball.\""]
["11:27,380","11:28,940","\"Is it really a stupid name?\""]
["11:28,940","11:32,540","\"If it's the best name you could possibly have to describe the game?\""]
["11:32,540","11:33,380","\"I guess not.\""]
["11:33,380","11:36,300","\"They should call it \"\"Rolly Polly\"\" in the adventures of...\""]
