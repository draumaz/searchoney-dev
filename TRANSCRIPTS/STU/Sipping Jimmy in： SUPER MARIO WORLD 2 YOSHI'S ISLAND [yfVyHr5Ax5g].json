["11:31,900","11:38,020","\"I like that the Jeff Goldblum remake of the flies an entirely different idea because in that one he just morphs into one over time\""]
["11:38,020","11:43,580","\"But in the older one, he's like it's a fly's head gets put on the body\""]
["11:43,580","11:48,420","\"So it's basically the fly is the fly still, but he's got the body of a human great\""]

["11:54,980","11:59,100","\"Come on, we got three of them. You know what that means though\""]

["12:05,780","12:11,860","\"I wouldn't even heard a fly because they're small but if one was your size it would be the supported\""]
["12:11,860","12:16,020","\"I just gave it up the density of its atom mass would not work at a bigger high\""]
["12:16,020","12:17,020","\"You're sure\""]
["12:17,020","12:23,340","\"Under a zone way I thought it's more to do the side of nature the exoskeleton fly if I was the size of a fly\""]
["12:23,340","12:25,340","\"I'd kick the fuck out of you\""]
["12:25,340","12:35,380","\"No, I fly into your mouth and crawl into your brain and give you like diseases this guy's got a weird disease\""]

["13:15,020","13:17,540","\"Right I\""]
["13:17,540","13:21,500","\"Hate that you could just turn things into eggs sick. What's wrong with that?\""]
["13:21,500","13:26,220","\"They're just encased in a fucking hard egg shell instantly. They're not reproductive eggs\""]
["13:26,220","13:30,460","\"They're just you're trapping enemies in there and like making them suffer\""]
["13:30,460","13:35,020","\"I think there's like a poop in those eggs. Oh god, baby Mario. I\""]

["13:58,200","14:02,200","\"But the way he talked it is so funny.\""]
["14:02,200","14:06,200","\"Oh, I think most of the posts are like, that'd be fucking gross.\""]
["14:06,200","14:09,200","\"That'd be weird, right? If he had stinky eggs.\""]
["14:09,200","14:11,200","\"I want to smell them.\""]
["14:11,200","14:14,200","\"He ends it with a zinger.\""]
