["00:46,480","00:48,440","\"- I was gonna say I haven't played Shovel Knight\""]
["00:48,440","00:51,560","\"since before it had any DLC.\""]
["00:51,560","00:53,760","\"- So why did it take so long for us to play this game?\""]
["00:53,760","00:56,800","\"- Because it was made in the 1980s, just look at it.\""]
["00:56,800","00:58,200","\"I'm sorry to burst your bubble,\""]

["01:14,560","01:16,080","\"that he himself drew.\""]
["01:16,080","01:19,240","\"Then he realized he didn't know how to cook macaroni on his own\""]
["01:19,240","01:23,160","\"and had to find his dad.\""]
["01:23,160","01:26,880","\"He fried bacon in an open frying pan, burning his body.\""]

["02:54,080","02:55,080","\"Go figure.\""]
["02:55,080","03:00,440","\"Yeah, there's a lot of things in this game where you'd absolutely fuck the other person if there wasn't a mechanic like that\""]
["03:00,440","03:05,280","\"Where you have to like you stupid bug bounce on enemies to get to places\""]
["03:05,280","03:09,120","\"Just like climbing the corporate ladder huh Tomar\""]

["03:31,080","03:31,960","\"Shut up.\""]
["03:31,960","03:36,120","\"Not a single person likes, especially not this song.\""]

["03:40,480","03:43,960","\"You got bullied in school for that.\""]
["03:43,960","03:45,720","\"Watch out, Tomar.\""]
["03:45,720","03:47,480","\"There's more than meets the eye with this fellow.\""]

["03:48,380","03:50,200","\"He's got a secret.\""]

["03:54,440","03:58,200","\"What was do you have any hint as to what his secret was?\""]
["03:58,200","03:59,480","\"Not even a single one.\""]
["03:59,480","04:00,520","\"No, you lost that.\""]
["04:00,520","04:02,160","\"You fuck you, Tomar.\""]
["04:02,160","04:05,600","\"Tomar, we ever talked about how much we hated each other?\""]
["04:05,600","04:06,640","\"No.\""]
["04:06,640","04:08,920","\"Do you want to do that on this on this episode?\""]
["04:08,920","04:09,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:09,160","04:12,680","\"When we first met me and Tomar hated each other so much, we'd make them horrible\""]
["04:12,680","04:14,600","\"rumors and try to ruin each other's careers.\""]
["04:15,600","04:19,360","\"Almost ruined years a couple times go on go get into it\""]
["04:19,360","04:24,320","\"I'm not gonna make it this shit up on the spot\""]
["04:24,320","04:27,360","\"You ruined it\""]
["04:27,360","04:32,000","\"Actually, Chris and Tomar can't even be in the same room with each other when they're not on camera\""]
["04:32,000","04:36,920","\"That is true. I want us to have like a seat can't both fit in the shot\""]
["04:36,920","04:41,240","\"I want us to have a cool movie story where we hate each other at the start, but we learn to love each other throughout\""]
["04:43,040","04:46,260","\"Well, I mean like in a movie not on the set of a movie\""]
["04:46,260","04:55,040","\"Let's learn to love each other like 30% of the way through so then we can have our big like cliche falling out moment around\""]
["04:55,040","05:01,280","\"Like 85% I love those and then make up at 95% for the climax right?\""]
["05:01,280","05:06,760","\"Yeah, it's got to be something that could be easily explained if you like would talk to each other for five minutes\""]
["05:06,760","05:10,120","\"But you just don't give them the chance you just storm out the door\""]
["05:10,120","05:15,720","\"\"\"Tomb where you walk in and I'm like stabbing Jaxie in the heart, but it turns out I was trying to stab the caterpillar on her heart.\"\"\""]

["05:18,960","05:20,300","\"\"\"conveniently she also did.\"\"\""]
["05:20,300","05:23,140","\"\"\"And why did you make the fullest choice to stab at it?\"\"\""]

["05:25,440","05:32,680","\"\"\"Right. Saving her from the caterpillar therefore. It's a poisonous caterpillar found only in the deepest darkest swamps of LA.\"\"\""]
["05:32,680","05:33,180","\"\"\"See.\"\"\""]
["05:33,180","05:37,680","\"\"\"Yeah, and then she didn't think to mention it at any point between that and the end of the movie.\"\"\""]
["05:37,680","05:38,320","\"\"\"What the fuck?!\"\"\""]
["05:38,320","05:40,040","\"\"\"Despite all you loser.\"\"\""]
["05:40,040","05:49,460","\"I'm obviously just just keep going. You press a you press a to rejoin. Oh, okay. I took all your yummy money, dude\""]
["05:49,460","05:51,960","\"It's okay. I'm pretty sure we share all our money\""]
["05:51,960","05:54,840","\"Really? I'm still not\""]
["05:54,840","06:01,520","\"Okay, okay. It's just you press down. I've been doing it wrong. I've been pressing down and attack everyone makes mistakes\""]
["06:01,520","06:08,040","\"Looks in the camera. Oh, he just holds it. I thought it was like a timing thing like shovel like a hollow knight\""]
["06:08,040","06:10,040","\"I totally forgot how that\""]
["06:10,040","06:13,160","\"Spring mechanic worked. Oh, no, this is a secret area, right?\""]
["06:13,160","06:16,960","\"We should be saying that all knights look the same to you Tomar. All right, Lyle\""]
["06:16,960","06:20,400","\"If you were to delete everything to do with this game, how would you go about doing it?\""]
["06:20,400","06:21,920","\"I'd start with that guy\""]
["06:21,920","06:29,160","\"That's actually just a given with that big fat green bat. Look at his fucking face. Yeah, see you did it for me\""]
["06:29,160","06:36,320","\"Sardi Gras. He killed me. Oh, that was a secret. That was the secret. You should have let you can rejoin\""]
["06:36,320","06:38,580","\"Well, let me you press it a a\""]
["06:38,580","06:42,120","\"Uh, maybe it takes a bit press. I\""]
["06:42,120","06:47,200","\"Don't know maybe I'm fucked you've run out of world. Maybe I can rejoin here\""]
["06:47,200","06:51,360","\"Is there certain amount of like lot maybe it's after I do that what can you get it?\""]
["06:51,360","06:55,640","\"Oh, I think it might take a bit of Tomars health if you rejoin\""]
["06:55,640","06:59,840","\"Oh, so it's because I'm ours like one hit because I only go back you missed a secret\""]
["07:01,120","07:05,960","\"I don't know how to go down there left like go down here. Yes\""]
["07:05,960","07:10,180","\"On the top of the ledge right to you right below you and go to the right\""]
["07:10,180","07:12,980","\"You think it's just like oh\""]
["07:12,980","07:15,900","\"No the secret\""]
["07:15,900","07:23,800","\"That fuck is slipper and goddamn bastard by the way be careful jumping on the checkpoints like that Tomar\""]
["07:23,800","07:29,120","\"You can't actually break them. Oh fuck really not those, but there are there are ones that you can oh\""]
["07:29,120","07:35,640","\"It's just like a cool like it's it's just like a look at me and kind of it gives you coins if you break the checkpoint\""]
["07:35,640","07:38,480","\"Like if you're really confident that you can just fucking do it\""]
["07:38,480","07:42,040","\"which is as\""]
["07:42,040","07:47,680","\"Say when it comes to like gems and jewels there's certain things that\""]
["07:47,680","07:53,680","\"Shouldn't be appetizing in any way shape or form, but it's like I don't know they're colorful\""]
["07:53,680","07:56,080","\"They're like like fruits or something\""]
["07:56,080","08:01,680","\"There's something about the human eye that when you see jewels, you're like I want to bite into that because they're inherently satisfying\""]
["08:01,680","08:03,680","\"Uh-oh get my little jewels\""]
["08:03,680","08:08,520","\"Also, that's a problem that everyone runs into and they're making a game\""]
["08:08,520","08:13,440","\"What making things look delicious? No making like something that's not cliche like jewels\""]
["08:13,440","08:18,360","\"But then realizing that jewels are cliche because they're perfect. Yeah, and people want to chew on them\""]
["08:18,360","08:23,840","\"You want to think you can read your own. Oh, yeah, my bad when I was younger. Do you ever watch that show the crystal maze?\""]
["08:24,240","08:29,340","\"No, maybe that was a European thing. What was it about? It was literally it was weird\""]
["08:29,340","08:33,980","\"It was a it was like a game show where you go through all these different like trials and cool stuff\""]
["08:33,980","08:37,320","\"And at the end of the show they give you like a thousand dollars, which is nothing\""]
["08:37,320","08:40,120","\"But they also give you a really cool crystal because it was called the crystal maze\""]
["08:40,120","08:42,980","\"Hmm, but I always wanted that crystal growing up\""]
["08:42,980","08:50,720","\"Yeah, some some like 38 year old has one. Yeah, it's meaningless. They forgot about it. Yeah\""]
["08:52,280","08:58,480","\"And you're giving it to a kid too so that kid probably like fucking took it to social studies class in law no no no\""]
["08:58,480","09:03,200","\"Sorry the crystal maze was an adult show. Oh, it's so an adult not a crystal and those people are dead now\""]
["09:03,200","09:07,320","\"Oh, okay, so some wait is there anything to the left? I need to adjust my my\""]
["09:07,320","09:14,640","\"Retorical scenario where now it's a 78 year old person that has the crystal. Yeah, see that changes a lot\""]
["09:14,640","09:19,460","\"I mean it was just backtracking or is this a secret area? It's like a secret you haven't got those jewels yet\""]
["09:19,460","09:23,260","\"That's true. See if you think about like a 36-year-old with a jewel, it's not very good\""]
["09:23,260","09:26,380","\"But if you think about like someone older with a jewel, then you're like, that's funny\""]
["09:26,380","09:34,380","\"All I know is shiny things are just cool. That's why magpies are fucking cool. I'm glad they added a little co-op mode to this\""]
["09:34,380","09:40,460","\"It's real cool. I've always thought like more kind of retroy games need to have it. Uh-oh\""]
["09:40,460","09:44,100","\"Black Knight. Oh, that doesn't age very well. Oh\""]
["09:44,900","09:49,900","\"I always knew you were going to make a joke about the color of my skin. Oh\""]
["09:49,900","09:57,220","\"So the bosses actually have twice as much health because it's co-op really yeah\""]
["09:57,220","10:00,180","\"That doesn't make any sense\""]
["10:00,180","10:04,860","\"Yeah, cuz you got two guys wailing on him. I'm just having a little silly troll\""]
["10:04,860","10:08,620","\"Dude we're kicking ass. Oh you\""]
["10:08,620","10:12,860","\"That was sick had no idea you could do that I\""]
["10:14,500","10:20,780","\"Uh-huh dickhead. Yeah, just hit his punishment when he does that like stand next to him and hit him. He's holding me. Oh\""]
["10:20,780","10:25,220","\"He shoveled at me. How come everyone has a damn shovel? Yeah\""]
["10:25,220","10:34,100","\"Seems like the trick to like I'm stupid being good at a game like this or any game really that's even remotely challenging\""]
["10:34,100","10:37,460","\"It's just you you worry about not getting hit before you worry about\""]
["10:37,460","10:43,700","\"Hitting a thing. This is a tool mark. Oh, you got fucking dug on. We're so stupid and ugly\""]
["10:43,700","10:47,000","\"Let's try that again. What do you say? We got this grab the loot\""]
["10:47,000","10:50,240","\"Was that a loot crate?\""]
["10:50,240","10:56,580","\"Yeah, let's just focus on top hits just focus on unless unless he's doing his stabbing then try to get aside\""]
["10:56,580","10:58,860","\"Yeah, let's just focus on getting epic gamer loot\""]
["10:58,860","11:05,360","\"I remember everyone was so on board with loot crate at the very start and then they slowly realized they shitty it was I\""]
["11:05,360","11:11,160","\"Feel like something like that is bound to just be like unsold inventory of stuff. Yes, it is\""]
["11:11,160","11:19,500","\"I uh have I ever told my loot crate? Yeah, you did thing on this. Okay, but basically I did a I did a brand deal with loot crate where I'm like\""]
["11:19,500","11:20,000","\"I\""]
["11:20,000","11:21,080","\"Oh, he hit a back again\""]
["11:21,080","11:25,460","\"This is definitely not something I would ever buy can I make fun of it and they were like yeah?\""]
