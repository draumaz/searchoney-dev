["02:07,020","02:20,280","\"Are you meant to absolve yourself of like any moral quandary here babe by just being like oh, they're all infected\""]

["02:31,220","02:37,780","\"Hey, everybody literally everybody in this town has a worm in their head. It doesn't spell it out, but it like so\""]
["02:37,780","02:42,700","\"You're trying to make excuses right now. You might have at least killed an innocent person\""]
["02:42,700","02:49,160","\"I might have but I don't think so also if I'm in another country what stays in that country you do in that country\""]
["02:49,160","02:50,640","\"Yeah, that's true. Once he leaves, he--\""]
["02:50,640","02:52,720","\"I don't get it. The Leanche told him work.\""]
["02:52,720","02:56,280","\"Were you a bionicle boy?\""]
["02:56,280","03:02,480","\"Yeah, I tried, but I wasn't into this action vibe\""]
["03:02,480","03:03,480","\"they were trying to go for.\""]
["03:03,480","03:07,000","\"Yeah, it was more cool when there were a weird freaky tribal thing.\""]
["03:07,000","03:10,400","\"The first one I ever got was one that could throw a disc.\""]
["03:10,400","03:12,200","\"They came from Madonna. That was the only one.\""]
["03:12,200","03:14,080","\"The white one? Yeah, it was a white one.\""]
["03:14,080","03:15,360","\"Yeah, I liked that one.\""]
["03:15,360","03:18,000","\"But that was my only experience with it.\""]
["03:18,000","03:20,340","\"And then I didn't really look into it much further.\""]
["03:20,340","03:25,700","\"I remember it came with a little tiny CD you could put in your computer that would give you information about them.\""]
["03:25,700","03:27,420","\"Yeah, it had little CGI videos on it.\""]
["03:27,420","03:28,080","\"Yeah, you remember.\""]
["03:28,080","03:29,820","\"Yeah, I love the masks were on a wall.\""]
["03:29,820","03:30,420","\"The brown one.\""]
["03:30,420","03:31,380","\"Oh, I'm stupid.\""]
["03:31,380","03:33,700","\"The brown one could kick a rock at the other rocks.\""]
["03:33,700","03:34,100","\"Remember?\""]
["03:34,100","03:36,980","\"And the red one is like fire.\""]
["03:36,980","03:39,180","\"Yes, and the blue ones water.\""]
["03:39,180","03:41,380","\"And that's like their thing that they have an element.\""]
["03:41,380","03:42,420","\"The white ones white people.\""]
["03:42,420","03:44,780","\"I remember wanting the green one, but I never got them.\""]
["03:44,780","03:45,660","\"He was cool.\""]
["03:45,660","03:46,700","\"He had a fun face.\""]
["03:46,700","03:48,220","\"The PS2 game was horrible.\""]
["03:48,220","03:49,540","\"I'm sure it was.\""]
["03:49,540","03:51,140","\"I'm sure Mask of Light was not very good.\""]
["03:51,140","03:53,020","\"Wasn't supposed to be a shooter originally.\""]
["03:53,020","03:53,900","\"Was it? I don't know.\""]
["03:53,900","03:59,020","\"I remember, uh, didn't Game Hut upload a video about Bionicle specifically?\""]
["03:59,020","04:01,740","\"Me. Yeah, he was working on a third person shooter.\""]
["04:01,740","04:03,420","\"Really working there at the time.\""]
["04:03,420","04:04,220","\"I think on that one.\""]
["04:04,220","04:06,460","\"It looked kind of like like a Gears of War kind of game.\""]
["04:06,460","04:09,780","\"But with Lego, I hear a game saw.\""]
["04:09,780","04:10,860","\"I think he's getting closer.\""]
["04:10,860","04:12,340","\"He's not.\""]
["04:12,340","04:13,260","\"You probably hear it.\""]
["04:13,260","04:14,660","\"That guy was pointing and warning you.\""]

["04:23,020","04:25,880","\"How many different ancient ruins are there in this area?\""]
["04:25,880","04:31,480","\"All connected to this castle. I don't know it's a very uh vibrant uh, you know\""]
["04:31,480","04:34,320","\"Area is this meant to be Moorish?\""]
["04:34,320","04:39,020","\"No, I don't think so. This is like a sandy\""]
["04:39,020","04:41,520","\"Spain\""]
["04:41,520","04:45,420","\"Oops it isn't Spain there you go nice\""]
["04:45,420","04:50,420","\"This is the most wonderful thing a man can talk to me.\""]

["04:53,420","04:55,420","\"No, he's in that room over.\""]
["04:55,420","04:56,420","\"Oh, you're right.\""]
["04:56,420","04:58,420","\"I see we're getting closer to him.\""]
["04:58,420","04:59,420","\"He's just kind of stuck in there.\""]
["04:59,420","05:00,420","\"He's not very smart.\""]
["05:00,420","05:03,420","\"There is a ladder there, but he doesn't know how to use it.\""]
["05:03,420","05:05,420","\"No, doesn't count.\""]
["05:05,420","05:06,420","\"Oh, you got it.\""]
["05:06,420","05:08,420","\"He doesn't even know he's dying.\""]

["06:04,240","06:08,960","\"There were there was a second one they got revealed like that too. I'm actually happy about this\""]
["06:08,960","06:14,460","\"This then a an official leopard at sequel or is it like the so it's like the\""]
["06:14,460","06:20,840","\"Jetset radio sequel that isn't Jetset radio. That's different because that isn't\""]

["06:38,980","06:40,720","\"I'm happy, uh...\""]
["06:40,720","06:45,680","\"Teams who want to make these things and can't make these things anymore got together to make them any ways.\""]
["06:45,680","06:49,160","\"Even when people told them not to, or just were not going to fund it.\""]
["06:49,160","06:52,580","\"It's nice seeing people make the things they've wanted to make for a long time.\""]
["06:52,580","06:57,100","\"Or just getting, uh, something in the same speed against that don't have sequels anymore.\""]

["06:58,100","07:02,500","\"I will say that Bomb Rush Cyberpunk game looks, uh...\""]
["07:02,500","07:10,100","\"I think that's the name of it. I always forget the name, but it looks like the best sequel jetset radio could ever get and that's even if\""]
["07:10,100","07:15,780","\"Sega were to make an official sequel. I think this looks a lot more fun. You're so think I'm really interested in seeing what you can do\""]

["07:46,580","07:50,100","\"Windows called Mario\""]
["07:50,100","07:56,980","\"I know it's a little confusing because every Mario game is titled like garbage\""]
["07:56,980","08:03,000","\"It was also a joke at my own expense. I'm really bad at that game. I know you told us. Oh, you're talking about 3d world\""]
["08:03,000","08:07,380","\"Yeah, I got confused because he said land and then I was like is he talking about land?\""]
["08:07,380","08:11,820","\"Is he talking about Bowser's theory the game's on best that I don't know. Let me think\""]

["08:44,300","08:52,140","\"I'm really good at flying plane games. How about pub G. I know you love not good at that at all really you played it for years\""]

["09:00,100","09:06,100","\"You don't really necessarily want to be good at I just kind of play it to talk to people at least it was less janky the last time\""]
["09:06,100","09:10,200","\"I played it because yeah when it first came out. I had zero interest in it because it barely worked\""]
["09:10,200","09:17,120","\"Wasn't like unplayable when it got ported to Xbox like it ran at 10 frames per second or something. Oh\""]
["09:17,120","09:22,900","\"I figured there would be just stop on me. Yeah, you stomp on them. Oh my god. That should be\""]

["09:41,140","09:46,020","\"But we do if you were being impaled through your head. How would you react?\""]
["09:46,020","09:51,220","\"I'd like how would you react? I'd be in pailor and be like why why would you do this?\""]
["09:51,700","09:54,820","\"That he'd be like hmm. I'm thinking about why I\""]
["09:54,820","09:57,600","\"Know your brain you go peanut boy\""]
["09:57,600","10:06,160","\"Do I really think that the fact that that could possibly happen is really evil and mean it is of God to design us and stay away\""]

["10:12,280","10:16,600","\"Yeah, he made it so that if your brain gets scrambled you'd say and do horribly weird things\""]
["10:16,600","10:19,780","\"Yeah, but that's why it's why your skull is nice and hard\""]

["10:46,660","10:53,680","\"Let me think there's a spike coming down from the ceiling through my head. This is like the Final Fantasy 7 roller coaster\""]
