["00:35,240","00:40,760","\"That's what I'm saying frames that I mean I did have a one friend who was obsessed with altered bees\""]
["00:40,760","00:45,440","\"But I still don't think that that's a frame of a poster at frame the shinobi one for sure\""]

["01:41,500","01:43,500","\"That would be that equals pull\""]

["01:52,840","01:58,640","\"Since it came with the expansion cartridge you could take sonic and knuckles and plug it to sonic one and sonic two to play knuckles in those games\""]
["01:58,640","01:59,600","\"That's cool\""]
["01:59,600","02:06,080","\"Yeah, if you had any official like Sega games you could play blue spheres and certain games made it go like special ones\""]
["02:06,080","02:10,320","\"So like most sonic games have like special ones you could play well\""]
["02:10,320","02:17,360","\"Like Sonic 3d blast and shit. Yeah, I was I was talking to Corey before like I remember going to like a friend's house\""]
["02:17,360","02:22,360","\"And waking up at like six in the morning before they get up and just to like play more on their Genesis\""]
["02:22,360","02:28,080","\"And I would just like I spent an entire morning once just plugging random\""]
["02:28,080","02:33,960","\"Games into Sonic and Knuckles and playing the little blue spheres game. Yeah, it's fun as hell\""]

["03:02,820","03:10,320","\"I keep forgetting that this game doesn't have drop dashes. I should go through that because it gives you a special\""]
["03:10,320","03:16,760","\"Wait, what game introduced drop dashes? I thought it was to me mania, but it's like I'm so used to doing it all the time\""]
["03:16,760","03:18,760","\"It is a cool move honestly\""]
["03:18,880","03:24,480","\"Want to go up good thing I went down Tomara. How did they simulate real water back then? How did they do that?\""]
["03:24,480","03:26,880","\"They poured it into the Sega Genesis\""]
["03:26,880","03:34,120","\"Each cartridge ship with a water expansion like in Sonic 1 you were just green, but in this one you're like teal. Oh shit\""]

["03:54,160","03:55,160","\"I'm sorry!\""]
["03:55,160","03:57,760","\"This is what little kids felt like when their brothers wouldn't let them play.\""]
["03:57,760","03:59,560","\"That's exactly how I treated my little brother.\""]
["03:59,560","04:01,760","\"This is what it's supposed to be like to be Tails, Chris.\""]
["04:01,760","04:02,760","\"Ow, it hurts.\""]
["04:02,760","04:07,160","\"It's what every silly cartoon about Sonic the Hedgehog has ever taught us.\""]
["04:07,160","04:08,160","\"You're so right.\""]
["04:08,160","04:09,160","\"This is every dorkly.\""]

["04:14,960","04:18,960","\"All you can do is follow me and my way can be super weak compared to me.\""]
["04:18,960","04:21,960","\"I've seen you. I've seen you as Tails before, Chris.\""]
["04:21,960","04:24,960","\"Last time you played as Tails was in Second Life.\""]
["04:24,960","04:26,960","\"Oh my God! I played femtails.\""]
["04:26,960","04:28,960","\"That Tails in Second Life is hot.\""]
["04:28,960","04:31,960","\"You have to admit that to him.\""]

["04:33,960","04:35,960","\"You son of a bitch.\""]
["04:35,960","04:38,960","\"You sidesteped that so well.\""]

["04:39,960","04:40,960","\"Hmm?\""]
["04:40,960","04:45,960","\"I'm just trying to make Tomer look like a furry but he made me look like one instead.\""]
["04:45,960","04:50,640","\"I hate it when you do that Tomer.\""]
["04:50,640","04:51,640","\"I love blue series.\""]
["04:51,640","04:52,640","\"It's so fun.\""]
["04:52,640","04:57,280","\"Except when I get slightly faster then I lose my mind because it's fucking scary.\""]
["04:57,280","04:59,320","\"I wonder if this has a delay to it.\""]
["04:59,320","05:01,560","\"Kind of does.\""]
["05:01,560","05:04,720","\"This is the funnest thing I've ever seen in my entire life, Corey.\""]
["05:04,720","05:05,720","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:05,720","05:06,720","\"No.\""]
["05:06,720","05:07,720","\"Wait, hold on.\""]
["05:07,720","05:08,720","\"Let me get all the things.\""]
["05:08,720","05:12,160","\"Okay, now you're so big. Yeah, I get faster\""]
["05:12,160","05:14,680","\"So the blue symbolizes\""]
["05:14,680","05:17,800","\"Yeah, the more you collect the faster it is\""]
["05:17,800","05:22,000","\"Signifies not dying the red is death. That's fair. No. Oh\""]
["05:22,000","05:29,400","\"You can't clear that one now wait, maybe you can you can I can't get all the rings though. No, it'll clear\""]
["05:29,400","05:31,840","\"Oh, no. Yeah, all the red ones don't change\""]
["05:33,120","05:38,760","\"We're still being out. He can't perfect the level now. I want to control tails in this scenario\""]
["05:38,760","05:43,120","\"We should play Sonic 3D Blast the best Sonic game. I got an emerald\""]
["05:43,120","05:49,600","\"Sonic 3D Blast is good. No, it's not. I had that one growing up. Oh, you banged your fat head\""]
["05:49,600","05:57,200","\"Blood trailing down. Sorry. I might have gotten to continue. Do you think you can get all the KSM rules Corey?\""]
["05:57,200","06:02,080","\"I'd love to see I want to because then I can become hypersonic. I was a 14. This is the game\""]
["06:02,640","06:08,360","\"Sonic I'll try and get all the emeralds. Yeah, I can do it you only need seven to be supersonic, right?\""]
["06:08,360","06:12,920","\"I'll have to when we beat the game. We'll have to go back to previous levels because all the rings get unlocked again\""]
["06:12,920","06:14,920","\"So unlike Sonic Knuckles\""]
["06:14,920","06:17,680","\"Yeah\""]
["06:17,680","06:19,680","\"Isn't the\""]
["06:19,680","06:26,840","\"No, he is one, but he he's just a smaller jumper and he can he has an alternate path\""]
["06:26,840","06:30,920","\"He is a smaller jumper he can climb up walls. Yeah, he doesn't jump as high as sonic\""]
["06:31,120","06:36,020","\"He has a smaller jumper than Sonic their for as a loser. Yeah, he has a little jumper. See look now\""]
["06:36,020","06:38,020","\"I'm kicking ass\""]
["06:38,020","06:40,860","\"You gotta keep up with the big brother tails\""]
["06:40,860","06:49,200","\"Tells is a fucking idiot. Yeah, you just triggered something. I don't know what it is. Let the forest on fire. Here I am\""]
["06:49,200","06:57,000","\"Sonic Sonic come up. Come up. Sonic. Wait for me. Wait, come on. Come on. Come on. Look at me. Oh\""]
["06:58,720","07:02,420","\"Chris, can you sing us the tales theme from Sonic Adventure?\""]
["07:02,420","07:03,420","\"Oh, I can't go up there.\""]
["07:03,420","07:04,420","\"Which one? First game?\""]
["07:04,420","07:05,420","\"Oh wait, Chris.\""]
["07:05,420","07:08,620","\"No one that's like, \"\"Chris, there you go, yeah, come here, come here.\"\"\""]
["07:08,620","07:09,620","\"Oh shit.\""]
["07:09,620","07:10,620","\"Nice, good job.\""]
["07:10,620","07:12,620","\"I want it, sir.\""]
["07:12,620","07:13,820","\"We went on another route.\""]
["07:13,820","07:14,820","\"Oh no!\""]
["07:14,820","07:19,620","\"That's the one I don't really remember that well.\""]
["07:19,620","07:23,420","\"I like listen to all the music in that game when it came out like a billion times.\""]
["07:23,420","07:25,020","\"Does that sound like two or one?\""]
["07:25,020","07:26,020","\"That's Sonic Adventure one.\""]
["07:26,020","07:28,620","\"I don't know why I remember that from the other one.\""]
["07:28,620","07:35,140","\"I venture to Thomas sing live and learn from start to finish go. I don't know the lyrics\""]
["07:35,140","07:48,820","\"Yeah, I like I like the recent concert\""]
["07:48,820","07:53,600","\"They had a guy to whatever singing like Sonic Heroes and they give the guy the mic and he's like\""]
["07:53,600","08:09,780","\"It was like the funniest thing if I lost my mind when I think I told me once that's how he writes his songs\""]
["08:09,780","08:13,680","\"He starts off just screaming gibberish and he adds lyrics later. That's how you do it\""]
["08:13,680","08:16,920","\"It's a great way to do it if you listen to the Sonic Heroes man. He's like\""]
["08:16,920","08:20,920","\"*sings*\""]
["08:20,920","08:23,920","\"Yeah, that's literally how he does it. It's actually kind of genius.\""]
["08:23,920","08:26,920","\"It is really smart because you get the idea of the rhythm in your head.\""]
["08:26,920","08:30,920","\"I've never considered that sub like beat scouting or pop scouting.\""]
["08:30,920","08:33,920","\"I'm really bad at writing lyrics so that's probably the best thing I could do too.\""]
["08:33,920","08:36,920","\"It's smart though because you understand the rhythm in your head like how you want it to be.\""]
["08:36,920","08:39,920","\"That would have trapped me. I would have thought they were going to disappear.\""]
["08:39,920","08:41,920","\"I forgot they have to be filled in.\""]
["08:41,920","08:45,920","\"And that's why Corey's playing an age you're not.\""]
["08:45,920","08:53,200","\"I got confused you didn't get the chaos gem I have about 24 chances and I'm not gonna get like half of them\""]
["08:53,200","08:59,840","\"Not a well, that's kind of mean actually what do you mean? There's not a chance you'll get a bitch\""]
["08:59,840","09:07,940","\"There's a chance a little bit here. Yeah, I hope you just get a nice come on here. Take me up\""]
["09:07,940","09:10,580","\"Cowboy jump up\""]

["09:13,440","09:17,960","\"What am I doing here talking about it? I can do that yeah, yeah\""]
["09:17,960","09:28,720","\"Give it you can take me out of the towel okay, okay, okay carry me out this hurts. I know where can I bring you to over here?\""]
["09:28,720","09:39,540","\"Dude plan his tails is the most fun I've ever had in my life. That's that's exactly how little brother feels\""]

["09:41,540","09:43,540","\"Every time you fall off screen\""]
["09:43,540","09:46,540","\"I was like, \"\"Wow, I really play a good Sonic!\"\"\""]
["09:46,540","09:48,540","\"Oh wow, look there he goes\""]
["09:48,540","09:49,540","\"What?\""]
["09:49,540","09:50,540","\"That's Sonic!\""]
["09:50,540","09:51,540","\"Who's up?\""]
["09:51,540","09:52,540","\"*laughing*\""]
["09:52,540","09:53,540","\"Bonus stage\""]
["09:53,540","09:54,540","\"I gotta get the bonus\""]
["09:54,540","09:58,540","\"If you have a certain amount of rings you jump in the little thing above the shadow point\""]
["09:58,540","09:59,540","\"Yeah, you get a ton\""]
["09:59,540","10:01,540","\"Ah, let's play Sonic's spin ball\""]
["10:01,540","10:02,540","\"We should\""]
["10:02,540","10:04,540","\"It's probably less fun than this\""]
["10:04,540","10:07,540","\"It is, but I think it has the coolest aesthetic\""]
["10:07,540","10:09,980","\"Oh come on! I loved it as a kid, but...\""]
["10:09,980","10:11,140","\"I couldn't reach that!\""]
["10:11,140","10:14,340","\"It's got the scary Eggman aesthetic from sad am and I like that.\""]
["10:14,340","10:15,700","\"I like that too.\""]
["10:15,700","10:23,100","\"I always thought that opening shot of him flying towards the island that's made out of like robot looks really scary.\""]
["10:23,100","10:24,780","\"I love this if you don't touch anything.\""]
["10:24,780","10:25,420","\"Was that game made?\""]
["10:25,420","10:29,500","\"Tales of Kids dropped by like the K-bomb or he's just dropping bombs any at all times.\""]
["10:29,500","10:32,140","\"Did that game actually have references to the show?\""]
["10:32,140","10:34,700","\"I think Eggman in that game was from the show.\""]
["10:34,700","10:40,460","\"Oh, like he looked like the really scary one that was the voice of Winnie the Pooh.\""]
["10:40,460","10:41,500","\"Wait, Jim Cummings?\""]
["10:41,500","10:43,020","\"Jim Cummings, yeah.\""]
