["00:00,000","00:02,000","\"Have you bought any games of this?\""]
["00:02,000","00:03,300","\"It comes with them all.\""]
["00:03,300","00:04,200","\"Does it really?\""]
["00:04,200","00:04,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:04,700","00:05,900","\"Bizarre.\""]
["00:05,900","00:08,300","\"I had to buy every individual game and then install it.\""]
["00:08,300","00:10,200","\"No, you nasty idiot.\""]
["00:10,200","00:10,900","\"Oh.\""]
["00:10,900","00:14,100","\"I guess I'm unfortunately confused.\""]
["00:14,100","00:17,300","\"Oh, they play!\""]
["00:17,300","00:19,500","\"With friends.\""]
["00:19,500","00:21,400","\"Oh, Jesus!\""]
["00:21,400","00:22,400","\"Christ!\""]
["00:22,400","00:23,400","\"Jesus!\""]
["00:23,400","00:24,600","\"Just like Sega.\""]
["00:24,600","00:25,400","\"That hurt.\""]
["00:25,400","00:26,200","\"Oh, let's watch this.\""]
["00:26,200","00:28,400","\"Let's get invested in Sega from the 90s.\""]
["00:28,400","00:29,600","\"Oh, that woke me up.\""]
["00:29,600","00:38,240","\"Oh, he's okay. Oh dude, this has streets of rage on it. Yeah, it also has gold mats. Yeah\""]
["00:38,240","00:42,900","\"Look at those gun star men Corey\""]
["00:42,900","00:47,620","\"Awkward those are the awkward characters\""]
["00:47,620","00:53,100","\"It's really boring you walk around and collect things\""]
["00:53,100","00:58,280","\"It's kind of like an isometric almost like a like a Zelda sort of perspective\""]
["00:58,280","01:01,080","\"I feel like most people who like it only like it because of the music.\""]
["01:01,080","01:02,280","\"This is a weird funkiness.\""]
["01:02,280","01:04,480","\"Or you know what I'd maybe compare it to?\""]
["01:04,480","01:07,580","\"Did you ever play that goof troop game for the Super Nintendo?\""]
["01:07,580","01:08,280","\"No.\""]
["01:08,280","01:09,080","\"Okay, never mind.\""]
["01:09,080","01:10,780","\"I don't know what I'd compare it to then.\""]
["01:10,780","01:12,280","\"I don't know.\""]
["01:12,280","01:13,780","\"I'm just looking at my toy story room.\""]
["01:13,780","01:16,780","\"This brings me back.\""]
["01:16,780","01:21,280","\"Kori, you gotta waddle around on your little legs into your little child bed.\""]
["01:21,280","01:24,780","\"I'm like the Terminator though because I have all these options I can see before me.\""]
["01:24,780","01:25,980","\"Most people can't see this.\""]
["01:25,980","01:27,680","\"It's like a Google smart glasses.\""]
["01:27,680","01:28,580","\"You got your little.\""]
["01:28,580","01:33,180","\"What is the game? Oh, I was Chris.\""]
["01:33,180","01:34,840","\"Corey was right. Chris.\""]
["01:34,840","01:36,240","\"Huh? Holy.\""]
["01:36,240","01:38,560","\"Chris. You must feel like an idiot.\""]
["01:38,560","01:41,180","\"What was it? Chris, Corey, once again.\""]
["01:41,180","01:43,240","\"What did he do? Once again is correct.\""]
["01:43,240","01:45,720","\"Look, we don't have any games.\""]
["01:45,720","01:49,600","\"You do need to buy all the games and then install it as DLC.\""]
["01:49,600","01:51,520","\"Are you sure? I'm pretty sure.\""]
["01:51,520","01:53,920","\"This is a fun video game.\""]
["01:53,920","01:57,400","\"Big fan. I'm really enjoying it.\""]
["01:57,400","02:04,680","\"Now you're my friend Dominic from the 90s whose parents were divorced and got two Christmases.\""]
["02:04,680","02:06,280","\"Look at all those games.\""]
["02:06,280","02:08,520","\"Let's pop this sucker in just like in real life.\""]
["02:08,520","02:09,640","\"It comes out of the wood.\""]
["02:09,640","02:10,120","\"All right.\""]
["02:10,120","02:11,640","\"TV, shut it up.\""]
["02:11,640","02:13,880","\"We're going to need maximum Corey on this.\""]
["02:13,880","02:17,080","\"We need to bring it.\""]
["02:17,080","02:18,360","\"I love this game.\""]
["02:18,360","02:19,880","\"I haven't played in a while.\""]
["02:19,880","02:21,960","\"So how long has that love been there?\""]
["02:21,960","02:23,960","\"Wait, who the fuck's that orange idiot?\""]
["02:23,960","02:25,480","\"It's Knuckles.\""]
["02:25,480","02:30,360","\"Okay, can I just say I never played this one as a kid. I only played one which is the worst one apparently\""]
["02:30,360","02:37,020","\"But everyone knows this fucking song a little laggy is it yeah, I also like this like virtual\""]
["02:37,020","02:43,700","\"Wall the grid the second grid. I love that thing. It's crazy. It makes you feel like I'm actually inside the TV\""]
["02:43,700","02:49,960","\"Yeah, but don't go beyond it. Is it actually laggy in what way? It's just a little laggy. Oh, it's probably the emu\""]
["02:49,960","02:53,040","\"- Let me get this little shoe here.\""]
["02:53,040","02:55,680","\"When I hit the spring.\""]
["02:55,680","02:56,840","\"- Okay, I just wanna make a joke.\""]
["02:56,840","02:58,080","\"Like when he gets that shoe,\""]
["02:58,080","03:00,480","\"it's almost like he's on crack or speed.\""]
["03:00,480","03:01,320","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:01,320","03:02,160","\"- That's really true.\""]
["03:02,160","03:03,720","\"It's almost like he's doing some kind of hardcore,\""]
["03:03,720","03:05,400","\"like a legal drug of some sort.\""]
["03:05,400","03:08,360","\"That is inherently just a hilarious concept.\""]
["03:08,360","03:10,160","\"- I was just trying to drop that.\""]
["03:10,160","03:14,000","\"- No, but you know, I'm kind of glad I never played\""]
["03:14,000","03:17,800","\"this as a kid 'cause it would have unleashed my full autism.\""]
["03:17,800","03:19,200","\"- Oh, I love this game.\""]
["03:19,200","03:21,600","\"This would have gotten me absolutely hooked forever.\""]
["03:21,600","03:23,480","\"Yeah, I beat it so many times.\""]
["03:23,480","03:26,580","\"Actually, what's funny is this game's kind of ruthless for the last boss.\""]
["03:26,580","03:27,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:27,080","03:30,720","\"Kind of like throws you at the wolves and then the wolves eat the remains.\""]
["03:30,720","03:34,040","\"Because it's like they expect a lot from you as a kid towards the end.\""]
["03:34,040","03:35,200","\"Because you're kind of like...\""]
["03:35,200","03:36,520","\"They kind of like...\""]
["03:36,520","03:39,800","\"Once you get to it, you're like, \"\"I can do anything. I can take on the world.\"\"\""]
["03:39,800","03:42,280","\"And then they remove your source of life.\""]
["03:42,280","03:43,800","\"They're like, \"\"Oh, you need rings?\"\"\""]
["03:43,800","03:46,880","\"\"\"Well, be sure to make you fight two bosses and then fucking...\""]
["03:47,320","03:51,600","\"Have fun with no rings. So as a kid you're like your heart's breathing\""]
["03:51,600","04:04,800","\"This game's awesome also Chris I don't think that this would have like unlocked your full potential of I\""]
["04:04,800","04:11,400","\"Don't think these are the games that do it because these are just whatever that I think this is the game that did it to most people\""]
["04:11,680","04:18,360","\"No, I think it's more the later ones where Sonic starts like fighting the military and characters start like giving speeches about\""]
["04:18,360","04:24,600","\"I don't think that happens until like kind of the Sonic adventure era where they're they try to be like\""]
["04:24,600","04:32,220","\"Sonic is cool. Sonic is Sonic is what saves the world Sonic Sonic fights wars\""]
["04:32,220","04:35,260","\"Yeah, right, but no, I think this is still the game\""]
["04:35,260","04:38,980","\"So okay, there's the thing about Sonic one is everyone wants to like Sonic\""]
["04:38,980","04:45,040","\"But Sonic 1 is so boring and shit that no one ever actually really completes it that much. Yeah, Sonic 1 is boring\""]
["04:45,040","04:48,220","\"Most kids I know never beat Sonic 1 because it's just so shit to get through\""]
["04:48,220","04:54,180","\"Sonic 1 was like a test and most people agree like they play the first level of Sonic 1 and they're like I love Sonic\""]
["04:54,180","04:56,580","\"Yeah, yeah, so yeah Green Hills. I love Green Hills Green Hills\""]
["04:56,580","05:00,180","\"And then the next level you're like this sucks and then that whole the whole rest of the game is like this sucks\""]
["05:00,180","05:01,460","\"Okay, Corey\""]
["05:01,460","05:04,260","\"Dr. Robotnik is he deep down a good guy?\""]
["05:04,260","05:05,860","\"No, he's an asshole\""]
["05:05,860","05:10,260","\"Well, then how come in Sonic adventure two at the end of the game? He seems like a good guy. It's all rude\""]
["05:10,260","05:12,260","\"They do that a couple times actually\""]
["05:12,260","05:19,740","\"Happens in the first Sonic adventure - he's like I promise I will never be a dick again and then he's immediately a dick again\""]
["05:19,740","05:21,860","\"fucking\""]
["05:21,860","05:23,860","\"trusting\""]
["05:23,860","05:28,580","\"Tails goes to shake his hand. They pull the gun on him. It says nobody follow me\""]
["05:28,580","05:35,380","\"Was a was the spin-dash in Sonic one I know sworn it came in this game\""]
["05:35,380","05:41,500","\"It was this one yeah, yeah, this isn't that's what and that's a thing too is like momentum in Sonic 1 was really like it was all\""]
["05:41,500","05:46,040","\"Trial and error. I think what I was trying to say before is like Sonic 1 started out you do the first level\""]
["05:46,040","05:49,780","\"And you're really into it sorry for me rolling all the time. It's a habit anytime. I see like a\""]
["05:49,780","05:58,100","\"Thing anyone who plays Sonic games knows that once you see a hail you instinctively roll. It's like it's what everybody knows\""]
["05:58,100","06:02,860","\"But so like they did the first level and then they were like we don't want to like wear everybody out\""]
["06:02,860","06:05,340","\"We give them like an endorphin thing and then they're ready to go\""]
["06:05,340","06:10,260","\"So let's slow it down to a crawl with the next level where you have to wait for blocks over lava\""]
["06:10,260","06:15,860","\"And then they pick it up again because you do the casino stage and then it's the worst stage ever labyrinth zone and\""]
["06:15,860","06:20,780","\"Then you stop playing the game because you hate it. Okay, that's fair\""]
["06:20,780","06:23,220","\"That's basically how you play Sonic the Hedgehog by the way\""]
["06:23,220","06:29,180","\"I'm not gonna become supersonic because then it would be annoying because I constantly jump jump and become supersonic\""]
["06:29,180","06:32,440","\"'cause if you hold jump, once you have 50 rings,\""]
["06:32,440","06:33,620","\"you become supersonic.\""]
["06:33,620","06:34,700","\"There's like no way to do it.\""]
["06:34,700","06:35,900","\"In all the new games that come out,\""]
["06:35,900","06:38,140","\"you have to press a button to instinctively do it.\""]
["06:38,140","06:41,500","\"- Okay, well, Lyle, yes, my friend.\""]
["06:41,500","06:45,140","\"If you were to make a good Sonic game, how would you do it?\""]
["06:45,140","06:47,420","\"Well, the first thing, it would start with a quote\""]
["06:47,420","06:49,980","\"from Broke Spinoza.\""]
["06:49,980","06:51,080","\"- I thought you were saying\""]
["06:51,080","06:53,460","\"I'm a brook. - Broke Spinoza?\""]
["06:53,460","06:55,220","\"- Yeah. - Fat dog Mendoza?\""]
["06:55,220","06:56,060","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:56,060","06:58,780","\"- I think just like involving philosophy in Sonic\""]
["06:58,780","07:03,420","\"would be a good idea. Sonic would say, what does life even mean?\""]
["07:03,420","07:06,260","\"You look off into the distance and then,\""]
["07:06,260","07:08,580","\"spoiler alert, Dark Sonic, right?\""]
["07:08,580","07:10,140","\"He's just ripping off Shadow.\""]
["07:10,140","07:14,580","\"Sonic, but he's, no, no, this is Sonic with these evil.\""]
["07:14,580","07:16,380","\"Okay. It's Dark Sonic.\""]
["07:16,380","07:18,780","\"Because that's what's cool is when you see a character\""]
["07:18,780","07:20,860","\"and then there's another character that's exactly like him.\""]
["07:20,860","07:23,180","\"Everyone thinks Dark Sonic is Sonic.\""]
["07:23,180","07:25,620","\"All right, this isn't Shadow, but it's Dark Sonic.\""]
["07:25,620","07:26,420","\"Okay, low.\""]
["07:26,420","07:27,580","\"And the Dark Sonic.\""]
["07:27,580","07:28,420","\"- He has your hair.\""]
["07:28,420","07:29,780","\"- He marries Amy.\""]
["07:29,780","07:32,020","\"- And he has, yeah, he has my hair.\""]
["07:32,020","07:34,100","\"And then Amy gets pregnant with Dark Sonic's baby.\""]
["07:34,100","07:35,620","\"- Does he also have tattoos?\""]
["07:35,620","07:36,460","\"- Yes.\""]
["07:36,460","07:37,820","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:37,820","07:39,100","\"- Does he have a fan of Jack Daniel?\""]
["07:39,100","07:39,940","\"- Yes.\""]
["07:39,940","07:40,780","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:40,780","07:41,620","\"- Okay.\""]
["07:41,620","07:44,260","\"- And then Dark Sonic looks right at the camera\""]
["07:44,260","07:46,460","\"and says, \"\"Your dad was wrong about you.\"\"\""]
["07:46,460","07:48,220","\"And that's the video game.\""]
["07:48,220","07:49,060","\"- That's fucking awesome.\""]
["07:49,060","07:50,740","\"- That sucks them off when that's over.\""]
["07:50,740","07:51,900","\"- I knew that, that would be cool.\""]
["07:51,900","07:52,740","\"- No!\""]
["07:52,740","07:53,580","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:53,580","07:54,420","\"- Oh shit.\""]
["07:54,420","07:55,620","\"- He tails is dead now.\""]
["07:55,620","07:57,340","\"- You dropped him into Purple Acid.\""]
["07:57,340","07:59,300","\"- Yeah, he's never gonna be the same.\""]
["07:59,300","08:00,500","\"- It's all right.\""]
["08:00,500","08:02,620","\"Kinda sucks as a character in this.\""]
["08:02,620","08:04,980","\"He's just sorta like a puppet that you scroll around\""]
["08:04,980","08:06,260","\"when every time he comes in from flying,\""]
["08:06,260","08:08,140","\"he's usually falling to his death a second later.\""]
["08:08,140","08:09,940","\"- Well, he got out, but that probably took\""]
["08:09,940","08:12,180","\"like a year and a half off his lifespan.\""]
["08:12,180","08:13,020","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:13,020","08:13,840","\"- Of course.\""]
["08:13,840","08:14,660","\"- If 53 is gonna go to the doctor\""]
["08:14,660","08:17,260","\"and find out he's got like heart issues 'cause of that.\""]
["08:17,260","08:18,100","\"- What's up?\""]
["08:18,100","08:20,980","\"- Cory, make a dorkly cartoon about Sonic right now.\""]
["08:20,980","08:21,980","\"- A dorkly cartoon?\""]
["08:21,980","08:22,900","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:22,900","08:24,860","\"- Okay, well, Tails is trying to be his friend\""]
["08:24,860","08:27,300","\"and he's just like, \"\"Tails, have you paid rent yet?\"\"\""]
["08:27,300","08:34,340","\"Is that kind of like how it is and then he's just like no you're missing the entire point of dorkley actually if I'm trying to think right dorkley\""]
["08:34,340","08:37,360","\"They did sonic for hire. Yeah, I'm not sure actually\""]
["08:37,360","08:44,060","\"Sure it sure does seem the same you're right well if you want to know what they would do is a sonic parody look up sonic for hire\""]
["08:44,060","08:46,060","\"He basically that's all it was\""]
["08:46,060","08:50,700","\"I think now because machinima as a whole is gone. Yeah, they liquidated\""]
["08:50,700","08:58,600","\"Darkly still around. No, what Darkly does is that they'll take a really really obvious video game observation and be like like tails can't die\""]
["08:58,600","09:01,780","\"You always come back. Sonic's on speed. Yeah, it'll be like that\""]
["09:01,780","09:04,920","\"But there was one episode was like oh tails you're dead\""]
["09:04,920","09:10,860","\"Excuse me. I'm like actually I'm still alive what you're immortal and then the rest of the cartoon is about him being immortal\""]
["09:10,860","09:12,860","\"I mean, that's a dorkly idea\""]
["09:12,860","09:18,420","\"That's the guy from the cartoon. Oh, yeah, except he's not green grounder. Yeah\""]
["09:19,020","09:24,000","\"Mm-hmm is the chicken in this scratch that I don't think he is\""]
["09:24,000","09:26,960","\"Know that's scrappy as he\""]
["09:26,960","09:34,340","\"Has he ever been in a sonic game the chicken man? I don't know he must have been I don't know\""]
["09:34,340","09:39,360","\"I don't think you know I think it was not Corey. He was only for adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\""]
["09:39,360","09:44,060","\"This is the part by the way you have to ride these things or else you'll be fucked. There's an easier way to do it\""]
["09:45,300","09:51,620","\"Dude, Grandr was this Patrick star in a robot suit there. I skipped it. You really done it now Corey. I'll play don't die\""]
["09:51,620","10:01,860","\"This is the maximum Corey. I wanted this levels pretty I'll give it that music rocks. Oh, no. Oh fuck\""]

["17:46,480","17:51,740","\"That fucking info is sunken in and it can't come out now. Well, it's it's hard pressed in\""]
["17:51,740","17:56,940","\"I can't help it either there. I guess there's ways to diverge it. I heard the N word so often on the radio\""]

["18:01,160","18:10,720","\"Excuse me Chris. I was watching the invention of lying with Ricky Jervis. Yeah\""]
["18:10,720","18:14,160","\"Yeah, and there's like a part where they basically just insult him for being gay\""]
["18:14,160","18:18,040","\"Well, they imply that he's gay. Yeah, they call him like\""]
["18:18,040","18:20,320","\"You know you can quote me here\""]
["18:20,320","18:24,080","\"They call him as like a chubby little queer and then they and then like the lady\""]
["18:24,080","18:28,760","\"Like you can edit this down obviously with the lady goes like I didn't call you a chubby little queer\""]
["18:28,760","18:30,760","\"I called you a fat\""]
["18:30,760","18:36,720","\"That's funny and I couldn't believe it\""]
["18:37,240","18:40,800","\"Well, yeah, that's in that came out in the 90s. That was 2009\""]
["18:40,800","18:44,540","\"90s didn't give a shit. That's not the 90s\""]
["18:44,540","18:49,640","\"2000 is the 90s\""]
["18:49,640","19:02,880","\"It kind of did no they didn't though the 90s stuck around until like 2010 that's when the 90s that's fucking stupid Corey\""]
["19:02,880","19:09,560","\"It's true though. It's also fact the 90s died when friends went off the air which I believe was yeah like 2008\""]
["19:09,560","19:15,280","\"That's a good point, which is also probably not true. Basically the 90s wasn't dead while Scott was still popular\""]
["19:15,280","19:20,920","\"Yeah, I guess that's fair. I can't believe Scott died and never even made a feeble attempt to come back\""]
["19:20,920","19:24,280","\"It tried but it just seemed like too weird like I'm not into it\""]
["19:24,280","19:27,820","\"But it just seems like something that would still be popular for some reason it doesn't yeah\""]
["19:27,820","19:31,920","\"It doesn't seem like a genre that like it doesn't feel like disco like it can't come back\""]
["19:31,920","19:38,720","\"Yeah, they can survive in like Japan, but I don't think it really has a place here when mumble wrap is like topping the charts. Oh, yeah\""]
["19:38,720","19:42,360","\"I mean, not like topping the judge doesn't need to top the charts\""]
["19:42,360","19:49,380","\"But like metal hasn't been like quote-unquote popular for a really long time, but it's still got a huge undergrowth\""]
["19:49,380","19:54,320","\"So yeah, that's still good, but that's what I mean skies in like one of those genres\""]
["19:54,320","19:59,120","\"That's totally bereft of like what were we thinking? No, it's not it's not industrially\""]
["20:01,120","20:07,440","\"It'll last this people will still come back and listen to it because it's a type of music that's almost like a feeling\""]
["20:07,440","20:10,740","\"I know that sounds really cringy, but yeah, it makes you feel good. Oh\""]
["20:10,740","20:14,240","\"My god pick something up\""]
["20:14,240","20:18,780","\"Shot at him he's gonna he's gonna not like\""]
