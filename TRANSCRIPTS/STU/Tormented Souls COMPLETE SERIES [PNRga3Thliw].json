["06:10,000","06:13,000","\"It's very definitely pronounced wild burger.\""]
["06:13,000","06:14,000","\"I know.\""]
["06:14,000","06:16,000","\"Today is the happiest day of my life.\""]

["06:33,000","06:38,840","\"like she was waking up from a dream. That is not all. Something odd happened when I checked my watch\""]
["06:38,840","06:44,440","\"to find the exact time at which the first baby Emma was born. As I opened the lid, the glass\""]
["06:44,440","06:50,040","\"cracked and the hands utterly stopped. I do not think this event to have some meaning or other.\""]
["06:50,040","06:56,440","\"I'm not a superstitious man, but Maria insisted it is a sign she has started using the hour as\""]

["07:01,080","07:03,080","\"He uh, three. Zero three.\""]
["07:03,080","07:05,080","\"But now you gotta find the watch.\""]

["07:07,080","07:09,560","\"Oh, wait what?\""]
["07:09,560","07:11,560","\"Well, it's probably the combination of that lock.\""]
["07:11,560","07:13,080","\"Yeah, that's what I'm saying.\""]
["07:13,080","07:15,080","\"We just gotta find out what the time is.\""]
["07:15,080","07:16,120","\"Where's the time?\""]
["07:16,120","07:17,320","\"There's something written on the wall over there.\""]

["07:20,200","07:23,320","\"Do not let shadows embrace you.\""]
["07:23,320","07:25,400","\"What does that mean?\""]
["07:25,400","07:27,800","\"Maybe it might be very literal.\""]

["07:29,560","07:30,560","\"Ahh.\""]
["07:30,560","07:31,780","\"Okay.\""]
["07:31,780","07:33,960","\"If a shadow tries to give you a hug,\""]

["07:41,620","07:44,360","\"I was, like, connected to the respirator.\""]
["07:44,360","07:46,200","\"Why didn't they just let me die?\""]
["07:46,200","07:48,360","\"Probably to keep you alive, if you dumb bitch.\""]
["07:48,360","07:51,600","\"Well, you obviously can breathe just fine on your own.\""]
["07:51,600","07:52,600","\"Uh-uh.\""]

["08:54,480","08:57,200","\"That seems to be the case\""]
["08:57,920","09:04,240","\"I'm stupid. That's right. It can be modified. Yeah, this game wants to teach you how you can like open stuff in your inventory and\""]
["09:04,240","09:11,440","\"wait really and mess with it so you've got to get it. I feel like that's good. Yeah, I feel like there's no more adjustment needed\""]
["09:11,440","09:15,120","\"Thanks, lol\""]
["09:15,120","09:17,920","\"Yeah, look at me go. Oh\""]

["09:27,120","09:32,600","\"I mean lots of people have a lighter but in here I don't know if that makes you special. It's a zippo look\""]
["09:32,600","09:36,200","\"I can shit into this even even a baby had a lighter. That's what you got it from\""]
["09:36,200","09:41,580","\"It was a baby's lighter. It was a baby's lighter that baby that baby smokes\""]
["09:41,580","09:47,660","\"That baby is gonna be so much cooler than you in high school and so much better than you at 30\""]

["10:28,120","10:30,120","\"Why is that racist? Why is that racist?\""]
["10:30,120","10:38,120","\"The Tismets tribe. If I called you a fucking Tismet you wouldn't be too happy. Sounds like an autism joke. You're a Tismet. That's so cool.\""]
