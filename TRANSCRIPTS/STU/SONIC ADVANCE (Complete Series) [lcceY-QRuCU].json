["00:15,360","00:16,920","\"It looks great on this huge TV.\""]
["00:16,920","00:19,940","\"Hold on, there's probably might can't go up, for some reason.\""]
["00:19,940","00:20,820","\"*laughing*\""]
["00:20,820","00:23,300","\"Uh...\""]

["00:27,440","00:28,960","\"I'm ready to go super Sonic speed.\""]
["00:28,960","00:33,960","\"This is Sonic Advance 1, I thought Sonic Advance 2 started in Green Grove or whatever the fuck.\""]
["00:33,960","00:38,580","\"Man, this is nostalgic, but you know something?\""]
["00:38,580","00:42,060","\"I remember when I bought this, I was really annoyed at the level design, I wonder...\""]
["00:42,060","00:43,060","\"I wonder why.\""]
["00:43,060","00:44,760","\"I wonder was I right.\""]
["00:44,760","00:47,760","\"Look, when you're running, he's to the right of the screen.\""]
["00:47,760","00:48,760","\"Yeah, why?\""]
["00:48,760","00:49,760","\"His placement is weird.\""]
["00:49,760","00:50,760","\"I don't know, it's strange.\""]
["00:50,760","00:53,680","\"It should be leaving room to see what's ahead of you.\""]
["00:53,680","00:56,320","\"See that, Sonic, oh I fucked it up.\""]
["00:56,320","00:58,320","\"You run at the edge of the base of a thing\""]
["00:58,320","01:02,160","\"Whoa, dude\""]
["01:02,160","01:08,200","\"You didn't so fun. You didn't get the frickin checkpoint. You're right. You're so right frickin frick\""]
["01:08,200","01:18,080","\"Can you like drop dash in this game, I don't know you tell me you have to I don't know they invented that by now\""]
["01:18,080","01:23,000","\"Oh, yeah, oh no drop dash was mania. What the fuck am I saying wait? What are you talking about drop dash?\""]
["01:23,000","01:29,060","\"See that shit dude when you jump at the bed okay again when you jump at the base while you're going just before you hit the edge\""]
["01:29,060","01:34,140","\"And you jump you gain more speed. That's a that's a sonic fan tip tip trick\""]
["01:34,140","01:40,460","\"There we go done Corey that kick - dude. Yeah, it was fun. You are the fastest thing alive\""]
["01:40,460","01:42,560","\"It's true. That's playing his tails\""]
["01:42,560","01:47,900","\"I'd be the slightly second fastest thing and I've probably died his tails faster than Knuckles and Canon I\""]
["01:47,900","01:50,000","\"Think so\""]
["01:50,000","01:54,840","\"Because well, you know spoilers, but in the movie\""]
["01:54,840","02:00,080","\"Knuckles wasn't as fast. Oh, yeah, just hit everything idiot\""]
["02:00,080","02:07,220","\"But how come in Sonic heroes they can all run at the exact same speed tell me that huh because like if Sonic and if\""]
["02:07,220","02:10,700","\"Tails and Knuckles are falling behind it would be really boring. That'd be fun\""]
["02:10,700","02:15,540","\"You would switch to Knuckles and Tails and they'd be like falling into the water and fucking like\""]
["02:16,720","02:21,900","\"Maybe out of breath and like their eyes would be pink you know something that's kind of interesting about Knuckles as\""]
["02:21,900","02:26,420","\"Originally his name was Tuckles and that wasn't supposed to be a tale. Yeah, it was like Buffalo Bill\""]
["02:26,420","02:36,360","\"Oh\""]
["02:36,360","02:37,960","\"You're actually bad\""]
["02:37,960","02:44,860","\"He was on the verge of it and then that crab happened to you\""]
["02:44,860","02:55,920","\"Yeah, crab. Here's a chicken. I'm gonna get it. You're a crab battle. That was so good\""]
["02:55,920","03:01,780","\"You're gonna cry people. Yeah, crap people looks like crab talks like people\""]
["03:01,780","03:09,280","\"Yeah, you know how you play sonic you jump every two seconds and you don't die. Wow. It's kind of the trick. That's dr. Egg\""]
["03:09,280","03:11,980","\"That is a mac and he's eggier than ever\""]
["03:12,740","03:15,140","\"He's gonna yoke you look out\""]
["03:15,140","03:26,740","\"Oh the music's cool for him, but the Game Boy Advance had such a bad sound card. Oh, you're gonna die\""]
["03:26,740","03:33,480","\"Or get the ring I got one ring that I love Sonic for like you always have that one ring that sticks with you in a fight\""]
["03:33,480","03:36,380","\"classic\""]
["03:37,900","03:43,320","\"He's coming back. It's coming back for more dude. He literally made this machine just to smash your lead with a hammer\""]
["03:43,320","03:48,220","\"He did something crazy. It's true, but in reality if I was on a bridge\""]
["03:48,220","03:53,740","\"I would just casually walk to the side and this moron wouldn't have nothing to do his face - should be he gets out of that\""]
["03:53,740","03:57,420","\"And he just has a regular hammer and he hits you in the head and you start having a seizure\""]
["03:57,420","04:01,420","\"Gorillas I kind of\""]
["04:01,420","04:07,680","\"I love the Sonic event series. I think Sonic events - is better than one, but you know you can't win them all\""]
["04:07,680","04:13,840","\"Why didn't we play the hat? I thought this was Sonic Advance 2. We gotta go through them sequence by sequence\""]
["04:13,840","04:18,280","\"I think Sonic Advance 1 is awesome music, so it's the one playing. Sonic Advance 3 had the coolest music I thought\""]
["04:18,280","04:23,520","\"It also had like the whole Sonic Heroes team-up thing before that was even something. Wow, really?\""]
["04:23,520","04:28,320","\"It had a really cool dynamic system. Yeah, I remember playing Sonic Advance 3 on road trips. It was so cool.\""]
["04:28,320","04:34,780","\"Remember Sonic on the end gauge? It was Sonic Advance 1, but it was somehow worse. I actually don't. I don't ever play it.\""]
["04:34,780","04:38,260","\"Engage is screen was fucking horizontal. Yeah, it was really bad\""]
["04:38,260","04:42,860","\"Yeah, that's something on the Sonic game. You can't play it as if you're playing on a CR TV\""]
["04:42,860","04:46,980","\"It has to be widescreen. That's the only way to enjoy a sonic game. You go higher every time you do that\""]
["04:46,980","04:52,380","\"That's crazy. Yeah, man. Well me and home. Whoa, they really cared about momentum back in the day\""]
["04:52,380","04:58,140","\"But you're going higher. Let me know this shit. Don't make no damn sense. It's just Sonic's constantly speeding\""]
["04:58,140","05:02,460","\"He's speeding\""]
["05:03,020","05:09,700","\"This is fun. I like the level design on these stages. They don't feel like punishing like half of the fucking new shit\""]
["05:09,700","05:15,300","\"Like I like I kind of like mania, but I mean I did like me kind of like mania. It's\""]
["05:15,300","05:22,300","\"Insulting I liked mania, but I did feel like the the levels went on pretty damn long\""]
["05:22,300","05:26,220","\"Like I remember flying battery get like seven or eight minutes by the end\""]
["05:26,220","05:30,060","\"And you're almost like running cuz when you hit the nine minute mark, it's like, you know, it's like\""]
["05:30,420","05:35,860","\"It's like you're gonna die soon come after you yeah, but in flying battery it was like um\""]
["05:35,860","05:39,620","\"That was really fucking long and that's just like casually playing a sonic game\""]
["05:39,620","05:46,220","\"What's a nice callback dude this fucking music ribs. I know it's awesome\""]
["05:46,220","05:54,340","\"Did Michael Jackson do this one too or no no, I think they had to remove Michael Jackson from Sonic 3 I\""]
["05:54,340","05:59,460","\"Don't I don't think they removed him like they removed him from the credits\""]
["05:59,460","06:04,980","\"They exalted him of all credit. Yeah poor ma'am. He just wanted to love sonic like everyone else\""]
["06:04,980","06:10,540","\"Yeah, he was the biggest sonic fan and that's probably what his downfall was he was an advanced sonic fan\""]
["06:10,540","06:18,140","\"And the more advanced you get the more you look like him. Yeah, the more your skin\""]
["06:18,140","06:23,720","\"Whitens yeah, so you gotta like you got a place sonic and moderation. That's why it's called sonic advance\""]
["06:24,980","06:26,720","\"You're absolutely\""]
["06:26,720","06:30,700","\"Blashed in through this level and I'm loving I feel like I should be going a lot faster\""]
["06:30,700","06:35,000","\"I'm I feel like a failure on a slide honestly can't tell if you're going forwards or backwards right now\""]
["06:35,000","06:41,040","\"I hate those springs that she back. Yeah, they put a lot of those in this. It's like oh you got me for a split second\""]
["06:41,040","06:44,620","\"But I'm just coming back. It's like the same old trap. Thank you. Yeah. Oh\""]
["06:44,620","06:49,300","\"Yeah, you can do the thing where you like when you land you do like a roll. That's so cool\""]
["06:49,300","06:51,300","\"Like when you're at a stop you just go\""]
["06:51,300","06:55,380","\"It's not working. I guess it's not as simple as it sounds. It's not you\""]
["06:55,380","07:00,700","\"It's not looks pissed when he hangs off that so does he have like the homing attack in this or what was that?\""]
["07:00,700","07:02,700","\"What's that thing you keep doing with uh?\""]
["07:02,700","07:09,300","\"That's your a flashy move that you got in like Sonic 3 you she you like hits enemies farther than you hmm\""]
["07:09,300","07:15,380","\"But it was never like utilized or brought into any other game. It's a human race easier. I\""]
["07:17,860","07:22,260","\"Like the shields you got yeah, I hate that they got rid of all the shields\""]
["07:22,260","07:27,640","\"Jesus a long fucking stage. I feel like it's like I know it's been like only two minutes\""]
["07:27,640","07:30,180","\"But it still feels like it's taken forever. Holy shit Jesus\""]
["07:30,180","07:32,900","\"Are we to boss fight? Yeah?\""]
["07:32,900","07:36,580","\"Anyway\""]
["07:36,580","07:41,460","\"Explanation for this one is I gotta be honest like I feel like the hammer was a better like thing\""]
["07:41,460","07:46,020","\"I feel like this one is makes him objectively worse because he flies normal\""]
["07:46,020","07:49,960","\"Like land on how does that count? Oh the wave of the ground?\""]
["07:49,960","07:55,740","\"I think he's cheating. All right. He acts okay. He's actually a fell. He was actually a lot jump\""]
["07:55,740","08:00,920","\"Fuck me, dude. No, I'll still beat him, but he is dastardly\""]
["08:00,920","08:05,840","\"You're a ring. No, it's over boy. It's it. Oh\""]
["08:05,840","08:09,660","\"Fuck that was so fucking scary. Oh\""]
["08:09,660","08:15,540","\"Cory that was amazing. That was scary. I was little way that had a ring already. Okay. Never mind. Oh\""]
["08:15,540","08:17,540","\"I was playing on no ring gas\""]
["08:17,540","08:20,540","\"Three more of the girls. Those girls need to run for it.\""]
["08:20,540","08:21,540","\"Why are there always...\""]
["08:21,540","08:27,040","\"It's like there's only purple gorilla gorillas. I've never heard of a purple gorilla. I love this song.\""]
["08:27,040","08:28,940","\"*sings*\""]
["08:28,940","08:32,140","\"Oh look at that, Sonic Heroes. That's how you do a ping pong thing.\""]
["08:32,140","08:33,440","\"PING PONG THING.\""]
["08:33,440","08:35,440","\"Uh, were you guys having issues? Oh my god. It was so bad.\""]
["08:35,440","08:37,440","\"The casino stage. The casino stage.\""]
["08:37,440","08:44,540","\"So bad. Here's the thing, Sonic Heroes is fun, but the problem with the casino stage is the gravity movement on the paddles and stuff.\""]
["08:44,540","08:49,600","\"Basically you control better when you don't touch anything, but then you can't like control where Sonic goes\""]
["08:49,600","08:51,600","\"So you just set the whim of the game and that's not fun\""]
["08:51,600","08:57,580","\"I always want the game to bend to my will. Yeah, that's why I'm the game master. I\""]
["08:57,580","09:03,260","\"Think I think the casino stage and the fucking mansion stage are like the mansion stages\""]
["09:03,260","09:07,960","\"There's boring because it's like the antithesis of a Sonic game and it's not a game you want multiple paths\""]
["09:07,960","09:09,960","\"You know like multiple places to go\""]
["09:10,360","09:17,700","\"Expansive the fucking mansion level is just like hallways and corridors like you're playing fucking sonic forces go this way\""]
["09:17,700","09:23,100","\"Am I losing time with the hell is a music's going fucking freaking out?\""]
["09:23,100","09:30,000","\"Well, what is happening? Oh, I have the speed shoes. I keep like fucking sideways spray. So doesn't even matter\""]
["09:30,000","09:32,420","\"Yeah, I don't know why to do that. I\""]
["09:32,420","09:37,860","\"Guess they need to think this Chris. It's padding, you know in like any s they made like ultra hard\""]
["09:37,860","09:40,400","\"Well this they just put fucking springs everywhere. That's how they make sonic\""]
["09:40,400","09:46,700","\"Likes harder, but it's not really hard. It's like it's just to annoy child's yeah\""]
["09:46,700","09:48,200","\"There's a noise kids\""]
["09:48,200","09:53,820","\"But I feel like that that's just gonna work the opposite. I love to annoy a child make child stronger\""]
["09:53,820","10:01,020","\"When child's is annoyed they become more powerful go down. They just learn more. It's true. Oh\""]
["10:03,060","10:05,460","\"Oh, why would you put something in my way going up?\""]
["10:05,460","10:06,760","\"Yeah, it ruins it.\""]
["10:06,760","10:08,260","\"It ruins the excitement.\""]
["10:08,260","10:09,160","\"That's what I'm talking about.\""]
["10:09,160","10:10,660","\"This game is shitty level design.\""]
["10:10,660","10:11,660","\"Yeah, I get it.\""]
["10:11,660","10:14,760","\"I like Sonic Advance 2, but it's still good to get this one out of the way.\""]
["10:14,760","10:16,760","\"Take it off the bucket list.\""]
["10:16,760","10:21,660","\"Chris's bucket list is to play every Sonic game and then go skydiving while playing the last one.\""]
["10:21,660","10:23,660","\"Don't say that.\""]
["10:23,660","10:24,660","\"I'm not doing it.\""]
["10:24,660","10:26,860","\"Only when you beat the Sonic game while your parachute opens.\""]
["10:26,860","10:28,860","\"You better get a good speed rating.\""]
["10:28,860","10:29,860","\"I'll never use my leg.\""]
["10:29,860","10:30,860","\"Just skydiving.\""]
["10:30,860","10:31,860","\"Hell no.\""]
["10:31,860","10:35,440","\"That's the last game you play if you can't beat supersonic racing\""]
["10:35,440","10:39,680","\"Super sonic are yeah\""]
["10:39,680","10:45,740","\"Sonic are it's like a five-minute game. We could get that shit done in 30 minutes. That game's dog shit\""]
["10:45,740","10:51,140","\"I owned it. I the best thing of that is the music genuinely. We've been listening to it all week\""]
["10:51,140","10:56,900","\"It's awesome fucking lyrics that are so fucking psychotic. They are crazy, but they're so like catchy\""]
["10:56,900","10:59,800","\"Hit the balloon go the opposite direction\""]
["11:00,820","11:05,780","\"You're so fast you're like a sonic. You're like playing a sonic game\""]
["11:05,780","11:08,820","\"I fucking love sonic janey\""]
["11:08,820","11:12,340","\"Okay, no you call me egg man\""]
["11:12,340","11:17,460","\"I know\""]
["11:17,460","11:24,180","\"It would don't be such a prune. Oh son. You gotta be like me and be obsessed with sonic. You'd be like I like called duty\""]
["11:24,180","11:30,340","\"Nothing said I want to read a book. You're no son of mine. That's boring\""]
["11:30,340","11:35,260","\"You should run a lot you need a cosplay zayby so I can kiss you\""]
["11:35,260","11:54,500","\"Copy\""]
["11:56,500","12:03,040","\"Yeah, there's no coming back for that kids rolling the ground raffle and I'm awful and he's like where are you serious?\""]
["12:03,040","12:07,260","\"This is why you had me really\""]
["12:07,260","12:15,900","\"Why do you think I have sex with an age woman this\""]
["12:15,900","12:18,660","\"Tick\""]
["12:18,660","12:24,040","\"No, it's fun. No, it's not beep a border. It's the worst ones. You just have to guess where he's\""]
["12:24,700","12:27,100","\"Literally the boss the boss is stand on this platform\""]
["12:27,100","12:30,000","\"So you don't get hurt and then guess where he comes from and then get hurt\""]
["12:30,000","12:35,460","\"Seems like it's the bottom left. Oh, no, there it is. I really got two nice ones in there. Oh\""]

["13:07,520","13:09,840","\"Brenna frost. That's what I said\""]
["13:09,840","13:12,080","\"Brenna frost is his evil twin\""]
["13:12,080","13:15,040","\"And he comes in and he'll go freeze you\""]
["13:15,040","13:18,820","\"I thought you said Brenna floss or Brenna fought what is it?\""]

["21:36,120","21:37,320","\"Yeah, these games are short.\""]
["21:37,320","21:40,120","\"Oh, I remember this level. This level sucked.\""]
["21:40,120","21:41,320","\"No, no, it's pretty.\""]
["21:41,320","21:42,320","\"Genuinely sucked.\""]

["21:44,920","21:47,520","\"Give me 12 reasons why you think it sucked.\""]
["21:47,520","21:50,120","\"You had to like get in a mine cart and it's annoying.\""]
["21:50,120","21:52,920","\"Give me 48 bullet pointed reasons.\""]
["21:52,920","21:58,760","\"40 okay, it's best with tails because tails can fly as sonic your quills get in the way when you're running\""]
["21:58,760","22:06,360","\"It's there you can't see because you jump on springs that make you fall to your death while you slide down\""]
["22:06,360","22:09,660","\"You almost always run into springs that bounce you to your death\""]
["22:09,660","22:15,560","\"That's all I got I mean there might be more but I love those guys are from the OG yes\""]
["22:15,560","22:18,660","\"So everything positive Chris says negates one of your point\""]
["22:20,040","22:22,920","\"That's how we were playing game that was fair\""]

["22:58,640","23:02,860","\"Serious question. What's the worst Sonic game you guys have played that you guys have played?\""]
["23:02,860","23:08,000","\"Chris, I think you said secret ring battle and secret ring. Secret ring is really bad. I'll give you that\""]
["23:08,000","23:10,000","\"That's a good answer\""]
["23:10,000","23:14,880","\"Man, I feel like I stopped playing them like when they started getting really bad\""]
["23:14,880","23:16,880","\"I think shadow the hedgehog\""]
["23:16,880","23:23,100","\"Very terrible game I'm where's one I played I really don't like that, but I'll play it for um justified reasons\""]
["23:23,100","23:29,020","\"Whoa look at that. This is what I was talking about by the way this crap the kicks ass is annoying. No kicks ass\""]
["23:29,020","23:34,520","\"See that's fun\""]
["23:34,520","23:41,920","\"Cory no see what this one I'm talking about let's why I don't like this stage because a lot of this crap a lot of fucking boring platform\""]

["23:44,040","23:46,040","\"Yeah, I will say like\""]
["23:46,040","23:51,980","\"Whenever they make sonic do like too much platforming. I don't want to get it's fine when he has a little bit of platforming\""]
["23:51,980","23:53,480","\"Well, you're doing this kind of crap. I\""]
["23:53,480","23:56,680","\"Mean it's also my fault because I'm probably not playing my best\""]
["23:56,680","24:00,900","\"I'm on the low platform. I also don't know how to do the dash move and I don't want to do it\""]
["24:00,900","24:06,520","\"You're getting sanded on it's true. I think I go here though. You fly in the sand. Oh, no\""]
["24:06,520","24:12,200","\"Were you like sand swimming? I was jumping. Yeah, you can jump in the sand. I don't know why either\""]
["24:12,200","24:14,700","\"I feel like that works against all logic. Oh\""]
["24:14,700","24:22,340","\"See that skip it all just skip it all just jumping right aside. Just jump and run\""]
["24:22,340","24:31,000","\"Yeah, I'm crying on rails in this one. I think you can you can but I think I have to jump on the rails again\""]
["24:31,000","24:35,680","\"They make they streamlined everything with it with advanced to you hit springs immediately\""]
["24:35,680","24:38,600","\"I hope Sonic gets his signature soaps in\""]
