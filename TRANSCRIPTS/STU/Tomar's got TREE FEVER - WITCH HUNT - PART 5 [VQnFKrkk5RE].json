["05:20,360","05:21,360","\"It's a big, big, big end.\""]
["05:21,360","05:26,000","\"It's a good concept, but it takes too long to kill for it to be scary, I think.\""]
["05:26,000","05:27,480","\"Because now it's just like tedious a little bit.\""]
["05:27,480","05:29,320","\"You have to go and chase it.\""]
["05:29,320","05:32,640","\"It's not quite the impact of a werewolf or the witch.\""]
["05:32,640","05:33,640","\"I still think it's good.\""]

["05:43,560","05:45,320","\"that's just full of forest.\""]
["05:45,320","05:47,400","\"- Wouldn't it be better if the tree was hunting you though?\""]
["05:47,400","05:48,840","\"Like it was after you turned around\""]
["05:48,840","05:50,080","\"and it stops moving or something?\""]
["05:50,080","05:51,440","\"- That would fucking rock, actually.\""]
