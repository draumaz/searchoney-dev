["02:00,160","02:02,160","\"[laughter]\""]
["02:02,160","02:04,160","\"Okay, who are we going to start with?\""]

["03:12,140","03:17,200","\"It was still yellow because it pissed my pants when I was carrying it around one time\""]
["03:17,200","03:21,420","\"Where'd you keep it in your pants? I got pissed aid yellow\""]
