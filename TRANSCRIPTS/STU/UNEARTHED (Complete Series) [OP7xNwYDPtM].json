["44:24,300","44:27,140","\"So I'm saying they probably just bought this thing\""]
["44:27,140","44:33,180","\"Or they just had enough money to pay one guy to make one decent model for their main character\""]
["44:33,180","44:39,340","\"His beard is insanely high res. When did this come out? I don't know didn't say like 2013 or no\""]
["44:39,340","44:44,420","\"I'm thinking of something else. That sounds about right does that sound okay?\""]
["44:44,420","44:50,100","\"I actually think his face is more detailed than the said new Halo the Halo game with the boots\""]
["44:50,580","44:55,100","\"Yeah, people were like complaining that the brutes face looked really low res\""]
["44:55,100","45:02,180","\"They should have just done that yeah, they should have they should have hired the developers of this game to make halo. I agree I\""]

["49:38,300","49:42,060","\"And then it had a cheat code where you could play a Snoop Dogg\""]
["49:42,060","49:48,680","\"There was a whole game where you play Snoop Dogg. It was called Snoop's big adventure. Yeah, is that really true? No\""]
