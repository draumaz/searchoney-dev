["00:04,640","00:07,160","\"So don't get pissy when that's all you get, okay?\""]
["00:07,160","00:09,800","\"- I was promised multiple matrix.\""]
["00:09,800","00:12,460","\"(laughs)\""]

["00:16,640","00:17,480","\"- Yeah.\""]
["00:17,480","00:18,760","\"- We're gonna see them walking around in here.\""]
["00:18,760","00:20,520","\"- I hope, oh God, I hope.\""]
["00:20,520","00:22,160","\"- The Warnerverse.\""]
["00:22,160","00:23,080","\"Me and Lil have seen this,\""]
["00:23,080","00:25,160","\"but Tomer hasn't seen it, so he's playing.\""]
["00:25,160","00:28,240","\"And we wanna get Tomer's live reaction.\""]
["00:28,240","00:33,780","\"Enter the name ah x enter the Matrix\""]
["00:33,780","00:45,120","\"Here we go here we whoa guess who's coming I can see the code you guys\""]
["00:45,120","00:49,880","\"Tomar this is just a normal picture of a person's face\""]
["00:49,880","00:53,000","\"No, man. I see the code behind it\""]
["00:54,200","01:01,060","\"Is this in game? Yeah, yes hair of the Keanu. It's just video. It's a photograph. No, it's not\""]
["01:01,060","01:08,040","\"That's him that's current Keanu reflecting back who and what we are this is all just video\""]
["01:08,040","01:13,400","\"No, we're like a goddamn idiot. Yeah, food right now. You are a heaving with questions\""]
["01:13,400","01:21,360","\"About why we want to choose this that wait a minute. This is just a fucking video. You don't know that\""]
["01:21,480","01:25,680","\"Where do ideas of who we are and what we want even come from?\""]
["01:25,680","01:32,600","\"I want to be a computer-generated character and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes see this is a video\""]
["01:32,600","01:36,840","\"What is real?\""]
["01:36,840","01:42,960","\"Israel Tomar Tomar he's coming back to you Tomar for instance. I'm not even sure why I'm here I\""]
["01:42,960","01:47,760","\"Remember waking up and thinking that I'm supposed to come here\""]
["01:47,760","01:50,960","\"That it was important for me to ask people\""]
["01:50,960","02:00,120","\"people. Is he no? Is he animated? He's animated. Holy shit. That's real. I'm Keanu Reeves.\""]
["02:00,120","02:04,720","\"In an industry where actors have tried to remain. Perpetual looks so cute right now.\""]
["02:04,720","02:11,040","\"We wondered about digital faces. See that's not real. Oh my God. Hi, I'm Carrie Ann Moss\""]
["02:11,040","02:17,480","\"and I played Trinity in the Matrix films. It's like it's still Keanu Reeves. He's just\""]
["02:17,480","02:18,480","\"I'm okay.\""]
["02:18,480","02:19,480","\"It's a change.\""]

["02:21,240","02:26,040","\"We wondered what would identity mean in a completely digital world.\""]
["02:26,040","02:28,200","\"But is this still pretty rendered as the question?\""]
["02:28,200","02:29,660","\"No, this is real time.\""]
["02:29,660","02:33,000","\"You're saying this is all rendered in engine.\""]
["02:33,000","02:34,800","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:34,800","02:35,800","\"Is it crazy?\""]

["02:41,800","02:43,800","\"Yeah, this is what they're on it.\""]
["02:43,800","02:50,840","\"What they wanted. They said they were fine with your theoretical mumbo jumbo, but I needed some sexy action.\""]
["02:50,840","02:51,840","\"Who said?\""]

["03:16,200","03:18,200","\"I just want to...\""]
["03:18,200","03:21,200","\"I need some proof that this isn't just pre-rendered.\""]
["03:21,200","03:23,200","\"You know about this?\""]
["03:23,200","03:24,200","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:24,200","03:27,200","\"It's all supposed to be a little unreal.\""]

["03:29,200","03:30,200","\"Whoa!\""]
["03:30,200","03:33,200","\"Wait, that's like a game engine.\""]
["03:33,200","03:34,200","\"What the fuck?\""]
["03:34,200","03:38,200","\"Yeah, if I made an engine, this is exactly like the thing I would dream about is\""]
["03:38,200","03:40,200","\"Trinity turning to the camera and saying,\""]
["03:40,200","03:43,360","\"and saying this is made in Lyle engine 5.\""]

["03:55,600","03:56,600","\"Yes you are.\""]
["03:56,600","03:57,600","\"Just playing itself.\""]

["04:14,360","04:20,080","\"Dude, I love to like run my hand over that and just get a little bit of blood out of it. You know, I mean\""]
["04:20,080","04:26,120","\"That is pretty sick. I can't believe I'm controlling this. I\""]
["04:26,120","04:29,600","\"Can't believe this is the future\""]
["04:30,880","04:32,880","\"DUMBAAAAA!\""]
["04:32,880","04:34,880","\"I'm tried!\""]
["04:34,880","04:40,220","\"They've uh, they've got to be making a matrix game if they built all this. Oh, yeah\""]
["04:40,220","04:43,480","\"They'd be really dumb not to be\""]
["04:43,480","04:51,260","\"Either that or they built this for the movie because you know how like the Mandalorian they don't they're not using like a green screen\""]
["04:51,260","04:53,260","\"They're using like a big\""]
["04:53,260","04:58,040","\"ground screen that they're projecting like the unreal engine onto you think like\""]
["04:58,840","05:03,800","\"Movies are gonna start using unreal the render stuff now. I think so. I wouldn't be surprised at all\""]
["05:03,800","05:06,360","\"It does look pretty damn good\""]
["05:06,360","05:10,000","\"The music's awesome too\""]
["05:10,000","05:22,080","\"Can you actually aim or can you only hit the yeah, you can only aim it in auto aims for you\""]
["05:22,080","05:23,720","\"Oh, that kind of sucks\""]
["05:23,720","05:28,120","\"Which is why it's possible. This is all still sort of pre-rendered, but\""]
["05:28,120","05:30,120","\"I\""]
["05:30,120","05:34,840","\"Claimed this on my own and it is looking a lot different like when you're playing it. Okay\""]
["05:34,840","05:39,240","\"That was a thing\""]
["05:39,240","05:47,880","\"Well, who is this character it's a cool character that everybody wanted\""]
["05:47,880","05:50,880","\"in the matrix and that's all I'm gonna say\""]
["05:50,880","05:54,880","\"yeah\""]
["05:54,880","05:56,880","\"photo\""]
["05:56,880","06:00,880","\"told me like for auto\""]
["06:00,880","06:03,880","\"you always say that oh that was a bug there was it\""]
["06:03,880","06:05,880","\"I think so yeah\""]
["06:05,880","06:07,880","\"would you call it a glitch in the matrix\""]
["06:07,880","06:09,880","\"it makes sense here\""]
["06:16,880","06:18,880","\"I am strong female\""]
["06:18,880","06:27,080","\"You got it\""]
["06:27,080","06:36,640","\"Well you better not mark this is it Omar don't fuck up so more oh\""]
["06:36,640","06:44,320","\"My god, that's that whole thing is a pretext. There's no like timing at all\""]
["06:44,320","06:46,320","\"Yeah\""]
["06:46,320","06:49,080","\"You just can't do anything until it hits the mark\""]
["06:49,080","06:51,800","\"You don't know that I\""]
["06:51,800","06:54,520","\"Wonder what would have happened if you didn't fire there?\""]
["06:54,520","06:57,040","\"You would have just maybe we should have tested\""]
["06:57,040","07:03,240","\"Next time I get one of those. Oh is that it? Yeah, it's a kind of is that flipping it? Oh?\""]
["07:03,240","07:10,880","\"You don't know but now comes the real magic, right? Well first. It's got to run the credits really what?\""]
["07:12,120","07:18,480","\"Maybe I don't care who made it. Oh, maybe you should look mass AI crowd and traffic\""]
["07:18,480","07:22,480","\"Yeah, you press press the mask a I visualization. Yeah\""]
["07:22,480","07:25,120","\"It's real\""]
["07:25,120","07:28,280","\"See you can make those cars green and those cars blue\""]
["07:28,280","07:32,040","\"Well, look at well, I don't think the bluer cars\""]
["07:32,040","07:37,960","\"Or blue just the parked cars. So you're talking tonight day. It was night\""]
["07:37,960","07:40,840","\"That looks so fucking cool\""]
["07:42,000","07:44,800","\"I'm just gonna toggle as many times as I can\""]
["07:44,800","07:49,480","\"Warning warning strobe warning\""]
["07:49,480","07:52,600","\"Probably would kill a few people doing that\""]
["07:52,600","07:59,040","\"Okay, I won't do it again, but I am gonna do nanite visualization. I don't know why I said that\""]
["07:59,040","08:07,760","\"Said that so forcefully physics and destruction. You're always railing against nanites Tomar. Just let them into your body\""]
["08:09,200","08:15,080","\"Then that night's to toggle displayed slash rendered pixels. Oh look yeah\""]
["08:15,080","08:18,800","\"It turns on and off the anti-aliasing or that's what it feels like I\""]
["08:18,800","08:25,160","\"Really want to see like buildings getting destroyed in these games. Yeah, like can they do that yet?\""]
["08:25,160","08:26,680","\"I would assume\""]
["08:26,680","08:30,640","\"I was always had pretty good like destruction physics and stuff like that\""]
["08:30,640","08:34,400","\"Imagine if it actually could just break any object down into its like\""]
["08:34,400","08:37,080","\"logical like pieces\""]
["08:37,600","08:43,180","\"Like glass into shards and shards into dust. I mean like that shit can't can be done\""]
["08:43,180","08:46,740","\"Look even GTA 4. I'm walking stuff. You're walking here\""]
["08:46,740","08:51,940","\"I'm walking for real you're walking here like a real New Yorker see but this looks more like it's in a game engine\""]
["08:51,940","08:57,660","\"Yeah, it doesn't look as good. We'll press press a triangle and you can like freak him you could fly around\""]
["08:57,660","09:00,560","\"To more freak him go up to guys. I'm free\""]
["09:00,560","09:03,860","\"Coming look at this guy does he look real?\""]
["09:04,580","09:11,880","\"No, he looks like a character in a game engine honestly. Yeah, I feel I feel they'd like they cheat quite a bit on that first part\""]
["09:11,880","09:20,080","\"You made her awkward. Yeah, you made a really uncomfortable. See she's smiling. She's having a good day and then the camera bumps into her\""]
["09:20,080","09:25,480","\"Invisible force like the cars in the city look really good though\""]
["09:25,480","09:32,800","\"She just she was gonna have none of my nonsense. She walked right around me. But what about you? She's cute. She's like oh boy\""]
["09:32,800","09:39,760","\"Oh gosh, what do I do? She's like dancing around with her. I'm just gonna walk around this thing\""]
["09:39,760","09:47,680","\"Whoa, it got awkward again. She's like looking down. She's like oh boy common dear her coffee\""]
["09:47,680","09:51,560","\"She got the same hair as that woman. She got out done, but yeah that woman had her same hair\""]
["09:51,560","09:57,960","\"Dude, this is not the future like I thought it was get really close to shit. Okay. That looks pretty good\""]
["09:57,960","10:01,520","\"Okay, Tomar you got it still looks like it's an engine\""]
["10:01,520","10:10,240","\"Yeah, it definitely maybe they were going between like pre-rendered at certain points in that like like don't get me wrong\""]
["10:10,240","10:19,840","\"This looks gorgeous. Yeah, but it doesn't look real and that's the stuff at the beginning look real or like very damn close to real\""]
["10:19,840","10:22,840","\"There was a point when I was I was like looking at Keanu's\""]
["10:22,840","10:27,880","\"Jacket and it definitely looked way too good to be like cloth physics and then it showed him later\""]
["10:27,880","10:31,220","\"And then it looked like an in-game t-shirt with no physics on it\""]
["10:31,220","10:35,020","\"So I'm pretty sure some of it wasn't being rendered on the fly.\""]
["10:35,020","10:39,220","\"The fact that you're kind of like questioning where the switch was is...\""]
["10:39,220","10:40,820","\"Yeah, still pretty dang good.\""]
["10:40,820","10:46,220","\"You also got to remember that we're going in knowing that this is supposed to be not real.\""]
["10:46,220","10:47,020","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\""]
["10:47,020","10:48,020","\"Tomer get in the car.\""]
["10:48,020","10:53,220","\"So like especially when you do like a shot from like far away or like high up,\""]
["10:53,220","10:56,820","\"it really does look... Oh my god, I didn't even know you could do that.\""]
["10:56,820","10:57,820","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:57,820","11:00,220","\"It's got Unreal on the license.\""]
["11:00,220","11:02,220","\"Can we do this?\""]
["11:02,220","11:07,380","\"Look at that. That looks pretty dang good. There's no soft body physics. There is\""]
["11:07,380","11:15,740","\"Look at that. That's awesome. All right. The destruction of the car looks pretty sick. Yeah, I wish the destruction to the people was good\""]
["11:15,740","11:26,540","\"It seemed right I think I might have yeah, I think the car is busted. It won't run anymore. That feels real\""]
["11:28,220","11:32,380","\"You killed the guy in that car can we get out like a nice sports car. Yeah, look at those\""]
["11:32,380","11:39,100","\"I wish you could fly around his can who though? Well your current shattered shattered in a code\""]
["11:39,100","11:42,020","\"All right, here we go. Let's get up to speed\""]
["11:42,020","11:49,060","\"Tomar gets out of a cart shatters into code. All right. We got a nice straightaway here. Oh, no turn\""]
["11:54,220","11:59,180","\"Oh, don't do that. Oh that fucker. He hit that car. This is a nice little SUV\""]
["11:59,180","12:05,100","\"I'd love to go on a road trip in that thing. What city is this supposed to be New York?\""]
["12:05,100","12:11,080","\"Yeah, it's it's green-tint city now. I can get up to speed. I always wanted to go to green-tint city\""]
["12:11,080","12:14,860","\"88 miles per- oh\""]
["12:14,860","12:20,220","\"Hold on learn how to drive dude. I wanted to hit 88 miles per hour\""]
["12:20,220","12:32,300","\"I've taken some data. Oh, those things actually work in this game. This one looks like it's\""]
["12:32,300","12:37,340","\"pretty fast. Yeah, that looks like a concept. I bet you can get up to 150 Tomar. I want\""]
["12:37,340","12:44,900","\"to. You just got to avoid the other people. That's all. It's too congested. There you\""]
["12:44,900","12:52,400","\"Yeah, yeah, we got it. Yeah, we just lost one mirror. Who needs it. That's gonna make you more aerodynamic not to\""]
["12:52,400","13:07,260","\"These physics like invincible I barely took any damage from that\""]
["13:07,260","13:11,380","\"I'm glad they put water all over the road to make it look nicer\""]
["13:11,380","13:14,420","\"Yeah, I wish I could just blast off\""]
["13:14,420","13:18,420","\"Oh my god you rolled!\""]
["13:18,420","13:20,420","\"Oh that is sick.\""]
["13:20,420","13:21,420","\"That's cool.\""]
["13:21,420","13:24,420","\"That's kind of fun.\""]
["13:24,420","13:26,420","\"This thing must have a roll cage in it.\""]
["13:26,420","13:28,420","\"Did you do that just by like...\""]
["13:28,420","13:32,420","\"Did you do that just by shear inertia?\""]
["13:32,420","13:34,420","\"I hand-braked.\""]
["13:34,420","13:36,420","\"Also the frame rate is awful.\""]
["13:36,420","13:40,420","\"We are testing the limits of the engine.\""]
["13:40,420","13:43,200","\"- In a few more years, it's gonna be crazy.\""]
["13:43,200","13:45,700","\"(laughs)\""]
["13:45,700","13:47,020","\"- Tomar.\""]
