["31:55,200","32:00,560","\"pick it up and then you right click on it and your inventory got it. See, I wanted to assume\""]
["32:00,560","32:07,420","\"that it's, it's just pubg, uh, vacation. I know, but I don't, I don't play. I was going to say,\""]
["32:07,420","32:10,900","\"they're all really kind of intuitive with that game too. I took me a long time. Yeah, it's kind\""]
["32:10,900","32:15,880","\"hard to learn. Well, at least we got them. We did. We actually doing pretty well. Yeah,\""]
["32:15,880","32:19,900","\"this killed like three guys so far. Which kind of make this job? I like this fucking game.\""]
["32:19,900","32:28,540","\"I hope they optimize it. This is neater. I later this add some goofy movement options.\""]
["32:28,540","32:33,740","\"Let me let me long jump like Mario and ragdoll while doing it. It's just that whoa. Yeah,\""]
["32:33,740","32:37,380","\"you can't do that exactly. You could do something similar to it. If they made this just up on\""]
["32:37,380","32:43,780","\"The right all sandbox. Yeah, it'd be great. All this game really would need is a little bit of a yeah\""]
["32:43,780","32:48,940","\"Yeah, it just needs polish if it gets that this could be way better than PUBG. Yeah\""]
["32:48,940","32:55,700","\"Oops, whoa, that was me. It was supposed to be a joke game too. So you personally shot. Yeah, I accidentally shot\""]
["32:55,700","33:02,120","\"This hand the freaking flip out of it. I didn't mean to scare you like like really cool by the way all these platforms\""]
["33:02,120","33:04,180","\"Yeah, this is yeah\""]
["33:04,180","33:10,700","\"Awesome. Whoops. I like this environment. I also like the way you jump up walls and shit. It feels really good\""]
["33:10,700","33:16,860","\"Yeah, it's because of how they handled it with the physics and everything but it's neat. It's weird\""]
["33:16,860","33:18,860","\"This gave you a thing\""]
["33:18,860","33:21,420","\"You don't think I never thought it'd be the worst part of this game\""]
["33:21,420","33:26,420","\"But I didn't think like the the actual platform where every what I call would be one of the better aspects of it\""]
["33:26,420","33:28,900","\"Yeah, it's fun. It was really satisfied to just jump around\""]
["33:28,900","33:33,460","\"That's why movement stuff would be cool because it means everyone would just be flying around on platforms\""]
["33:34,020","33:40,560","\"It is kind of funny how this game could beat it just for fun\""]
["33:40,560","33:46,300","\"Look these games need to be fun. Ultimately. Yeah\""]
["33:46,300","33:49,180","\"Oh shit\""]

["34:11,600","34:17,680","\"Screen that the screen actually shows where the marker is what we'll make it if we keep going\""]
["34:17,680","34:22,460","\"That was fucking epic\""]
["34:22,460","34:27,760","\"Splinter grenade that's so cool\""]
["34:27,760","34:30,880","\"Hey, you see this you my little laser oh\""]
["34:30,880","34:33,440","\"Like that\""]
["34:33,440","34:37,880","\"Scared me there's no point to the laser in this it just points you out to other players\""]
["34:37,880","34:41,480","\"It doesn't help you at all\""]
["34:41,480","34:48,300","\"Love this part shit. It's doing the thing. Yeah, this is\""]

["34:58,560","35:03,480","\"18 left\""]
["35:03,480","35:10,900","\"I don't multiplayer games want to just be fun why is everyone trying to make more focused environments that are a lot more limited\""]

["35:15,560","35:18,960","\"You're the king I'm the king\""]
["35:18,960","35:20,880","\"This is all the\""]
