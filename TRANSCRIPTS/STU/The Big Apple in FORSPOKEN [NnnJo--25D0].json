["00:05,920","00:08,420","\"You just like were running around the guards a second ago\""]
["00:08,420","00:12,360","\"No, I think she maybe she said something about like poisoning their food or something\""]
["00:12,360","00:15,980","\"Okay, yeah, maybe yeah, no she baked like something into their pie back pills\""]
["00:15,980","00:17,060","\"You need to be able to cookies, yeah\""]
["00:17,060","00:18,780","\"But uh, what's that called?\""]
["00:18,780","00:19,420","\"Lyle when...\""]
["00:19,420","00:19,920","\"Xanax?\""]
["00:19,920","00:23,500","\"No, it's when you're doing something in a game that doesn't make sense in the context of the world\""]
["00:23,500","00:24,980","\"Ludo narrative dissonance\""]
["00:24,980","00:26,680","\"Yeah, that's what that is, Zach\""]
["00:26,680","00:27,180","\"Oh\""]
["00:27,180","00:28,700","\"Ludo narrative dissonance\""]
["00:28,700","00:30,300","\"I've never heard that phrase before.\""]
["00:30,300","00:36,460","\"It's like if I am playing a game as Mario and I run back and forth,\""]
["00:36,460","00:38,300","\"Mario wouldn't run back and forth.\""]
["00:38,300","00:38,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:38,780","00:41,820","\"No, I think the more like real complaint is like-\""]
["00:41,820","00:44,620","\"Like, Metal Gear Solidar and Charli killing people.\""]
["00:44,620","00:46,780","\"Like, that those characters wouldn't do that.\""]
["00:46,780","00:48,300","\"If you kill a guy in a cutscene, it's like,\""]
["00:48,300","00:50,620","\"\"\"Oh my god, I killed a guy, but if you kill a guy in the game,\""]
["00:50,620","00:51,580","\"it's not a big deal.\"\"\""]
["00:51,580","00:53,260","\"Or like, if you get shot in a cutscene-\""]
["00:53,260","00:56,220","\"Oh my god, I'm hurt, but you get shot in the game all the time.\""]
["00:56,220","01:00,220","\"- I really good game is jumping to the character's shoes.\""]
["01:00,220","01:01,740","\"- Yeah, it's better not to do that.\""]
["01:01,740","01:02,820","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:02,820","01:03,980","\"- Most games do do that.\""]
["01:03,980","01:06,180","\"- It's just whatever.\""]
["01:06,180","01:07,100","\"- I think,\""]
["01:07,100","01:08,860","\"- In theory, it's better not to do that,\""]
["01:08,860","01:10,540","\"but it can cut into the game.\""]
["01:10,540","01:11,900","\"- You can also make a game not fun\""]
["01:11,900","01:13,140","\"because you also, in a game,\""]
["01:13,140","01:14,980","\"people are most likely to do the things\""]
["01:14,980","01:16,140","\"you're not supposed to do.\""]
["01:16,140","01:16,980","\"- Yeah, exactly.\""]
["01:16,980","01:18,020","\"- If you find the most fun,\""]
["01:18,020","01:19,340","\"you can kind of just let it happen.\""]
["01:19,340","01:20,780","\"- I mean, that's why it's probably the best thing\""]
["01:20,780","01:23,260","\"to do is bake the fact that your character\""]
["01:23,260","01:24,860","\"can do anything in the story.\""]
["01:24,860","01:25,700","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["01:25,700","01:27,900","\"- Like a GTA makes sense 'cause you're a criminal.\""]
["01:27,900","01:29,220","\"That's why you could shoot people on the street.\""]
["01:29,220","01:31,540","\"- Yeah, I think you played GTA 5.\""]
["01:31,540","01:32,380","\"- Yeah.\""]
["01:32,380","01:35,220","\"- I think Trevor specifically is a good example\""]
["01:35,220","01:36,700","\"of lamp shading that where it's like,\""]
["01:36,700","01:38,340","\"oh, this guy's a fucking psycho.\""]
["01:38,340","01:39,180","\"- Yeah, you can't get him in here.\""]
["01:39,180","01:40,700","\"- So it makes sense. - Yeah, you can't get him in here.\""]
["01:40,700","01:42,500","\"- Wouldn't make sense if you just kill people\""]
["01:42,500","01:43,900","\"with a hammer or point of his hand.\""]
["01:43,900","01:45,140","\"- Man, why did that take?\""]
["01:45,140","01:46,100","\"Did you see that?\""]
["01:46,100","01:47,660","\"- Took a really long time.\""]
["01:47,660","01:48,500","\"- Took it for a really long time, yeah.\""]
["01:48,500","01:51,900","\"Well, 'cause she's explaining the concept of waiting.\""]
["01:51,900","01:52,740","\"'Cause like, what if the guard--\""]
["01:52,740","01:54,140","\"- Yeah, I love doing that playing game.\""]
["01:54,140","01:59,120","\"The guard turns around and that's when you wait for your opening it's really fun to wait for things\""]
["01:59,120","02:01,120","\"I'm pleased with the guards without all of them. Oh\""]
["02:01,120","02:04,920","\"No\""]
["02:04,920","02:06,920","\"Guys coming over. Oh\""]

["02:14,680","02:16,600","\"Oh\""]
["02:16,600","02:20,860","\"There could be someone behind there, but I'm not sure but a doi\""]
["02:21,840","02:23,840","\"Well, I'm stupid. Dory\""]
["02:23,840","02:32,200","\"What's good? Are you doing something? No, I don't know why it's doing it like this is so weird doesn't let you do anything right now\""]
["02:32,200","02:34,440","\"Look at this. He's trying to move I can see it\""]
["02:34,440","02:39,700","\"I could have tell me if I write about this. I feel like 70% of this game has been watching stuff happen\""]
["02:39,700","02:44,960","\"That is cool. We pick story mode. I get it, but also it does these like cutscenes\""]
["02:44,960","02:47,880","\"I don't get it. Why would they not just have big cutscenes and mostly gameplay?\""]
["02:47,880","02:50,280","\"That's what a guess what a good like cutscene thing would be\""]
["02:50,720","02:55,620","\"Okay, so what would be right? No, you're right like I think that was a little bit of that difficulty\""]
["02:55,620","03:00,080","\"I don't know if it's hand-holding us more because you picked that I just I don't know why it's doing\""]
["03:00,080","03:02,080","\"It's showing us the same thing over and over\""]
["03:02,080","03:07,080","\"See I can't imagine this wouldn't have happened if you picked a different mode. Let's say\""]
["03:07,080","03:16,520","\"Maybe that is why it's doing it just baby mode. They really don't trust that you can't just you think that they animated this by hand for an easy\""]
["03:16,760","03:24,040","\"Difficulty I don't think so I have trouble thing in there. I am I would be shocked if this was not in the other modes\""]
["03:24,040","03:28,360","\"Well, we don't know and she's like walking on her own. I'm not doing anything\""]
["03:28,360","03:31,280","\"I'm not able to control her by the way\""]
["03:31,280","03:32,400","\"I love how she's covering her face\""]
["03:32,400","03:38,040","\"But the most I did only about her is a giant golden bracelet. That's that covered up. She should be covering up that fine body of hers\""]
["03:38,040","03:41,240","\"She's a bag of your shirt\""]
["03:41,240","03:43,440","\"She's be where the giant potato sack\""]

["06:06,660","06:13,260","\"Nobody this nobody will enjoy this game. I'm confident in saying that many have tried to find what's outside the city\""]

["06:30,780","06:35,940","\"Think it's more so the motion captures not right. No, I think my theory is correct. Look. They're just always shaking\""]
["06:35,940","06:40,880","\"Might be this like candlelight effect that they're not every cutscene. I\""]
["06:40,880","06:45,820","\"Don't want to help you. I just want to have no direction whatsoever on how to do anything\""]
["06:45,820","06:47,820","\"Can we not talk to this woman anymore?\""]
["06:47,820","06:51,060","\"That'd be great\""]

["07:05,120","07:07,760","\"You might as well\""]
["07:07,760","07:14,000","\"At least people will probably be more interested in checking it out if yeah if you go like you can't make it through this game\""]
["07:14,000","07:19,360","\"Yeah, this game is so hateable the maker just sucks the dialog is annoying the game is trying to play it\""]

["07:39,840","07:45,080","\"The story's riveting what's going on. My favorite part is the many pauses between\""]

["08:26,540","08:33,140","\"I'm going I'm going three cutscenes per cutscene drink drink warm milk. You go to bed. Is there a door?\""]
["08:33,140","08:40,820","\"Yeah, that was really a cutscene within a cutscene those three also you would think you could jump through that window\""]
