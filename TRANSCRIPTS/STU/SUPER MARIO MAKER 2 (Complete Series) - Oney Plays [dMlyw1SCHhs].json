["05:58,300","06:00,780","\"Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about now.\""]
["06:00,780","06:04,220","\"We convinced Jeff to front page this kids drawing.\""]
["06:04,220","06:07,900","\"And everybody gave it one star and said really nice things about it.\""]
["06:07,900","06:09,900","\"It's really stupid.\""]
["06:09,900","06:15,020","\"But that was like literally 10 or like 12 years ago.\""]
["06:15,020","06:18,140","\"This is the second part of a trilogy.\""]

["06:37,640","06:42,540","\"If you have a tattoo of the schematics of a prison that they lock you up and like a guy sees that...\""]
["06:42,540","06:44,460","\"I guess.\""]
["06:44,460","06:45,260","\"It's true.\""]
["06:45,260","06:45,260","\"So why would they-\""]
["06:45,260","06:47,580","\"Why would they throw you in that same prison?\""]

["07:02,040","07:08,660","\"That's good. Give me another one of these okay. Well now you do the same thing there. There you go. Ah\""]
["07:08,660","07:15,700","\"Pattern recognition Wow, I've got the human brain. So wait. What was the fucking P for for pussy?\""]
["07:15,700","07:21,820","\"Nice. Oh shit. This is gonna be a tricksy. Come on shoot that. Yeah\""]
["07:21,820","07:26,820","\"I think you could have used the P to get all those coins on the left. Did you freakin see that? That was awesome\""]
["07:26,820","07:28,820","\"That was sick nasty\""]
["07:28,820","07:29,820","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:29,820","07:34,420","\"This is like a real Yoshi prison. Wow, I hope that Yoshi fucking died.\""]
["07:34,420","07:38,920","\"Wow, I hope that Yoshi makes me a person bitch. Thank you. Oh wow, look at this\""]
["07:38,920","07:45,500","\"This is a crazy puzzle. I don't know what to do. I'm really stum. Do I hold right or nothing?\""]
["07:45,500","07:49,340","\"Go go\""]
["07:51,020","07:54,140","\"That is 50 oh good\""]

["08:18,420","08:23,700","\"Damn fucking long. Yeah, damn long that thing lost its life\""]
["08:23,700","08:29,920","\"Well, I knew you were fucking smart, but I didn't perceive this kind of stuff. I think it's gonna follow the arrow exactly\""]
["08:29,920","08:35,980","\"Yeah, you're what did that say?\""]
["08:35,980","08:42,620","\"You're with a correction bug. This is like weird an esoteric and kind of a guard\""]
