["06:26,880","06:29,880","\"It was that tectonic plates weren't real.\""]
["06:29,880","06:31,320","\"And they were just shy.\""]
["06:31,320","06:34,080","\"- There's a conspiracy that's moving around.\""]
["06:34,080","06:38,200","\"- There's a conspiracy that the Earth does not have\""]
["06:38,200","06:41,080","\"moving tectonic plates, but that the Earth is growing in size.\""]
["06:41,080","06:42,240","\"And that's what's pushing--\""]
["06:42,240","06:43,080","\"- Oh, Zach, get out of here.\""]

["06:45,000","06:46,560","\"Could do anything.\""]
["06:46,560","06:47,400","\"So, the idea I could do.\""]
["06:47,400","06:48,440","\"- Come down here.\""]
["06:48,440","06:50,280","\"So, there's a conspiracy that there's no tectonic plates.\""]
["06:50,280","06:51,120","\"- No, I can correct me.\""]
["06:51,120","06:53,120","\"There's a conspiracy that the tectonic plates\""]
["06:53,120","06:57,700","\"I think it's that the tectonic place of that moved apart, but the earth is growing in size\""]
["06:57,700","07:00,760","\"Like it's just it's growing up. It's hitting puberty\""]
["07:00,760","07:02,760","\"But wait no like literally\""]
["07:02,760","07:07,640","\"Imagine your fill your balloon the earth itself is literally growing which is put but the continents are the same size\""]
["07:07,640","07:14,860","\"Do you see what I'm saying about but imagine you was small one point at all the retouching and that was Pangea\""]
["07:14,860","07:17,080","\"What's in the middle of it that's making it grow?\""]
["07:17,800","07:22,080","\"Justification for these hot takes other than people just wanting to come up with the theory\""]

["07:27,480","07:33,720","\"And you say hey they fit together so it's that same they got the logic is that's used to support the Pangea theory, right?\""]
["07:33,720","07:37,280","\"Well, I the weird thing about this is it's not even\""]
["07:37,280","07:44,600","\"It's not even a rebuke of of tectonic place. I don't think it's just it's instead of saying they move because of\""]
["07:44,600","07:47,280","\"You know the fucking liquid\""]
["07:47,280","07:51,680","\"core or whatever, the mantle pushing plates important together.\""]
["07:51,680","07:54,160","\"Instead of that, I think it's just that it's growing.\""]
["07:54,160","07:55,520","\"- It's a baby.\""]
["07:55,520","07:58,360","\"- But there's gonna have to look up the growing earth.\""]

["08:00,400","08:02,400","\"can you put up a clip of a YouTube video?\""]
["08:02,400","08:04,760","\"- There is a kind of conspiracy of silence\""]
["08:04,760","08:06,120","\"among certain scientists.\""]
["08:06,120","08:08,360","\"They know but are not telling you\""]
["08:08,360","08:10,800","\"that the upper tectonic plates of earth\""]
["08:10,800","08:13,720","\"also join in the Pacific.\""]
["08:13,720","08:16,800","\"Not partially, they join totally.\""]

["08:34,600","08:38,600","\"Yeah, and it's obvious, it's backed up by the Bible, don't you know, Lyle?\""]
["08:38,600","08:44,000","\"Yeah, and then because of that line about Nephilim that everybody won't fucking let go of.\""]
