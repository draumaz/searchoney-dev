["00:10,800","00:12,800","\"I honestly think...\""]
["00:12,800","00:15,800","\"...Shina and Travis are really good at what they do.\""]
["00:15,800","00:20,100","\"Wait, you know that- You know what that mean? I shouldn't try going out the escape, yeah?\""]
["00:20,100","00:22,600","\"No, I think you should, you're just not supposed to do that. Look at the window.\""]
["00:22,600","00:26,800","\"Let's try going back to the- the hell gate source and the spirit seal again once you get the die.\""]
["00:26,800","00:28,800","\"Okay, yeah, that sounds like something I want to do.\""]
["00:28,800","00:34,920","\"She's in there. She's in there. She's there. Wait go back in there in here. Yeah, go back in there\""]
["00:34,920","00:37,960","\"Okay\""]
["00:37,960","00:42,080","\"Wait now she's gone\""]
["00:42,080","00:50,720","\"There's no reason to be in there whatever me dude, whatever, you know the one word that I refuse\""]
["00:50,720","00:57,880","\"You know who I am right the things I've done what I've seen I don't think you've seen me say sub form once\""]
["00:58,280","00:59,460","\"Not even once.\""]
["00:59,460","01:02,840","\"\"\"Prystitul also at the Maker Studio C, the wall that he actually records at?\"\"\""]
["01:02,840","01:03,820","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["01:03,820","01:04,520","\"Who we're in.\""]
["01:04,520","01:07,960","\"Oh, that's the black handles. You have to fulfill the circle, I think.\""]
["01:07,960","01:10,320","\"There's a candle missing.\""]
["01:10,320","01:11,320","\"Yeah, there you go. You have to go.\""]
["01:11,320","01:15,560","\"Yeah, so I gotta go and get the three black handles that I totally could have picked up the first time.\""]
["01:15,560","01:16,480","\"That's exactly right.\""]
["01:16,480","01:17,720","\"You could also play, yes, I guess.\""]
["01:17,720","01:19,120","\"It's the Kira Genesis.\""]
["01:19,120","01:19,620","\"Oh.\""]
["01:19,620","01:21,320","\"I'm a retro materialist in the room.\""]
["01:21,320","01:23,400","\"Oh, so this activates the ritual.\""]
["01:23,400","01:25,880","\"The Kira Genesis is just about fried.\""]
["01:26,880","01:29,760","\"We've summoned far too many spirits for it to handle.\""]
["01:29,760","01:33,280","\"Even returning them might collapse the gate, so I moved three of the ritual candles into the\""]
["01:33,280","01:37,840","\"root cellar. Yeah, I saw them. That should deter any more summoning for now. Spooky will\""]
["01:37,840","01:42,720","\"probably order someone to go get them, but that's not my problem. And odds are they won't survive\""]
["01:42,720","01:47,440","\"down there anyway. Yeah, I bet when we're looking for the candles it's going to be a lot spookier.\""]
["01:47,440","01:51,040","\"It's like waves on that door. Yeah, it's supposed to be like a portal,\""]
["01:51,040","01:54,880","\"but it's weak because they're missing the candles.\""]
["01:54,880","02:01,160","\"Well, we know that they're using a Sega Genesis to see yeah, I love that\""]
["02:01,160","02:05,360","\"That was just power everything on in here. I don't even know why they make you put her down\""]
["02:05,360","02:10,060","\"I think it's just a do I it's probably for the candles so you could just put her there and go pick up candles\""]
["02:10,060","02:13,700","\"It's just so you could have her close to the door. Oh, you're probably right. I assume that's just like it's like an easy\""]
["02:13,700","02:17,280","\"Well, I used to put her sorry. What was it saying?\""]
["02:17,280","02:22,580","\"Really, and Johnson. I gotta say this it really pisses me as cool. Oh god damn spooky\""]
["02:22,580","02:23,580","\"*laughs*\""]
["02:23,580","02:29,580","\"She's never been this rude before.\""]
["02:29,580","02:31,580","\"I think for you here.\""]
["02:31,580","02:33,580","\"Just leave.\""]
["02:33,580","02:34,580","\"Mmm.\""]
["02:34,580","02:35,580","\"You fucking pervert dude.\""]
["02:35,580","02:36,580","\"Whoa, 12 more.\""]
["02:36,580","02:37,580","\"What?\""]
["02:37,580","02:39,580","\"You're looking up her little red slit.\""]
["02:39,580","02:40,580","\"That's not what I did.\""]
["02:40,580","02:41,580","\"Her red slit.\""]
["02:41,580","02:43,580","\"I just wanted to see if it would be locked through.\""]
["02:43,580","02:45,580","\"That's what the guy says at the start of one flow over the cookies nest.\""]
["02:45,580","02:47,080","\"He really calls it a red slit.\""]
["02:47,080","02:48,580","\"He says something gross like that.\""]
["02:48,580","02:51,580","\"He's like, I gotta look up the quote because it's actually disgusting.\""]
["02:51,580","02:52,420","\"Let me see.\""]
["02:52,420","02:54,180","\"- The seal is almost complete and then you see her turn.\""]
["02:54,180","02:55,020","\"- Is that a good movie?\""]
["02:55,020","02:55,940","\"- It's a great movie.\""]
["02:55,940","02:57,700","\"And honestly that moment's pretty funny.\""]
["02:57,700","02:59,420","\"- Doll spirit required.\""]
["02:59,420","03:00,260","\"- You have to put the doll over there.\""]
["03:00,260","03:01,500","\"- Oh, should I bring the dial here?\""]
["03:01,500","03:02,700","\"The dowel?\""]
["03:02,700","03:03,740","\"- The dowel?\""]
["03:03,740","03:04,780","\"- That's what he said.\""]
["03:04,780","03:08,180","\"When you got that red beaver right up there in front of you,\""]
["03:08,180","03:10,660","\"I don't think it's crazy at all, neither do you.\""]
["03:10,660","03:11,500","\"- Red beaver?\""]
["03:11,500","03:12,500","\"- Yeah, it's so cruffish.\""]
["03:12,500","03:14,140","\"- It's fucking nasty.\""]
["03:14,140","03:16,380","\"- So it looks like this might be like a bad ending\""]
["03:16,380","03:19,260","\"and that's why Spooky's telling you to go away.\""]
["03:19,260","03:20,340","\"- This is the bad ending?\""]
["03:20,340","03:22,680","\"- Yeah, probably the heart, probably the good ending\""]
["03:22,680","03:25,260","\"is if we go collect all the candles from the root cellar.\""]
["03:25,260","03:27,680","\"- Oh, she mean you beat it already?\""]
["03:27,680","03:30,780","\"- I don't, I mean, I think if I wanna get a bad ending,\""]
["03:30,780","03:34,500","\"like the tram obviously screwed us.\""]
["03:34,500","03:35,860","\"I say we go to the root cellar.\""]
["03:35,860","03:38,380","\"- Let's go to the root cellar, how long?\""]
["03:38,380","03:41,300","\"- Okay, finally, finally by Raylum Johnson.\""]
["03:41,300","03:44,360","\"I didn't mean to say it irks me that he had the thing\""]
["03:44,360","03:47,220","\"in Maker, what irks me was that they were probably like,\""]
["03:47,220","03:49,380","\"\"\"Come to Maker and record here and it will be way better.\"\"\""]
["03:49,380","03:51,480","\"It's like, why do that?\""]
["03:51,480","03:53,480","\"Why set up a thing away from home\""]
["03:53,480","03:54,720","\"that's so easy to record?\""]
["03:54,720","03:55,940","\"- That's also weird artificial\""]
["03:55,940","03:56,940","\"and kind of defeats the whole\""]
["03:56,940","03:59,240","\"purple charm of the original thing at least.\""]
["03:59,240","04:01,360","\"It's like it's just a guy in his bedroom.\""]
["04:01,360","04:03,000","\"- Come into work and we'll shoot you.\""]
["04:03,000","04:05,520","\"And it's like, you don't really need to do much.\""]
["04:05,520","04:07,080","\"- We'll have 45 people doing the job\""]
["04:07,080","04:08,480","\"that one person could do alone.\""]
["04:08,480","04:09,320","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:09,320","04:11,680","\"I feel like at some point we've all been approached\""]
["04:11,680","04:13,480","\"by people and told to do that.\""]
["04:13,480","04:14,320","\"- Yep.\""]
["04:14,320","04:15,720","\"- Just idiots who don't understand why anything works.\""]
["04:15,720","04:16,560","\"It's like, don't worry.\""]
["04:16,560","04:18,240","\"We'll literally have, again, 45 people\""]
["04:18,240","04:19,740","\"- They'll have a guy bring coffee and a camera guy\""]
["04:19,740","04:20,580","\"and a whole guy, you'll have a guy.\""]
["04:20,580","04:22,060","\"- I think most of the time they're just flat out lying.\""]
["04:22,060","04:25,220","\"They're all like basically glorified salespeople.\""]
["04:25,220","04:26,060","\"They contribute nothing.\""]
["04:26,060","04:27,540","\"- They want money, they want to leech off of you.\""]
["04:27,540","04:29,060","\"- They just want money and they want credit\""]
["04:29,060","04:31,780","\"for leaching your money into the bigger company.\""]
["04:31,780","04:35,060","\"- We'll help you do things that you don't have to do.\""]
["04:35,060","04:36,100","\"- It rocks.\""]
["04:36,100","04:39,900","\"- They'll get a guy to add keywords to your video.\""]
["04:39,900","04:42,420","\"Like cool, funny video.\""]
["04:42,420","04:43,340","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:43,340","04:44,980","\"- SEO, we know all about SEO.\""]
["04:44,980","04:46,620","\"We'll put hashtag funny.\""]
["04:46,620","04:50,360","\"I remember his maker was or not maker some shitty thing I used to be with they were like\""]
["04:50,360","04:58,160","\"Yeah, well do we'll do thumbnails for you. Oh my god. What is that? Oh fuck is that guy?\""]
["04:58,160","05:01,600","\"Get out of here. He's gonna take some take\""]
["05:01,600","05:06,980","\"They were like well David I'm now it's for you. Oh fuck\""]
["05:06,980","05:14,840","\"They did I gave them a test to see what they did and they did it and it was horrible\""]
["05:15,160","05:23,160","\"Just like what why the fuck why would you even offer this why it's because because all those guys are super cocky because they\""]
["05:23,160","05:28,960","\"They're again. It's not about quality. They really do think they they think like oh people are really stupid like yeah\""]
["05:28,960","05:35,400","\"They only click on things because of a stupid face. It's like I mean maybe in some instances. Maybe you're right\""]
["05:35,400","05:42,480","\"But it was a shitty thumbnail. I was gonna say the point is the way they're adding value is all stuff that you could be like\""]
["05:42,480","05:47,920","\"Oh, yeah, just do this I can do that. I don't want to act like they have some like brilliant magical talent\""]
["05:47,920","05:53,120","\"Yeah, it's all it's all the biggest the biggest thing that's annoying about all those look that attitude is\""]
["05:53,120","05:58,260","\"Is always kind of carried with like oh you've been doing it wrong. They're like we can take we can take over that for you\""]
["05:58,260","06:01,360","\"Oh my god, what the fuck?\""]

["06:28,340","06:33,780","\"Shit, oh that makes her come out. I think she comes out anyway\""]
["06:33,780","06:36,700","\"She's certain\""]
["06:37,940","06:43,560","\"This makes it a lot more nerve-wracking to try to do that because she constantly just flies right at you I\""]
["06:43,560","06:49,520","\"Knew you know, I did totally call that this is what it was gonna be like though\""]
["06:49,520","06:52,300","\"Do you know where the other candle is what a little bit said? Oh?\""]
