["19:14,720","19:18,840","\"What is what is the defining characteristic of Hufflepuff again?\""]
["19:19,480","19:24,040","\"I think that one house nobody gives a shit about everyone.\""]
["19:24,040","19:31,480","\"You know, the book always describes it differently, but the general consensus is if you don't belong in any of the other houses, they put you in Hufflepuff.\""]
