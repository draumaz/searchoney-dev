["07:50,300","07:56,660","\"Yeah, no, I'm just habitually collecting shit because my stupid video game at old brain is like this is shiny\""]
["07:56,660","07:59,700","\"I better go for it, but I have no idea what the value of any of it is\""]
["07:59,700","08:05,680","\"I just assume that it has value and that's half the journey Tomar is I'm watching a number tick up\""]
["08:05,680","08:12,560","\"Oh my freaking sec. You might as well just play a clicker game. I\""]
["08:13,780","08:17,520","\"Know I know a few people who play that cookie clicker game that game is\""]
["08:17,520","08:23,540","\"Uh, I recommend that anybody that wants to get acquainted with actually how stupid they are. Let's just play that game\""]

["08:45,660","08:50,740","\"I think the interesting thing about cookie clicker is it doesn't even have the pretense of being good\""]
["08:50,740","08:53,740","\"Like it's just like it's a cookie click it you dumb asshole\""]
["08:53,740","08:59,500","\"And then you do it and then it's like okay you you saw the number moves now you're addicted and it's just like\""]
["08:59,500","09:03,020","\"I thought I thought cookie at least the the cookie clicker. I remember playing\""]

["09:07,340","09:13,260","\"Well, yeah, I mean that's kind of the point though is like I feel like a lot of games try to build themselves on cookie clicker\""]
["09:13,260","09:16,660","\"And people are like I'm having fun with this, but you're not really having fun with it\""]
["09:16,660","09:21,900","\"It's just like cookie clicker, you know, I mean it's scarlet. I don't like her not one bit\""]
