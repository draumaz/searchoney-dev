["09:37,940","09:42,340","\"No, it's explained all the different dissonances to me.\""]
["09:42,340","09:44,260","\"There's cognitive dissonance.\""]
["09:44,260","09:45,260","\"Tell me what that means.\""]
["09:45,260","09:47,020","\"There's a oily dissonance.\""]
["09:47,020","09:48,020","\"What's that?\""]
["09:48,020","09:49,700","\"There's a slippery dissonance.\""]
["09:49,700","09:51,860","\"Tell me what the real ones are, Lyle!\""]
["09:51,860","09:52,860","\"Red dissonance?\""]

["09:58,380","10:00,380","\"What is Lugo Blabber live this morning?\""]
["10:00,380","10:06,580","\"It's some shitty game journalist word that refers to basically what you just did where\""]
["10:06,580","10:11,580","\"The character would never just stand there underneath a fucking thing.\""]
["10:11,580","10:13,260","\"- Well it's annoying to do the video game.\""]
["10:13,260","10:16,500","\"- But the player can do that and it takes you out of the experience.\""]
["10:16,500","10:19,540","\"- Oh so they think it's better if the game doesn't let you do anything fun?\""]
["10:19,540","10:20,380","\"- Yeah.\""]
["10:20,380","10:27,220","\"- Well no, so you legitimately write it would be like if you killed 50 people in the game\""]
["10:27,220","10:31,420","\"and then there was a cut scene where your character kills a person and they get all\""]
["10:31,420","10:32,740","\"\"\"Ooh\"\" about it.\""]
["10:32,740","10:33,740","\"- Oh no that makes sense.\""]
["10:33,740","10:37,020","\"- In this game, there's a moment spoiler.\""]
["10:37,020","10:38,820","\"Actually, it's the moment that leads to this moment.\""]
["10:38,820","10:39,980","\"There's a moment in the story\""]
["10:39,980","10:42,940","\"'cause it flashes back to here where Drake gets shot.\""]
["10:42,940","10:45,740","\"You could get shot like 50 times in the game\""]
["10:45,740","10:48,500","\"and it doesn't matter at all, but he gets shot in a cut scene.\""]
["10:48,500","10:49,340","\"- Like there.\""]
["10:49,340","10:50,740","\"- And there's why he's limping around right now.\""]
["10:50,740","10:52,620","\"- I don't think I even shot the gun there.\""]
["10:52,620","10:57,620","\"- You, I think he just blew up for no reason.\""]
["10:57,620","10:59,820","\"Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I did.\""]
["10:59,820","11:01,060","\"I don't think I did.\""]
["11:01,060","11:03,700","\"That was your one bullet that you used.\""]
["11:03,700","11:06,060","\"So I'm sure locking that.\""]
["11:06,060","11:08,140","\"Yeah, maybe that guy just combusted.\""]
["11:08,140","11:10,140","\"So they basically just to wrap this up.\""]
["11:10,140","11:11,860","\"So they don't want it, like in this game,\""]
["11:11,860","11:14,780","\"they would have it so your character's not being shot,\""]
["11:14,780","11:16,420","\"is that a big part of the game or?\""]
["11:16,420","11:20,060","\"Or being shot in a cut scene is not why he's hurt, I guess.\""]
["11:20,060","11:22,900","\"I mean, attention to detail like that is maybe--\""]
["11:22,900","11:24,100","\"Just watch a movie then.\""]
["11:24,100","11:24,940","\"I don't know what you want.\""]
["11:24,940","11:25,860","\"Watch a fucking movie.\""]
["11:25,860","11:27,500","\"The point of a game is that it's interactive.\""]
["11:27,500","11:28,780","\"It's a--\""]
["11:28,780","11:29,620","\"I don't know.\""]
["11:29,620","11:34,380","\"I guess it I guess it's a valid criticism in some cases, but with something like this where the whole point of the game is\""]
["11:34,380","11:37,480","\"Well, this game kind of is like a movie. Yeah\""]
["11:37,480","11:42,960","\"Quite a movie though. I mean you're still moving or you're still controlling the character\""]
["11:42,960","11:47,500","\"I love walking slow\""]
["11:47,500","11:53,100","\"Yay, that's what he's truly this generation's Mario\""]

["12:16,520","12:19,960","\"I don't have any carries the head the whole game\""]
["12:19,960","12:26,620","\"This is my mission. I have to bring this right back to the start of the he has to escort the head\""]
["12:26,860","12:31,480","\"Through all this like flashback sequence back to the current time and put the head back on\""]
["12:31,480","12:35,940","\"Gribs by the ways\""]
["12:35,940","12:39,420","\"You might want to tear into that gas\""]
["12:39,420","12:46,660","\"So's like a band\""]
["12:46,660","12:51,460","\"Anyway, I don't care, but I don't really care for the record. I don't I dare you\""]
["12:51,460","12:56,440","\"I don't like this voice actresses was in like a lot of stuff around this time\""]

["12:58,920","12:59,920","\"Look at her arms.\""]
