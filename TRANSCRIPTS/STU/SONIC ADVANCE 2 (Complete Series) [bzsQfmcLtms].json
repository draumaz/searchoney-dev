["47:49,340","47:55,380","\"Yeah, no, we don't plan an old like fucking CRT TV where none of us can see I do have a AC\""]

["49:47,980","49:53,800","\"We might not beat every one of them, but the advanced games you probably could well, where's your draw?\""]
["49:53,800","49:58,740","\"I'm confident with advanced games. I'm not so confident with certain 3d ones\""]
["49:58,740","50:03,340","\"That's not foreshadowing or anything. It's just foreshadowing\""]

["50:15,000","50:19,200","\"Do you think people would be hyped if they announced shadow the hedgehog - yes\""]
["50:19,600","50:25,440","\"Yeah, absolutely like there would be a weird contingent of people that insist that that one didn't get a fair shake\""]
["50:25,440","50:28,080","\"Yeah, they'd be like that came just didn't get its fair shot\""]
["50:28,080","50:34,400","\"Yeah, you know, it's so fun to fight to kill enemies and I have to teleport to previous checkpoints to find more enemies\""]

["50:58,840","51:05,200","\"Sega would get in trouble if they put it an orated shadow game. I mean, I don't I don't think so\""]
["51:05,200","51:09,120","\"I don't think so that'll be cool if you can play shadow and just like curb stomp people\""]
["51:09,120","51:14,200","\"Just like a GTA mod like but it's like American history X, but your shadow\""]
["51:14,200","51:16,840","\"I mean that would be cool, but I don't think that you do that\""]
["51:16,840","51:21,360","\"I don't like say I don't want to write their name on that. What did you dodge into it?\""]
["51:21,360","51:26,840","\"I don't know how do you know how you know? I don't know how to do the launch thingy. Oh, okay\""]
["51:26,840","51:30,520","\"That one's confusing. I think they could do like Deadpool with shadow\""]
["51:30,520","51:36,240","\"They could give shadow a sword and a gun breaking the fourth wall all the time\""]
["51:36,240","51:42,440","\"Huh? I just don't care to say anything to the person on the other side. I don't need to impress you\""]
["51:42,440","51:45,240","\"What if Sonic the Hedgehog was yellow\""]
["51:45,840","51:52,840","\"He is bad idea no, no, I mean when he's not amoralized and then he turns blue when he gets the emerald\""]
["51:52,840","51:55,760","\"Yeah, that would be more than I think so\""]
["51:55,760","51:59,780","\"What if something the hedgehog was red what is on the hedgehog was\""]
["51:59,780","52:03,160","\"Turquoise, we're supersonic - how come he has a\""]
["52:03,160","52:08,680","\"Brown oh he's that'd be cool. That's a good idea. Yeah\""]
["52:08,680","52:12,660","\"Doom in on brown sonic from the fucking fleet lake comments\""]
["52:12,660","52:16,440","\"Yes, I read your comments comments. We did that again like we did in the past but now\""]
["52:16,440","52:26,120","\"Blue screen out every shade of blue separately and make it the shard darker shades of brown\""]
["52:26,120","52:28,520","\"Yes for the rest of the video\""]

["52:34,200","52:39,880","\"Fucking no I'd fall to my dad look is the brown techno zone\""]
["52:41,720","52:47,520","\"Look, I love this little like normal head shug just cuz it's brown doesn't mean you can't call it the same thing Chris\""]
["52:47,520","52:53,080","\"What do you mean? It just it's just the techno zone all right the brown type of the brown zone\""]
["52:53,080","52:56,200","\"I feel like the brown zone has poo connotations\""]
["52:56,200","53:01,600","\"Brown sound doesn't always have poo connotation. I feel like this the music roach to being called the brown\""]
["53:01,600","53:07,000","\"There's a there's like a famous like guitar amp tone called the brown sound\""]
["53:09,200","53:15,980","\"Come on, man. I can't fucking react fast enough. They're asking so much like I'm gonna launch you across and you land and you can't fall off\""]
["53:15,980","53:21,640","\"I'm gonna give you exactly fucking one inch of movement space. Well now now you got it. I just believe\""]
["53:21,640","53:26,420","\"Yeah, okay. Well I am on the first fucking stage. Yeah, but I believe\""]
["53:26,420","53:32,080","\"I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Corey the headshot\""]

["53:36,980","53:41,840","\"I guess I'm gonna go on a different path now. Oh\""]
["53:41,840","53:47,500","\"Sonic just went totally stiff and flipped over that skill. Yeah\""]
["53:47,500","53:53,620","\"I'm glad I wasn't the only person that was that disappeared the fuck is even happening. I hate this background\""]
["53:53,620","53:59,260","\"Even before the editor made it brown. I hated this background. Oh\""]
["53:59,260","54:04,540","\"I just want to clarify that that I don't hate it because it's brown. Oh, well, you don't have to be such a coward\""]
["54:04,540","54:07,980","\"Epilepsy warning fine. I hate it a little more now that it's brown\""]
["54:07,980","54:11,500","\"He's too brown for the naked eye\""]
["54:11,500","54:17,040","\"Do you think that Sonic has like a regular butthole or do you think he has like the little like a cat?\""]
["54:17,040","54:21,480","\"We said he has a little penny size butthole that we didn't talk about his penny size butthole\""]
["54:21,480","54:24,860","\"But we were debating more the size of that and if it's bigger small\""]
["54:24,860","54:29,080","\"Michael doesn't have he doesn't need one. He doesn't always need\""]
["54:29,080","54:34,180","\"What you're saying he's like Kim Jong Un where he doesn't poop basically because when he fuse with the chaos emeralds\""]
["54:34,180","54:36,700","\"He doesn't need that need for food anymore\""]
["54:36,700","54:39,860","\"So the perfect chaos am Iling crashed into a bystanding stick or two?\""]
["54:39,860","54:44,580","\"Where does it go when he eats the chili? He burns it so fast. That's why he can move so fast\""]
["54:44,580","54:50,520","\"Yes, he doesn't need a shit anymore. Yeah, his light speed metabolism. I don't like how much fucking sense that man\""]
["54:50,520","54:55,240","\"That's why he doesn't have a butthole, but in the movie you can clearly see tales of knuckles\""]
["54:55,240","55:00,160","\"Yeah, it's like in the movie when knuckles goes do you think I want your butthole?\""]
["55:00,160","55:06,720","\"I don't even I don't know why in that same exact scene\""]
["55:06,720","55:13,000","\"They like changed when he said that because he never said that they literally like faked him a line to make the trailer more awesome\""]
["55:13,000","55:17,960","\"Which you know credit where credits do it was epic, but you know it was be honest with your\""]
["55:17,960","55:22,680","\"Compardre's yeah, they totally rode out the butthole side plot not that\""]
["55:23,960","55:29,760","\"You know, it's crazy. We watched the Mario trailer as of today's recording. We're gonna date the video as Santa's\""]
["55:29,760","55:33,380","\"The Mario trailer came out today in this video, but uh, no\""]
["55:33,380","55:38,260","\"Crazy how much the whole movie being CG makes it so much more likable\""]
["55:38,260","55:43,680","\"I think the sonic movie really fucked itself by being alive. I know what he wanted it to be live action\""]
["55:43,680","55:45,840","\"I mean they said they still think\""]
["55:45,840","55:50,740","\"They managed to like succeed in some regard. I like all the sonic parts\""]
["55:50,740","55:56,340","\"I honestly think the reason Chris you know why you like it and this is what I stand by I wasn't able to say this before\""]
["55:56,340","56:00,940","\"But I do believe that there were two opposing forces to the sonic movie. This isn't a crock pot theory\""]
["56:00,940","56:03,700","\"I believe this to be true. Yeah, Tim Miller\""]
["56:03,700","56:10,440","\"Sucks fucking rear at writing. He's horrible. This is he done. He's done the fucking\""]
["56:10,440","56:13,580","\"Fast and furious you all the family crap\""]
["56:13,580","56:18,360","\"So think of all the parts in the sonic movie where he's like I love my mom and dad and then the fucking\""]
["56:18,700","56:24,220","\"Bianca wedding all that crap remember that shit. Yeah, that was Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler\""]
["56:24,220","56:28,780","\"Probably did all the sonic stuff if we're being honest. I don't think Tim Miller\""]
["56:28,780","56:32,760","\"No, Sonic as much as he knows how fucking families work. I guess\""]
["56:32,760","56:36,460","\"Fucking ass\""]
["56:36,460","56:44,380","\"You know what he made a movie about family and going fast. I think that that's not the worst\""]
["56:45,620","56:49,020","\"Think of it, but I see one paper why they went with it\""]
["56:49,020","56:53,440","\"But do you see do you understand why their human parts were probably written by Tim Miller and\""]
["56:53,440","56:58,060","\"Fowler who directed scenes in Shadow the Hedgehog if you don't believe me you can look it up\""]
["56:58,060","57:02,540","\"He did direct stuff in the shadow the hedgehog. Yeah, the hook has openings. Yeah, he did that\""]
["57:02,540","57:08,500","\"Yeah, I am 100% convinced that the only reason I even liked the Sonic movies is because of Jeff Fowler\""]
["57:08,500","57:14,180","\"Yeah, all this fucking cool sonic scenes were Jeff Fowler and all the dub shit was Tim Miller\""]
["57:14,540","57:16,800","\"Trying to fucking insell himself to the public\""]
["57:16,800","57:23,040","\"Don't worry. He publicly did and then he fucking like went back on it. What I thought I'm gonna die there\""]
["57:23,040","57:28,280","\"No, that's what I was supposed to do. What about that? I'm gonna die there. I mean, I don't think these levels are late ever\""]
["57:28,280","57:32,800","\"I think the instant kill death pits just suck dick. No that you never put in this is just like a\""]
["57:32,800","57:38,040","\"General consensus like it makes sense in a game like crash banekie where you can see that they're gonna kill you\""]
["57:38,040","57:39,360","\"Yeah, it makes no sense in Sonic\""]
["57:39,360","57:42,960","\"Sonic actually genuinely doesn't have a lot of like instant kill death pits\""]
["57:42,960","57:47,440","\"There's a few stages like flying battery zone and like that one stage in Sonic 2 where you're\""]
["57:47,440","57:53,520","\"It's like, you know fucking we were flying on a plane and they do usually just drop you on the spikes or something, huh?\""]
["57:53,520","57:55,520","\"Oh, what the fuck does that?\""]
["57:55,520","57:59,640","\"Again by accident why'd you turn around though?\""]
["57:59,640","58:02,800","\"Because I'm like you okay when I play platforming games\""]
["58:02,800","58:04,040","\"I try to like\""]
["58:04,040","58:08,240","\"Preemptively plan where I'm gonna land and by doing that I move back and forth on the controller\""]
["58:08,240","58:13,520","\"But for some reason they decided to make pressing back and forth and jump do that move\""]
["58:13,520","58:16,760","\"Yeah, and I don't know why that was a horrible decision\""]
["58:16,760","58:22,840","\"Like and that that's supposed to knock you up there, but it never works. It's yeah, it's awful\""]
["58:22,840","58:27,800","\"Yeah, anyways, I still think this game is better than fucking advanced one. I still think it is\""]
["58:27,800","58:32,280","\"I don't care. I know it's annoying, but I would rather if we weren't on like, you know, like\""]
["58:32,280","58:34,960","\"We weren't trying to waste their fucking time\""]
["58:34,960","58:41,080","\"I would probably still be fine doing the stage over again, but I don't want to do the stage over again. Don't worry. We'll be okay now. Yeah\""]
["58:41,080","58:47,960","\"Yeah, he did it again. He went stiff and he flipped\""]
["58:47,960","58:50,960","\"You don't like that, huh? No, I like it\""]
["58:50,960","58:59,520","\"I do think Sonic more often should go stiff or ragdoll like a skate three character. It is funny\""]
["58:59,520","59:02,680","\"Whoa, I didn't touch anything. So afraid something would happen\""]
["59:03,720","59:08,240","\"Cory you're doing great, and I think me and Lyle respect you so much because of this game\""]
["59:08,240","59:13,680","\"Yeah, because of this game guys you guys like you know I really want to see how you place on a good dance before I\""]
["59:13,680","59:22,000","\"This is before we decide if someone's allowed in the club. We make them play sonic advanced - I'm fine with that\""]

["59:33,600","59:36,240","\"Yeah, it was very nice that they put a fucking ground there\""]
["59:36,240","59:43,640","\"Oh my god, don't worry putting those platforms that move fast. Why would I ever want that ever?\""]
["59:43,640","59:48,320","\"Don't do that\""]
