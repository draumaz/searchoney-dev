["29:55,220","29:58,620","\"I love all the Bomberman 64 character designs.\""]
["29:58,620","29:59,540","\"- Bomberman.\""]
["29:59,540","30:02,020","\"- This was, we have like a hacking mechanic\""]
["30:02,020","30:03,900","\"because you're actually playing as like a white hat hacker\""]
["30:03,900","30:05,500","\"and they're black hat hackers.\""]
["30:05,500","30:06,500","\"- Black hackers?\""]

["30:15,740","30:16,580","\"- Let me up here, please.\""]
["30:16,580","30:18,740","\"- It's common cyber security, terminology.\""]
["30:18,740","30:19,740","\"- Yes, that's true.\""]
["30:19,740","30:20,820","\"- I think they should change that.\""]
["30:20,820","30:22,300","\"- Actually, no, you don't, can you explain that\""]
["30:22,300","30:25,740","\"for people because I always found that that was why I included it as a concept because\""]
["30:25,740","30:27,220","\"I always thought that was really fascinating.\""]
["30:27,220","30:30,140","\"I mean, it's as simple as that.\""]
["30:30,140","30:35,100","\"Like people were sick of the negative connotations of the term hacker.\""]
["30:35,100","30:39,500","\"So they invented the idea of like a white hat hacker is someone who only uses hacking\""]
["30:39,500","30:40,820","\"use hacking ethically.\""]
["30:40,820","30:46,660","\"And if they break into someone's system, they don't do it to actually like cause any damage.\""]
["30:46,660","30:50,580","\"They go and they would inform the person of the security flaw and maybe even advise them\""]
["30:50,580","30:51,580","\"on how to fix it.\""]
["30:51,580","30:54,300","\"like brought on to like test like how secure something is.\""]
["30:54,300","30:55,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["30:55,300","30:56,300","\"So basically using their powers for good more or less.\""]
["30:56,300","31:00,860","\"And then you've got your gray hats, which people don't talk about, which are usually\""]
["31:00,860","31:07,140","\"people that like they're not destructive, but they they're like the k, they're like\""]
["31:07,140","31:08,140","\"the chaotic neutral.\""]
["31:08,140","31:10,940","\"They don't really do much.\""]

["31:19,620","31:20,620","\"and destruction.\""]
["31:20,620","31:26,420","\"Yeah. So all the, this is a little design thing we have was that here. So, so you can,\""]
["31:26,420","31:30,020","\"the player character secretly is a hacker. The other like good guy characters don't know.\""]
["31:30,020","31:34,020","\"And then there's Red Hat Linux. And I've got, and I have no idea what a Red Hat is. It's\""]

["31:46,700","31:48,700","\"Hold it like that\""]
["31:48,700","31:52,980","\"National television right now you're a break\""]
