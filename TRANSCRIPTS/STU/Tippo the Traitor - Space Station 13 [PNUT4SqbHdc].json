["00:01,600","00:03,400","\"ONI PLACE!\""]
["00:03,400","00:04,400","\"*SIGH*\""]
["00:04,400","00:12,160","\"My name is Tipo Felangas.\""]
["00:12,160","00:17,200","\"I am an undercover assassin posing as a chemist on board space station 13.\""]
["00:17,200","00:18,960","\"My objectives are simple.\""]
["00:18,960","00:20,280","\"Number 1.\""]
["00:20,280","00:23,200","\"Assassinate the geneticist known as Neo-Kamshah.\""]
["00:23,200","00:24,640","\"And number 2.\""]
["00:24,640","00:28,800","\"Escape the station on the emergency shuttle, and not in custody.\""]
["00:28,800","00:31,800","\"Welcome to the station crew. Enjoy your stay.\""]
["00:31,800","00:35,800","\"I of course worked my job as a chemist for a while to avoid suspicion.\""]
["00:35,800","00:41,800","\"When my partner was comfortable with me, I decided to take a well-earned lunch break, or so he thought.\""]
["00:41,800","00:46,800","\"Like a slippery sneaky snake crawling through the grass, I made my way to the genetics lab on scene.\""]
["00:46,800","00:50,800","\"I peeped in the window with my curious glossy eyes, there he was.\""]
["00:50,800","00:53,800","\"My target, oblivious to my cunning peer.\""]
["00:53,800","00:58,920","\"I left them at bay, and made my way to a room filled with tools I saw when I first entered the station.\""]
["00:58,920","01:03,960","\"I gathered the tools I thought would come in handy, and I was on my merry way to the dorms.\""]
["01:03,960","01:10,840","\"People rarely pass through here, so a perfect secluded area to obtain my assassin gear without the risk of being seen.\""]
["01:10,840","01:17,000","\"I entered my assigned secret code into my PDA ringtone, 862 delta.\""]
["01:17,000","01:17,880","\"Bam!\""]
["01:18,440","01:22,160","\"The syndicate maybe terrorists, but holy gosh darn do they have style.\""]
["01:22,160","01:30,140","\"I now had access to a plethora of assassin gadgets and weapons, but the syndicate allowed me just a few points to spend, so I would have to choose carefully.\""]
["01:30,140","01:35,940","\"I settled on a dual-bladed energy sword, so I could murder in style, like my favorite Star Wars villain.\""]
["01:35,940","01:39,500","\"I also got a sleepy pen, though it is a last resort.\""]
["01:39,500","01:42,500","\"The effects of its slumber take a tad too long for my taste.\""]
["01:42,500","01:44,980","\"I exited the dorms with blood on my mind.\""]
["01:44,980","01:48,020","\"\"\"Neo, calm see it, your seconds are numbered, you fucking cunt!\"\"\""]
["01:48,020","01:52,660","\"I entered Medbay once again. Only this time my heart was pounding out of my chest,\""]
["01:52,660","01:54,740","\"sweat streamed down my fat fucking brow.\""]
["01:54,740","01:57,620","\"I ran down to look in that window again,\""]
["01:57,620","01:59,140","\"Neo was still working inside.\""]
["01:59,140","02:01,780","\"Look at his smug fucking shit eating face.\""]
["02:01,780","02:03,060","\"Son of a bitch.\""]
["02:03,060","02:05,300","\"I ran into a nearby room.\""]
["02:05,300","02:08,260","\"There was a big puddle of blood outside it but I don't know why,\""]
["02:08,260","02:09,220","\"never mind that.\""]
["02:09,220","02:11,700","\"This is where I practiced to hack open a door.\""]
["02:11,700","02:18,420","\"I would have to quickly and successfully hack the genetics lab's door to get a Neo and I would have to get into him before he could get out.\""]
["02:18,420","02:21,700","\"If he escapes to tell security, it's all over.\""]
["02:21,700","02:24,180","\"Hacking a door is relatively simple.\""]
["02:24,180","02:28,740","\"All one must do is turn off the test light, then pry the door open with a crowbar.\""]
["02:28,740","02:33,540","\"However, without insulated gloves, one also runs the risk of electrocution.\""]
["02:33,540","02:40,660","\"Luckily for Tipo Fellangus, I hacked this door unscathed, it is time to kill the rosy-headed baby lipped fuck known as Neo Comcia.\""]
["02:41,060","02:46,100","\"I went to the maintenance door, above his smelly lab, I hacked into it and let myself inside.\""]
["02:46,100","02:49,460","\"The darkness engulfed me, a perfect assassin I am.\""]
["02:49,460","02:54,900","\"I just need to hack one more door in him and, neo-comcha, I hope you had a fight with your wife today,\""]
["02:54,900","02:58,260","\"so when you die she is really upset and can never forgive herself.\""]
["02:58,260","03:02,100","\"Nevermind that is really mean. I still want to kill you though.\""]
["03:02,100","03:03,700","\"I have come this far.\""]
["03:03,700","03:09,620","\"Oh God, I left the door open. Please don't let anyone walk by. Oh fuck.\""]
["03:09,620","03:15,700","\"Shit. Did they see? Fuck. I'll close the panel on the door. I bet they didn't see. If they did,\""]
["03:15,700","03:23,780","\"they didn't even care. Everything is okay. I am good assassin. Shit. Who the fuck? I'm out. Jesus\""]
["03:23,780","03:31,060","\"Christ. I was caught red-handed. Sugar in my mouth, cookies on the floor. By now security must have\""]
["03:31,060","03:36,580","\"been notified while I will not go down without a fight. I made my way back to Medbay trying to\""]
["03:36,580","03:41,620","\"seem as natural as possible. Though I must admit, my lab coat was stuck to my back with\""]
["03:41,620","03:45,780","\"all the sweat. I stood there on that med bay floor, racking my brain for whatever it was\""]
["03:45,780","03:50,540","\"I should do next. This is when I noticed the person standing a few yards behind me. That's\""]
["03:50,540","03:54,420","\"the person that found me in the maintenance tunnel. That goddamn bitch knows what I'm\""]
["03:54,420","03:59,020","\"up to. She started frantically pounding on the door for chemistry, trying to warn them\""]
["03:59,020","04:03,900","\"of what was coming. Suddenly, she ran at me, desperately trying to disarm me. She chased\""]
["04:03,900","04:09,300","\"me down the hallway, clawing at my hands, this wizard. Now or never, I lunged it her with\""]
["04:09,300","04:13,900","\"the strength of a thousand retards. I sliced that fucker to shreds right there in the open,\""]
["04:13,900","04:19,020","\"faster than you can say an old slimy whore, on the cold shiny floor. An audience gathered,\""]
["04:19,020","04:23,920","\"but Tipo Falangus leaves no witnesses. Each human life was cut shorter than the last,\""]
["04:23,920","04:28,900","\"limbs flew in every direction. What had I become, the syndicate had given me one life,\""]
["04:28,900","04:32,760","\"take and now half of Medbay was gone.\""]
["04:32,760","04:37,160","\"Once again, I began hacking into the maintenance tunnel above genetics, but I was greeted by\""]
["04:37,160","04:42,240","\"none other than Neo Kamsha himself, they, he called to me through his window.\""]
["04:42,240","04:46,360","\"Unable to think I responded to him with a much less confident lay.\""]
["04:46,360","04:48,440","\"He must have picked up on my act.\""]
["04:48,440","04:50,560","\"He asked me what I wanted.\""]
["04:50,560","04:53,760","\"Unable to think, I proceeded breaking into the tunnel.\""]
["04:53,760","04:58,080","\"The very moment I pried the final door open, Neo ran into the next room quickly closing\""]
["04:58,080","05:00,220","\"the door behind him.\""]
["05:00,220","05:01,220","\"Piece of shit.\""]
["05:01,220","05:05,460","\"I ran back into the tunnel and made a detour to the main hall, perhaps he was planning\""]
["05:05,460","05:08,800","\"on escaping through science and running to security.\""]
["05:08,800","05:10,200","\"They usually do.\""]
["05:10,200","05:12,500","\"If he does/o cut him off.\""]
["05:12,500","05:16,660","\"Literally ha ha.\""]
["05:16,660","05:20,580","\"I waited at the science department exit for a bit, but he was clever enough to not come\""]
["05:20,580","05:21,580","\"out.\""]
["05:21,580","05:23,660","\"I decided that I was done for.\""]
["05:23,660","05:25,800","\"I made my way back to the met bay.\""]
["05:25,800","05:28,420","\"I don't know why, I had a good feeling.\""]
["05:28,420","05:32,880","\"So much history here, still crumpled in pieces on the ground was the woman, who decided to\""]
["05:32,880","05:34,480","\"fuck with the wrong man.\""]
["05:34,480","05:35,480","\"Fuck.\""]
["05:35,480","05:40,920","\"Another witness, my old chemistry partner, this has to be done, old friend.\""]
["05:40,920","05:52,840","\"Oh my.\""]
["05:52,840","05:57,360","\"My veins were pumping with adrenaline, I sprinted through the station in victory, the man known\""]
["05:57,360","06:02,400","\"as Neo Kamsha's death, I could then contain this feeling of ultimate euphoria, I had to\""]
["06:02,400","06:07,320","\"express myself somehow.\""]
["06:07,320","06:11,080","\"It was at this moment I realized that I was addicted to killing.\""]
["06:11,080","06:12,600","\"What had I become?\""]
["06:12,600","06:15,960","\"Whatever it was, there was no turning back now.\""]
["06:15,960","06:20,960","\"I finally finished hacking that poor innocent bystander and a regello ribbons, I left him\""]
["06:20,960","06:26,400","\"They're on the cold dirty floor, his face forever frozen in that haunting silent screen.\""]
["06:26,400","06:28,280","\"Can you guess where I went next?\""]
["06:28,280","06:33,520","\"Medbay, I have never felt so conflicted in my life, this undeniable happiness was at\""]
["06:33,520","06:37,520","\"war with the deepest sick feeling of guilt I could never have imagined.\""]
["06:37,520","06:42,080","\"I wanted them to catch me, but I also wanted the hunt to go on.\""]
["06:42,080","06:43,640","\"It was me or them.\""]
["06:43,640","06:48,800","\"So far, standing in this hallway got me results, people always pass through here.\""]
["06:48,800","06:53,760","\"\"\"Ah, there you are, we only need one chemist on this station my friend,\"\" he ran out of\""]
["06:53,760","06:56,240","\"Met Bay, and I gave chase.\""]
["06:56,240","06:59,960","\"For a heavy fellow, my partner was surprisingly nimble.\""]
["06:59,960","07:02,320","\"Not nimble enough though I'm afraid.\""]
["07:02,320","07:07,000","\"I clipped him and chased him down Met Bay, where I finished him off in front of the head\""]
["07:07,000","07:10,520","\"of security and my old friend Neo Kamsha.\""]
["07:10,520","07:11,520","\"Wow!\""]
["07:11,520","07:16,760","\"It's like a perfect cake with a cherry on top, the head of security locked the door,\""]
["07:16,760","07:21,480","\"that won't be enough to keep Tipo fell and Gus out of there. Mark my words.\""]
["07:21,480","07:26,440","\"While he hid in his hole like a cowardly dog, I may do with what little time I had.\""]
["07:26,440","07:40,120","\"What the fuck he has won too? It seems I'm not the only traitor. I must kill everyone.\""]
["07:40,120","07:43,000","\"Here he's an easy kill.\""]
["07:43,960","07:51,560","\"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. A bear trap, my leg. It doesn't matter. I'll still take away\""]
["07:51,560","07:56,280","\"your dear life you screw the diver looking prick. He screams at others to get to safety.\""]
["07:56,280","08:02,040","\"A foolish move, a man dragging a body runs out in fear and now I have my chance.\""]
["08:02,040","08:05,960","\"Another rush of euphoria.\""]
["08:05,960","08:10,840","\"Ouch, he throws shards of broken glass, hitting me in the chest.\""]
["08:11,480","08:15,720","\"A crowbar to my back. That's not enough to stop me you son of a snake.\""]
["08:15,720","08:17,080","\"Ow, a robot?\""]
["08:17,080","08:18,920","\"No life to take.\""]
["08:18,920","08:21,800","\"Don't waste my time with these games.\""]
["08:21,800","08:22,840","\"You're all dead.\""]
["08:22,840","08:25,160","\"Please, don't.\""]
["08:25,160","08:27,640","\"Please, don't kill me.\""]
["08:27,640","08:32,360","\"Well then.\""]
