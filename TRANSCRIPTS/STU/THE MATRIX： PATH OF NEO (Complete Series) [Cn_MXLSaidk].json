["45:06,660","45:13,420","\"Think about that freaks me out. I would need to see the guy who invented teleportation like do it\""]
["45:13,420","45:18,340","\"Like could you do it a few times before I try yeah?\""]
["45:18,340","45:24,620","\"Yeah, if it did just like wipe you clean from one location and create you perfectly from another there would still be no way to find out\""]
["45:24,620","45:26,620","\"What they're I guess not\""]
["45:26,620","45:34,220","\"But at least if that's how it worked the dude who invented it would probably know that and not want to use it, you know\""]
["45:34,780","45:40,060","\"It's pretty hard to invent something if you don't like basically understand it right true\""]

["46:04,980","46:13,420","\"That's true. I don't think we need teleportation like in the sense of turning somebody into a bunch of little tiny particles and rebuilding them\""]
["46:13,420","46:18,160","\"If we can figure out like controlled wormholes where you literally can just like\""]
["46:18,160","46:24,340","\"Pinch space time together and like step through the little pinch. Oh, I can wrinkle in time. Yeah\""]
