["00:04,000","00:06,000","\"That's whatever.\""]
["00:06,000","00:11,000","\"You weren't there. You weren't an ancient Greece. You don't know that we weren't gods living among us.\""]
["00:11,000","00:16,000","\"You don't know about my friend, Greeceius, the Greekest man of all?\""]
["00:16,000","00:21,000","\"What about the ancient iPad tablets that show all the history from the time?\""]
["00:21,000","00:24,000","\"Oh yeah. The Pompeii pad?\""]
["00:24,000","00:25,000","\"The Pompeii pad?\""]
["00:25,000","00:28,000","\"I love people from Pompeii. They're Pompeii people!\""]
["00:28,000","00:39,940","\"people. What they use that sound effect. I could swear that I used to have that sound\""]
["00:39,940","00:45,220","\"effect. Everyone has that sound effect. And overuse the shit out of it way back in the\""]
["00:45,220","00:52,880","\"day. I've given you a very funny book. Please read through all of my cool jokes. Oh, okay.\""]
["00:52,880","00:54,600","\"So now we have the Codex.\""]
["00:54,600","00:57,840","\"Now you have little records of all their guys\""]
["00:57,840","00:58,880","\"and your relationships.\""]
["00:58,880","01:00,800","\"- Ooh, okay, Tomar.\""]
["01:00,800","01:03,600","\"Who is the most likely to shake your hand?\""]
["01:03,600","01:07,880","\"- Out of all these, I would just choose Poseidon or Zeus.\""]
["01:07,880","01:08,720","\"- You think?\""]
["01:08,720","01:10,180","\"Not Dionysus?\""]
["01:10,180","01:11,840","\"- He seems cool.\""]
["01:11,840","01:14,240","\"Why is Zeus being so nice to Hades' son?\""]
["01:14,240","01:15,320","\"I really like Poseidon.\""]
["01:15,320","01:18,480","\"- Okay, so none of them actually can hear you.\""]
["01:18,480","01:21,120","\"They basically just are sending you one way messages.\""]
["01:21,120","01:22,040","\"- Oh, yeah.\""]
["01:22,040","01:25,560","\"They think that you're gonna get out and hang out with them.\""]
["01:25,560","01:29,080","\"Is this based on like real mythology?\""]
["01:29,080","01:30,760","\"Yeah, as a little bit.\""]
["01:30,760","01:35,180","\"Obviously I mean like obviously it's based on the mythology but the guy that you're\""]
["01:35,180","01:38,960","\"playing as is a part of his mythology that he wants to escape.\""]
["01:38,960","01:41,160","\"The guy that you're playing at is...\""]
["01:41,160","01:42,160","\"He's not made up.\""]
["01:42,160","01:43,160","\"No.\""]
["01:43,160","01:44,160","\"He's real.\""]
["01:44,160","01:45,160","\"Oh there's Meg.\""]
["01:45,160","01:48,360","\"And don't think you're gonna be so lucky next to meet out there.\""]
["01:48,360","01:49,760","\"What's your problem?\""]
["01:49,760","01:50,760","\"You did kill her.\""]
["01:50,760","01:52,120","\"Okay\""]
["01:52,120","01:54,640","\"But yeah, so the guy the guy you're playing as\""]
["01:54,640","02:00,780","\"He kind of exists because you know the way that wasn't the character called Zagreus\""]
["02:00,780","02:07,200","\"Yeah, but he might have turned into Hades or he might have turned into like Dionysus not like turned into him in mythology\""]
["02:07,200","02:09,880","\"like he was like a first draft of like\""]
["02:09,880","02:13,640","\"Other mythology figures like he's kind of he's there\""]
["02:13,640","02:17,840","\"But he wasn't really written a lot about\""]
["02:18,120","02:23,220","\"So people just think that like they might have just made him into Dionysus or into Hades or something\""]
["02:23,220","02:25,640","\"Can I at least give Skelly a gift?\""]
["02:25,640","02:28,600","\"You can but you're not allowed to use it\""]
["02:28,600","02:33,380","\"Okay, the first gift you give each one they give you a trinket. Oh\""]
["02:33,380","02:37,340","\"See we just got the lucky tooth or keep sick\""]
["02:37,340","02:41,520","\"That's what they're called and then all your keepsakes are kept in here. Oh, that's cool\""]
["02:41,520","02:46,060","\"So that one I won't select it, but it gives you an extra depth of fine if you did have it\""]
["02:46,060","02:49,620","\"See it gives you basically you get an extra life with 50 health\""]
["02:49,620","02:55,400","\"All right, I'm gonna escape with your stats. So Mar time. It's Tomar time\""]
["02:55,400","02:59,980","\"Everybody to that toe mark everybody to\""]
["02:59,980","03:04,620","\"Like I love the art in this area God of wine\""]
["03:04,620","03:07,020","\"Yeah\""]
["03:07,020","03:13,220","\"See that God of porn drunken strike or drunken flery that would have been a better game than God of War\""]
["03:14,860","03:21,580","\"I'm just gonna go for drunken strike straight out of the gate. They're gonna get slightly more degenerate with porn every year me\""]
["03:21,580","03:27,060","\"No the porn industry. Oh, yeah, you know, I love this area. This is my favorite looking area\""]
["03:27,060","03:32,300","\"This one is the first one. Yeah, this is pretty I actually do like a lazy. I'm like\""]
["03:32,300","03:34,740","\"I was really cool. So many levels are there\""]
["03:34,740","03:43,060","\"There's one more after a lazy. I'm are you serious? Yeah, there's four levels, but it's that one's also the shortest typically\""]
["03:43,060","03:49,380","\"It can be it's structured a little bit differently. It's it's got like there's a bit of a dice rolliness to it\""]
["03:49,380","03:51,580","\"So the game doesn't end when you beat it\""]
["03:51,580","03:56,520","\"All right, it kind of does but it kind of doesn't I don't want to ruin anything\""]
["03:56,520","04:02,220","\"Yeah, the story continues for long after like you you beat it God say that\""]
["04:02,220","04:06,620","\"It's very interesting\""]
["04:06,620","04:12,480","\"It's crazy that they made that work like yeah, and that's the cool thing about this game is it's like a story-driven\""]
["04:12,480","04:18,720","\"driven roguelike. Even Meg showing up and being like, \"\"Hey, fuck you for killing me.\"\"\""]
["04:18,720","04:22,860","\"Like shit like that. Like if she kills you, she'll be there anyway and she'll be like,\""]
["04:22,860","04:31,260","\"\"\"Hey, I beat your ass.\"\" So like, it'll react to what you're doing in really dynamic ways.\""]
["04:31,260","04:41,680","\"Like I've played a shit ton of it and I still have not heard R\""]
["04:41,680","04:45,280","\"Or maybe at some point they eventually do and you've like completed everything.\""]
["04:45,280","04:47,520","\"I mean there's gotta be a fucking lid on it right?\""]
["04:47,520","04:52,960","\"Because physically just people have to record all those lines.\""]
["04:52,960","04:57,040","\"They can't be like staying one piano lesson ahead of us you know what I mean?\""]
["04:57,040","05:02,960","\"This is probably a stupid-ass question but degree people still believe in these gods and shit.\""]
["05:02,960","05:08,160","\"No why not? Because they made a helicopter and they went to the top of it and they were like\""]
["05:08,160","05:08,880","\"there's nothing here.\""]
["05:09,840","05:11,840","\"There I created a little riff now\""]
["05:11,840","05:15,000","\"Yeah, oh, yeah\""]
["05:15,000","05:20,360","\"This kind of happens when you tie your religion to a physical place that you can actually get to the top of oh\""]
["05:20,360","05:26,240","\"Yeah, the Japanese had that going against the two that their emperor was like supposed to be like\""]
["05:26,240","05:33,800","\"Some agent of God and then he went on the radio and said he wasn't because they lost World War two bomb by hero. Yeah, I'm saki\""]
["05:33,800","05:36,280","\"gunuchi\""]
["05:36,280","05:38,280","\"We that's that's false\""]
["05:38,280","05:42,280","\"Guys, I'm just gonna say it. We bombed them, okay?\""]
["05:42,280","05:44,280","\"The Irish? Yeah.\""]
["05:44,280","05:48,280","\"County Wexford bombed on a sake in Hiroshima.\""]
["05:48,280","05:50,280","\"I fucking knew it.\""]
["05:50,280","05:54,280","\"It was purely because we were afraid of what we didn't understand.\""]
["05:54,280","05:58,280","\"Yeah, you guys need to stop doing that.\""]
["05:58,280","06:01,280","\"We did. We haven't done it since.\""]
["06:01,280","06:05,280","\"That's fair. But I see you thinking about it.\""]
["06:05,280","06:08,160","\"I threw up my chin and pondered it a lot.\""]
["06:08,160","06:12,120","\"What if we do it again?\""]
["06:12,120","06:15,040","\"This time we've learned from our mistakes.\""]
["06:15,040","06:16,040","\"Shara!\""]
["06:16,040","06:20,520","\"But we're fucking the Osbornes and their fucking Rancid family.\""]
["06:20,520","06:21,520","\"Why did anyone watch that?\""]
["06:21,520","06:25,920","\"I don't know, same reason people watch any other fucking horrible family.\""]

["10:20,120","10:23,600","\"No, but I've like I've tried\""]
["10:24,520","10:30,920","\"I've tried looking into this stuff for ball books. I wanted to include some cool stuff, but I can't find anything worth using it\""]
["10:30,920","10:39,160","\"So it's so shit man. I keep getting like one path rooms. There's a land called Tiernanog. I've heard Tiernanog where you go there\""]
["10:39,160","10:40,320","\"And you don't die\""]

["11:37,320","11:41,640","\"I really does help that they got all these like really good actors for this game.\""]
["11:41,640","11:43,160","\"Me and Tomer were talking about it lately,\""]
["11:43,160","11:46,980","\"But nothing's more fucking annoying than a main character who never just like calms down\""]
["11:46,980","11:51,160","\"They're always just yelling every line and they're over excited about quite literally everything\""]
["11:51,160","11:57,820","\"I've seen so much modern games where like the main character will just be like yelling every fucking you're using the same\""]
["11:57,820","12:00,340","\"No, I'm using the same shit. I just wanted to show Chris this\""]
["12:00,340","12:05,960","\"Oh, look at this one's this one's cool. Yeah, you can throw it and like make it come back to you like Captain America\""]
["12:05,960","12:07,960","\"Yeah, I like that\""]
["12:08,500","12:12,060","\"But I'm doing the same thing as all the rest of you okay\""]
["12:12,060","12:17,100","\"I think Chris might be able to get fucking farther than both of us just because he got that hammer\""]
["12:17,100","12:19,020","\"I think I would I think if I hadn't risked\""]
["12:19,020","12:25,380","\"But it was stupid of me to take it that late in the level the like 20 health thing when I hadn't gained any HP\""]
["12:25,380","12:27,620","\"Yeah, I might not have gone for it, but\""]
["12:27,620","12:30,100","\"Hermes\""]
["12:30,100","12:37,180","\"God of feathers on his head and feet. Yeah, Hermes is good because he can put feathers anywhere he wants and he doesn't interfere with anything else\""]

["12:42,300","12:45,220","\"See you and I can you can get to the point\""]
["12:45,220","12:50,820","\"I've had I've had points where I could - five times in a row just based on boons. I got yep\""]
["12:50,820","12:57,220","\"Here's the thing though. Would you guys not get sick of doing the same levels over and over and over? No, why not?\""]
