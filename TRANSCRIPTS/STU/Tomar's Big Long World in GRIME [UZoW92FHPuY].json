["01:02,600","01:08,680","\"That other game thing where different weapons scale off different traits\""]
["01:08,680","01:13,520","\"So once we find one that we're like I'm attached to this then maybe we can uh\""]
["01:13,520","01:17,120","\"We can start leveling that up, but right now I think health is\""]
["01:17,120","01:19,840","\"pretty safe, right?\""]
["01:19,840","01:23,200","\"No, no one's gonna kill kill you for getting more health\""]

["04:57,000","04:58,000","\"Oh.\""]
["04:58,000","04:59,840","\"I don't want you bathing in this premise.\""]
["04:59,840","05:01,580","\"Well done.\""]
["05:01,580","05:04,240","\"You found the secret.\""]
["05:04,240","05:06,800","\"So you found this cave, hmm?\""]
["05:06,800","05:08,480","\"This is the one he was telling me about.\""]
["05:08,480","05:11,560","\"Oh he even left me a little charm.\""]
["05:11,560","05:12,560","\"That was him?\""]
["05:12,560","05:13,560","\"That was where he was?\""]
["05:13,560","05:14,560","\"No I don't think that was where he was.\""]
["05:14,560","05:15,820","\"I'm pretty sure it was.\""]
["05:15,820","05:17,020","\"I don't think so.\""]
["05:17,020","05:19,420","\"I'm pretty sure it kind of wasn't where he was.\""]
["05:19,420","05:20,460","\"Have you gone right yet?\""]
["05:20,460","05:21,460","\"Yeah, you go right.\""]
["05:21,460","05:22,620","\"No, I haven't gone either way.\""]
["05:22,620","05:23,420","\"Yeah, that's true.\""]
["05:23,420","05:25,540","\"You can make lots of decisions here.\""]
["05:25,540","05:27,580","\"He's going to get slapped.\""]
["05:27,580","05:29,460","\"The great thing about forking paths\""]
["05:29,460","05:30,980","\"is that no matter which way you go,\""]
["05:30,980","05:33,020","\"someone will want you to go the other way.\""]
["05:33,020","05:33,860","\"You know?\""]
["05:33,860","05:37,700","\"My mom told me that before you, you know,\""]
["05:37,700","05:41,420","\"she went one way and, you know--\""]
["05:41,420","05:43,220","\"Oh, I pressed the wrong bumper.\""]
["05:43,220","05:48,380","\"I think we all know the story from there, but yeah, okay. You just want to do that same thing\""]
["05:48,380","05:52,020","\"Let's start from miles beginning like in mega mind\""]
["05:52,020","05:57,740","\"Does do you see mega mind get birthed at the beginning of mega mind because I'm actually curious how he fit out\""]
["05:57,740","05:59,740","\"It's like a superman\""]
["05:59,740","06:06,220","\"I love mega mind should I drop on down? Yeah, that's what I wanted you to do\""]
["06:06,220","06:11,700","\"So I mean if you're a beta and you're taking orders from him\""]
["06:12,140","06:14,140","\"Then yeah, maybe you drop down\""]
["06:14,140","06:21,060","\"Be careful you son of a gun yeah, you really got to kind of learn the timings on them. I guess I do\""]
["06:21,060","06:24,860","\"He's gonna wreck me just fuck him up. Just hit him\""]
["06:24,860","06:31,300","\"Why do you want boy should I should I take it back or?\""]
["06:31,300","06:39,180","\"I got this all right if you're feeling confident last chance Tom wears last chance. Oh no\""]
["06:39,180","06:41,180","\"This is your last chance, huh?\""]
["06:41,180","06:43,180","\"This is your last resort.\""]
["06:43,180","06:46,180","\"See, I'm working this up. I think this will get us there a bit quicker now.\""]
["06:46,180","06:48,180","\"I've heard Tomer say that one before.\""]
["06:48,180","06:51,180","\"Yeah, he kind of takes the long cuts.\""]
["06:51,180","06:54,180","\"But that's okay. That's one of his quirks.\""]
["06:54,180","06:56,180","\"And pulling his ass open?\""]
["06:56,180","06:58,180","\"That is more than a quirk.\""]
["06:58,180","06:59,180","\"That's a trait.\""]
["06:59,180","07:00,180","\"Go.\""]
["07:00,180","07:01,180","\"Oh.\""]
["07:01,180","07:02,180","\"Yeah, you're good.\""]
["07:02,180","07:03,180","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["07:03,180","07:06,180","\"Fuck it. I always want to hit the left fucking...\""]
["07:06,180","07:07,180","\"Go on.\""]
["07:07,180","07:08,180","\"Alright, alright.\""]
["07:08,180","07:11,180","\"Alright, the magic tomorra.\""]
["07:11,180","07:14,180","\"I would have timed it perfectly if I hit the right bumper instead of the left bumper.\""]
["07:14,180","07:16,180","\"Who puts a parry on the right side?\""]
["07:16,180","07:19,180","\"I would have parried at that time if I wasn't for that meddling bumper.\""]
["07:19,180","07:22,180","\"I would have done great had I not done shit.\""]
["07:22,180","07:27,180","\"I'm sorry, tomorra. I don't mean to poke fun at you at your lowest moment.\""]
["07:27,180","07:29,180","\"*chuckles*\""]
["07:29,180","07:30,180","\"*chuckles*\""]
["07:30,180","07:34,180","\"Tomorra, you should tell the audience about your new pedigree breeding scheme.\""]
["07:34,180","07:35,180","\"That's not what?\""]
["07:35,180","07:36,180","\"Not public yet.\""]
["07:36,180","07:43,380","\"Look at it. It's not real. Oh, my has a puppy mill where he lets little puppies get born and he breeds them so that they all have specific features\""]
["07:43,380","07:45,380","\"It's really cute. It's not true\""]
["07:45,380","07:50,900","\"And though some of them do get a lot of ticks\""]
["07:50,900","07:56,280","\"It's still worth the end result where a family gets very happy when they get their new little puppy with a short nose\""]
["07:56,280","08:00,980","\"Yeah, right Tomar. I don't know I don't approve of puppy mills or\""]
["08:02,740","08:10,620","\"It's adorable when a family gives their daughter an animal that she has no no business being responsible for and she gets bored of it in a week\""]
["08:10,620","08:15,220","\"It's really cute though when the kids come in and Tomer's like that and that did that puppy power and he brings up the puppy\""]
["08:15,220","08:17,960","\"He picks the ticks off for free. He gets it in the kids\""]
["08:17,960","08:21,300","\"I've seen it. It's really cute\""]
["08:21,300","08:27,900","\"Tomer's passionate. I think you should try going down there down here going down to Tomer's puppy mill\""]
["08:27,900","08:31,620","\"Go on down\""]
["08:31,620","08:39,900","\"You know, Tomar, if you start any of these enterprises that Chris nudge nudge wink wink jokingly talks about on oni plays\""]
["08:39,900","08:46,720","\"That'd be like a free commercial right there that you just got. I'm not gonna do that. I know you're not wink\""]
["08:46,720","08:49,700","\"But if why not what's the problem here, huh?\""]
["08:49,700","08:53,140","\"You described all the reasons why not\""]
["08:53,140","08:58,880","\"Living on a nice farm. What's fucked up is putting him in a tiny condo Tomar\""]
["08:59,860","09:02,620","\"Which I I live in a small condo\""]
["09:02,620","09:06,140","\"50 fucking puppies\""]
["09:06,140","09:09,880","\"Covered text for no reason one black cat\""]
["09:09,880","09:17,980","\"Why was a rescue by the way he bred to be black from a normal white cat who was a rescue?\""]
["09:17,980","09:22,860","\"You rescued it from a happy family you stole it\""]
["09:22,860","09:26,340","\"It's not true. Oh\""]
["09:26,340","09:29,660","\"Why'd you do I Michael Jackson\""]
["09:29,660","09:33,160","\"Oh my god, I think you're gonna have to parry a lot against this guy\""]
["09:33,160","09:36,200","\"You would think that wouldn't you honky?\""]
["09:36,200","09:43,140","\"You can dash through them can't ash through them. So that munch you is that what how - and then do the parry again\""]
["09:43,140","09:46,160","\"Okay, I see oh, okay. That's a reds that\""]
["09:46,160","09:50,020","\"Bloink\""]
["09:50,020","09:55,100","\"It looks like Voldemort. Yeah, oh my god, dude. That is fucking metal. I\""]
["09:55,100","09:59,100","\"Bet you can oh boy\""]
["09:59,100","10:08,180","\"Be careful, Neil. Do I hit the middle? Yep. Oh, you can't block in midair. Well, you have Harry those fingers. Oh god. Yeah\""]
["10:08,180","10:17,020","\"Well done, can you not parry the hands anymore? Oh, no, no one there. No one they're doing that. That's right red stuff. Oh\""]
["10:17,020","10:21,620","\"That movie movie probably could have probably been\""]
["10:21,620","10:27,960","\"Well, I think you did great for your first time. I think that maybe that move that that move you could carry the\""]
["10:27,960","10:35,160","\"I mean this game is designed I assume to be like somewhat difficult you mean like that that one game\""]
["10:35,160","10:38,840","\"No, I don't mean that at all. Tomer loves the backseat breed\""]
["10:38,840","10:41,640","\"Backseat breed\""]
["10:41,640","10:43,640","\"He keeps telling me how to do it\""]
["10:43,640","10:49,480","\"I want a game where you don't fight things you just talk it out and it's not undertale\""]
["10:49,480","10:54,440","\"Why does it have to not be undertale\""]
["10:54,600","10:56,600","\"Because I want another game where you do that.\""]
["10:56,600","10:57,600","\"But it's not undertale.\""]
["10:57,600","10:59,600","\"Because you loved Undertale so much...\""]
["10:59,600","11:00,600","\"Uh...\""]
["11:00,600","11:03,600","\"That you want more of it, right?\""]
["11:03,600","11:04,600","\"Uh...\""]
["11:04,600","11:05,600","\"Give me that back!\""]
["11:05,600","11:07,600","\"No, why is it stuck?\""]
["11:07,600","11:09,600","\"Keep hitting it.\""]
["11:09,600","11:10,600","\"Oh!\""]
["11:10,600","11:12,600","\"I started straight from the...\""]
["11:12,600","11:13,600","\"Oh shit!\""]
["11:13,600","11:14,600","\"Yeah, you did.\""]

["11:15,600","11:16,600","\"Or I guess...\""]
["11:16,600","11:18,600","\"I guess all I did was counter it, but...\""]
["11:18,600","11:19,600","\"Ow!\""]
["11:19,600","11:21,600","\"It seemed like when it nudged that one little bit\""]
["11:21,600","11:23,600","\"you probably could have parried it also.\""]
["11:23,600","11:30,460","\"Oh god. Yeah, you can't really like things hit hard hit your right trigger. Yeah, oh god jump over that ah\""]
["11:30,460","11:35,680","\"I should have dodged into it or something. It's okay, bro. This is the first scary boss\""]
["11:35,680","11:40,640","\"It really wants us to feel powerless so that when we defeated we feel really good and our dope amines go\""]
["11:40,640","11:44,680","\"Yeah, I'm just I'm just getting too greedy slapping it\""]
["11:44,680","11:49,240","\"This is really a game where you gotta like not do that greedy lile just slapping it don't know that that\""]
["11:52,880","11:58,060","\"Who do you last lab would it did it it I love this thing I don't I love this thing\""]

["18:59,640","19:03,940","\"I think so unless it's it's like a no. I can't even use it. Yeah, okay\""]
["19:03,940","19:07,600","\"So that is also the equippability. Yeah, I\""]
["19:07,600","19:14,960","\"Want it though, I guess the the weapon I'm currently using scales just as well as strength as it does with decks\""]
