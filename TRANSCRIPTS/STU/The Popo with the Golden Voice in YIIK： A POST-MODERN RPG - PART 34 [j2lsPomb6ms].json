["00:07,500","00:12,000","\"I am always here for you. I want to help you be the best that you can be.\""]
["00:12,000","00:16,000","\"Can't you help me be the me that saves this reality?\""]
["00:16,000","00:19,000","\"Whatever the hell all these things are falling from the sky?\""]
["00:19,000","00:24,000","\"It is impossible, but if you would like to try, we may try.\""]
["00:24,000","00:27,000","\"It pleases me that you want to fight for something.\""]
["00:27,000","00:35,000","\"I know this isn't your usual way. It throws me to see this fashion in you. Together, we can attempt to fight this end of reality.\""]
["00:35,000","00:37,000","\"Her face is jittering around.\""]
["00:37,000","00:40,000","\"It's been doing it this whole time. It's really distracting.\""]
["00:40,000","00:42,000","\"Don't be such a downer.\""]
["00:42,000","00:46,000","\"Listen, listen here, evil robot.\""]
["00:46,000","00:50,000","\"Just cuz everything is gonna end. You don't have to be depressing about it.\""]
["00:50,000","00:54,000","\"I understand now that in your heart there is no other choice.\""]
["00:54,000","00:57,280","\"Perhaps you, Alex, are different from the others.\""]
["00:57,280","00:59,340","\"I will stay and fight with you.\""]
["00:59,340","01:01,300","\"Like we are going to do this.\""]
["01:01,300","01:03,520","\"We must convince your friends to help us.\""]
["01:03,520","01:05,360","\"Like the music of Yami too.\""]
["01:05,360","01:07,760","\"Even I am not at my most powerful.\""]
["01:07,760","01:10,860","\"We must complete the mind-dention before the end comes,\""]
["01:10,860","01:12,660","\"and be prepared to fight it.\""]
["01:12,660","01:15,100","\"How do we convince them that the world is gonna end?\""]
["01:15,100","01:18,600","\"By convincing them that this reality will soon perish,\""]
["01:18,600","01:23,840","\"and by making them understand that this world is just a byproduct of that destruction.\""]
["01:23,840","01:28,360","\"Okay, so what's this great destruction that will be obliterating reality?\""]
["01:28,360","01:34,360","\"It's the same destruction that destroys all realities, but yet I can't be the name.\""]
["01:34,360","01:38,840","\"Oh my god, he's asked you like four times what it is and once I...\""]
["01:38,840","01:45,720","\"It's super frustrating. Just fucking say things. One of my pet peeves is absolutely when...\""]
["01:45,720","01:47,680","\"People don't communicate.\""]
["01:47,680","01:53,080","\"I think one of my pet peeves is when you recognize it and you have a line where you say, \"\"I'm not an anime character.\"\"\""]
["01:53,240","01:55,240","\"But then you draw it out anyways\""]
["01:55,240","01:59,200","\"World going to end that was the that was the gist of that\""]
["01:59,200","02:04,760","\"Just like Resident Evil 5 4. Sorry the white 2k problem. I got confused cuz fire\""]
["02:04,760","02:09,240","\"I'm just gonna say problem that it only has five chapters. I love this screen\""]
["02:09,240","02:11,640","\"I wish Alex's head would pop up sir talking to me\""]
["02:11,640","02:14,640","\"So\""]
["02:20,560","02:23,120","\"Your friends just left you here for an entire season.\""]
["02:23,120","02:25,620","\"Is the implication that he just vanished?\""]
["02:25,620","02:28,120","\"Maybe they're cheeses in this van.\""]
["02:28,120","02:29,280","\"You steal it?\""]
["02:29,280","02:31,120","\"I have seen any realities.\""]
["02:31,120","02:35,000","\"And this one is by far the least prepared for proper transportation.\""]
["02:35,000","02:36,560","\"Oh, commentary.\""]
["02:36,560","02:37,560","\"Fighting.\""]
["02:37,560","02:38,560","\"Oh boy.\""]
["02:38,560","02:41,760","\"So we really can't drive it.\""]
["02:41,760","02:42,760","\"I guess not.\""]
["02:42,760","02:43,760","\"You pee.\""]
["02:43,760","02:46,960","\"But we got the keys to the van and every...\""]
["02:46,960","02:49,160","\"It's not that far.\""]
["02:49,160","02:51,320","\"Don't know why they're making such a big deal out of it\""]
["02:51,320","02:54,540","\"Why didn't they just let me think you can feel inconvenient\""]
["02:54,540","02:59,400","\"If you just had to walk and they didn't say anything it probably wouldn't been a big deal\""]
["02:59,400","03:04,360","\"But we're in the endgame now usually in like an RPG. They'll give you some cool way to transfer shit\""]
["03:04,360","03:08,280","\"Sorry, actually it's autumn ignore all the snow. We just saw it. What's the fuck? Oh?\""]
["03:08,280","03:15,200","\"Look they re-enabled encounters. The overworld wasn't doing this. I assume it's gonna be like higher level stuff now, right?\""]
["03:15,200","03:17,200","\"I would assume oh\""]
["03:17,840","03:23,240","\"It's our friend sheep man. Yeah, it's different enemies these guys usually don't spawn. I hate you sheep man\""]
["03:23,240","03:26,800","\"Oops, you probably killed it\""]
["03:26,800","03:41,480","\"Okay, now you killed it don't hurt me sheep man\""]
["03:41,480","03:45,160","\"What does sheep man do if he hits you puts you to sleep?\""]
["03:46,160","03:48,520","\"That makes sense because he's a sheep. Oh\""]
["03:48,520","03:51,160","\"No\""]
["03:51,160","03:54,320","\"Doesn't it suck when they set you up like that yeah\""]
["03:54,320","04:00,760","\"They'll be fine work. Yeah, it did good. Yeah, it's maybe a little too good of an ability\""]
["04:00,760","04:06,320","\"Even with the changes made I'm just glad I didn't have to find sheep bad for too long\""]
["04:06,320","04:13,040","\"So go peer to the left. Yeah, that town at the very time pretty sure they have a bus stop has a bus stop you can see it\""]
["04:13,040","04:14,480","\"Okay\""]
["04:14,480","04:16,480","\"Let me end damn it\""]
["04:16,480","04:18,680","\"Thank fuck. We only have to fight sheep man once\""]
["04:18,680","04:25,200","\"Technically there were two of them. Oh, it's winter here. Why don't they have winter for the overworld?\""]
["04:25,200","04:31,480","\"Literally because the game is set up with like solid colors. It's the easiest. Yeah, you just tint it differently\""]
["04:31,480","04:34,040","\"You literally just slide the color into white\""]
["04:34,040","04:40,200","\"It's an art style that's easily catered around that and that's the whole point to it\""]
["04:40,200","04:43,240","\"But whatever\""]
["04:43,680","04:45,680","\"You didn't make this I\""]
["04:45,680","04:51,780","\"Think it's a miracle. He even finished it. It's a stone Luigi. I mean, I would say it's impressive. Yeah, it's got like a\""]
["04:51,780","04:58,600","\"Getting a full game out is a fucking hard thing to do especially one of this scope. Yeah\""]
["04:58,600","05:05,740","\"And I feel like an RPG is probably one of the more content heavy games that you can make right yeah\""]
["05:05,740","05:10,400","\"And I do like most of it except for the dungeons and the fighting\""]
["05:11,280","05:13,280","\"And the gameplay and then sometimes the writing\""]
["05:13,280","05:23,000","\"Okay, yeah, you can't dying\""]
["05:23,000","05:26,520","\"You fucking making into a joke\""]

["06:00,960","06:02,960","\"Oh, they did care.\""]
["06:02,960","06:05,960","\"Sometimes a panicked mother was worse than impending doom.\""]
["06:05,960","06:08,960","\"And where are the groceries?\""]
["06:08,960","06:11,460","\"A year later.\""]

["08:04,400","08:05,560","\"What are you doing?\""]
["08:05,560","08:07,480","\"More programming.\""]
["08:07,480","08:09,360","\"I got hired by Moon macro systems\""]

["08:22,920","08:29,580","\"We did watch it. We're in a cutscene though. A month ago. It's just his mom. She's not\""]
["08:29,580","08:33,920","\"gonna have any insights about the universe. Excuse me. She has a green-haired lady in\""]
["08:33,920","08:38,260","\"front of her right now. This is pretty different for her. People are afraid the world is going\""]
["08:38,260","08:44,600","\"to end. So we might as well capitalize on that fear. Yeah, fuck all those programmers\""]
["08:44,600","08:50,920","\"that were fixing Y2K bugs. What greedy assholes. I mean, people made light of what the whole\""]
["08:50,920","08:54,640","\"Yeah, that's why it's weird to me that they're choosing that angle\""]
["08:54,640","09:01,440","\"Should we be worried about why to the reason that Y2K wasn't really a big deal is because a lot of people were working hard to take care of it early on\""]
["09:01,440","09:10,040","\"Not unless you're a machine\""]
["09:10,040","09:15,040","\"Yeah\""]

["09:42,920","09:46,560","\"I mean Chris. That's the easy go to for the day now. I know\""]
["09:47,160","09:49,160","\"Reality's falling apart anything\""]
["09:49,160","09:55,040","\"Anything could be deliberate. Let's go do homework with my new girl. It's kind of genius you have to admit\""]
["09:55,040","09:59,020","\"You wouldn't be concerned. I guess you set up a safety net for yourself\""]
["09:59,020","10:03,800","\"So you could write whatever you want. I didn't Chris you went to college. They don't give you homework, right?\""]
["10:03,800","10:06,440","\"They can do yeah, they can\""]
["10:06,440","10:07,800","\"Wow\""]

["10:27,340","10:34,060","\"Yes, yes, it's gonna end. This is no time for jokes. That's the perfect time for jokes\""]

["11:09,560","11:26,120","\"Can't tell a good joke she can't be concise she tell a joke about a priest and a rabbi going into a bar\""]
["11:26,120","11:29,280","\"But then we go into really vivid detail about all their backstory\""]
["11:29,280","11:33,720","\"The priest came from Bulgaria he came over on the\""]

["12:32,960","12:40,120","\"Come over and I'll explain what happened. You want me to call the others? I'll tell the others, but I think you need to hear it first\""]
