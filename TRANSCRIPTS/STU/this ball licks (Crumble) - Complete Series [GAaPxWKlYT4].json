["00:07,320","00:11,280","\"I might have believed that your consciousness is downloaded into that small creature.\""]
["00:11,280","00:13,800","\"Zoom in. Zoom in. What does the term \"\"limp\"\" it mean? I...\""]
["00:13,800","00:14,480","\"Yeah, what's a limp?\""]
["00:14,480","00:17,480","\"That's, I think that's the first time I've ever heard it spoken aloud.\""]
["00:17,480","00:18,960","\"It's like a...\""]

["00:37,200","00:38,300","\"Have you now?\""]
["00:38,300","00:41,000","\"Yeah, we played the demo and it was a lot of fun.\""]

["00:43,400","00:46,600","\"That sound again.\""]
["00:46,600","00:48,900","\"That all familiar sound.\""]

["00:50,400","00:51,700","\"It reminds me of all.\""]

["00:53,200","00:55,300","\"Oh, you better write it fast.\""]
["00:55,300","00:59,520","\"- It only has about like 15 feet of history.\""]
["00:59,520","01:05,060","\"- 15 feet of history is what I call my dick.\""]
["01:05,060","01:07,180","\"- This is just gonna be the dick episode.\""]
["01:07,180","01:08,660","\"- That George Washington dick.\""]
["01:08,660","01:09,820","\"- I didn't even wait two minutes\""]

["01:10,980","01:13,020","\"- Jimmy Carter dick.\""]

["01:19,860","01:22,180","\"That feels good too.\""]
["01:22,180","01:25,060","\"- Is that your tongue or is that just a lot of your spittle?\""]
["01:25,060","01:27,060","\"It's my little spittle.\""]
["01:27,060","01:29,100","\"Oh, this is so fun to control.\""]

["01:33,420","01:35,300","\"- Nothing at all.\""]
["01:35,300","01:39,180","\"- This is just basically an advanced form of ball game.\""]
["01:39,180","01:40,820","\"- Oh my God, you're right.\""]
["01:40,820","01:42,620","\"I still can't wait for that XO1 game either.\""]
["01:42,620","01:43,740","\"- That game's sick. - I mean, that's the one\""]
["01:43,740","01:45,140","\"I was talking about, yeah.\""]
["01:45,140","01:45,980","\"- Oh, yeah.\""]
["01:45,980","01:49,060","\"- Anything with little balls bouncing around or flying\""]
["01:49,060","01:53,060","\"or swinging or singing or doing anything really.\""]
["01:53,060","01:54,260","\"- Well, more could you want in life.\""]
["01:54,260","01:56,180","\"This guy looks like gooey from Kirby.\""]
["01:56,180","01:57,980","\"You remember gooey from Kirby?\""]

["01:59,980","02:02,260","\"- The, uh, off for God. - Off for God.\""]
["02:02,260","02:03,420","\"- Gooey was not the fish.\""]
["02:03,420","02:05,180","\"Gooey was like the little blue guy\""]
["02:05,180","02:06,980","\"that shows up in Kirby 3.\""]
["02:06,980","02:07,820","\"- Oh.\""]
["02:07,820","02:09,320","\"- Who's basically, he's got the same powers\""]
["02:09,320","02:11,740","\"as Kirby except he licks and he looks almost exactly\""]
["02:11,740","02:14,500","\"like this and I'm connecting some dots here.\""]
["02:14,500","02:16,500","\"- I was gonna say, I was obsessed with Kirby 2\""]
["02:16,500","02:18,820","\"where they introduced the little animal friends,\""]
["02:18,820","02:20,580","\"but I don't know any of their names.\""]
["02:20,580","02:21,980","\"I don't think I ever did.\""]
["02:21,980","02:23,260","\"- This is the kind of game that feels good\""]
["02:23,260","02:33,260","\"just blast through it as fast as you can. You got it blast faster. I'm trying. No. Oh, yeah, you can do that. You saved it. Come on.\""]
["02:33,260","02:47,260","\"Recover, recover, recover. Oh, whoa, whoa. You can do it. I really think you can. Well, I almost did it. Yes. Oh, the return of the King. Did you ever imagine it would go like this? Yes.\""]
["02:47,260","02:48,100","\"- Yeah.\""]
["02:48,100","02:49,440","\"- Woo, no.\""]
["02:49,440","02:52,400","\"- You got it.\""]
["02:52,400","02:53,240","\"- Okay.\""]
["02:53,240","02:54,240","\"- Woo.\""]
["02:54,240","02:55,080","\"- There we go.\""]
["02:55,080","02:57,080","\"- I feel like you learned more struggling\""]
["02:57,080","02:59,180","\"up the side of those than you would have doing it\""]
["02:59,180","03:00,020","\"the right way.\""]
["03:00,020","03:00,860","\"- I told you I'm a--\""]
["03:00,860","03:02,880","\"- Or if the game had landed you with some annoying\""]
["03:02,880","03:06,560","\"tutorial level instead of just throwing you right into it.\""]
["03:06,560","03:08,080","\"- Yeah, no, thank God for this.\""]
["03:08,080","03:10,640","\"- I think we always learn best through failure.\""]
["03:10,640","03:12,640","\"Would you agree, Chris, that fear of failure\""]
["03:12,640","03:15,720","\"is the greatest obstruction to learning?\""]
["03:15,720","03:19,320","\"No, I think that people who fail from the beginning are losers that you give up.\""]
["03:19,320","03:20,520","\"*laughter*\""]
["03:20,520","03:21,420","\"I see.\""]
["03:21,420","03:23,420","\"Unless you get something perfect, you first try.\""]
["03:23,420","03:25,920","\"You heard it here, folks.\""]
["03:25,920","03:29,020","\"Don't pursue anything you can't get right on your first try.\""]
["03:29,020","03:29,920","\"Just drop it.\""]
["03:29,920","03:31,720","\"You clearly can't do it.\""]
["03:31,720","03:34,120","\"You either got it or you don't, okay?\""]
["03:34,120","03:36,320","\"As they say in the biz.\""]
["03:36,320","03:39,720","\"I used to believe that about everything.\""]
["03:39,720","03:40,520","\"Did you really?\""]
["03:40,520","03:41,920","\"Yeah, it's like, I can't do it.\""]
["03:41,920","03:42,420","\"This sucks.\""]
["03:42,420","03:43,220","\"I'm stupid.\""]
["03:43,220","03:45,420","\"Learning how to learn.\""]
["03:45,520","03:49,520","\"If that makes sense, is like a really valuable life skill in general.\""]
["03:49,520","03:54,320","\"Yeah, if anything, that's what the best thing you could take out of school.\""]
["03:54,320","03:56,920","\"Because nothing else will actually stick.\""]
["03:56,920","03:57,800","\"Right.\""]
["03:57,800","04:00,880","\"Except for that thing on your neck.\""]
["04:00,880","04:03,480","\"Then the lawsuits.\""]
["04:03,480","04:05,720","\"Well, I don't know why you had to bring up the thing on my neck.\""]
["04:05,720","04:09,200","\"Sorry. It's got to come up at least once a year by contrast.\""]
["04:09,200","04:10,240","\"Little benign, Tomar.\""]
["04:10,240","04:12,400","\"You're too, Mar.\""]
["04:12,400","04:14,640","\"See, I'm good.\""]
["04:14,640","04:15,320","\"I told you.\""]
["04:15,320","04:16,600","\"Only took me five minutes.\""]
["04:16,600","04:18,920","\"This is my Benignuetumar.\""]
["04:18,920","04:20,600","\"Benignuetumar.\""]
["04:20,600","04:22,600","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["04:22,600","04:25,400","\"Wow!\""]
["04:25,400","04:27,320","\"Does anyone else want to try?\""]
["04:27,320","04:28,240","\"I could.\""]
["04:28,240","04:28,920","\"Here, up we go.\""]
["04:28,920","04:29,800","\"It's fine.\""]
["04:29,800","04:31,800","\"Is the tongue like a right trigger?\""]
["04:31,800","04:32,800","\"Right trigger.\""]
["04:32,800","04:33,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:33,400","04:34,920","\"Where else would you put it after?\""]
["04:34,920","04:36,720","\"Are there any other buttons I even need to know?\""]
["04:36,720","04:37,800","\"Just jump.\""]
["04:37,800","04:38,560","\"Jump and tongue.\""]
["04:38,560","04:39,400","\"Okay.\""]
["04:39,400","04:39,960","\"Jump and tongue.\""]
["04:39,960","04:41,960","\"Jump and tongue.\""]
["04:41,960","04:43,920","\"There you go.\""]
["04:43,920","04:46,400","\"Oh, right trigger an A, what?\""]
["04:46,400","04:49,040","\"Right trigger an A at the same time.\""]
["04:49,040","04:50,560","\"I don't know that I get it.\""]
["04:50,560","04:51,400","\"Are you made of paint?\""]
["04:51,400","04:54,360","\"I don't know, I think that's supposed to be\""]
["04:54,360","04:55,800","\"like his little snail trail.\""]
["04:55,800","04:58,040","\"Like he's supposed to be like a goop.\""]
["04:58,040","05:00,320","\"I don't think I got what they were trying to teach me,\""]
["05:00,320","05:03,440","\"but what do you say was in five-hour energy?\""]
["05:03,440","05:06,880","\"B, vitamin B12 and caffeine.\""]
["05:06,880","05:07,800","\"And like everything.\""]
["05:07,800","05:10,040","\"And taurine, pretty much it's like a cocktail\""]
["05:10,040","05:11,920","\"to everything that is either proven\""]
["05:11,920","05:14,740","\"or just widely believed to give you energy.\""]
["05:14,740","05:16,580","\"- Chemical X.\""]
["05:16,580","05:17,420","\"- Do you hear that the guy who--\""]
["05:17,420","05:19,740","\"- The approach clearly isn't so great.\""]
["05:19,740","05:22,260","\"- Do you hear that the CEO of Five Hour Energy\""]
["05:22,260","05:24,540","\"is like trying to drill to the center of the earth\""]
["05:24,540","05:28,900","\"to create a massive like graphite wire that--\""]
["05:28,900","05:31,780","\"- I do recall that being real.\""]
["05:31,780","05:32,860","\"- It is real.\""]
["05:32,860","05:35,380","\"- You take that energy and you bring it up.\""]
["05:35,380","05:36,380","\"- He's a mad man.\""]
["05:36,380","05:38,420","\"No, he made this like series of like,\""]
["05:38,420","05:39,980","\"look at me, I'm a zillionaire.\""]
["05:39,980","05:42,640","\"So I'm putting all my money into crazy shit.\""]
["05:42,640","05:44,220","\"Some of it seemed practical,\""]
["05:44,220","05:46,340","\"some of it was just fucking dumb.\""]
["05:46,340","05:48,220","\"I don't think he's getting to the center of the earth.\""]
["05:48,220","05:49,680","\"I'm just gonna come out and say it.\""]
["05:49,680","05:51,780","\"But you know what, prove me wrong, asshole.\""]
["05:51,780","05:53,540","\"Get to the center of the earth.\""]
["05:53,540","05:55,020","\"- You should just buy a bucket of acid\""]
["05:55,020","05:56,020","\"and pour it on the ground.\""]
["05:56,020","05:57,780","\"- Yeah, that must be so fun.\""]
["05:57,780","05:59,620","\"Like I bet all the contractors,\""]
["05:59,620","06:01,620","\"he's hired or con artists.\""]
["06:01,620","06:03,620","\"- We can do that.\""]
["06:03,620","06:04,900","\"- We can do that.\""]
["06:04,900","06:07,980","\"It's just gonna take a long time and a lot of money\""]
["06:07,980","06:08,980","\"that's not in refundable.\""]
["06:08,980","06:12,980","\"We definitely need to figure out how to actually get up the walls properly.\""]
["06:12,980","06:14,420","\"Can I, can I try for a sec?\""]
["06:14,420","06:15,420","\"Oh, for sure.\""]
["06:15,420","06:16,420","\"Let me just-\""]
["06:16,420","06:19,820","\"There's one guy in the comedy who's actually punching his forehead with his palm right\""]
["06:19,820","06:20,820","\"now.\""]
["06:20,820","06:22,380","\"He's putting a hole in his dry wall.\""]
["06:22,380","06:25,380","\"Because we just failed a grasp at-\""]
["06:25,380","06:29,580","\"Did you guys ever have cousins growing up and they always had holes in their walls?\""]
["06:29,580","06:30,580","\"They didn't repair?\""]
["06:30,580","06:31,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:31,580","06:36,320","\"I guess not specifically cousins, but I certainly had friends.\""]
["06:36,320","06:39,020","\"What is it with males and putting holes in the wall?\""]
["06:39,020","06:40,020","\"It is kind of-\""]
["06:40,020","06:42,860","\"It's kind of fair drywall is pretty pathetically weak.\""]
["06:42,860","06:43,860","\"That's true.\""]
["06:43,860","06:47,560","\"It is super empowering when you actually find out that you're strong enough to do it.\""]
["06:47,560","06:48,560","\"Oh!\""]
["06:48,560","06:49,560","\"Wait.\""]
["06:49,560","06:53,040","\"You can jump up like that.\""]
["06:53,040","06:55,360","\"I guess that works.\""]
["06:55,360","06:56,360","\"See?\""]
["06:56,360","06:58,760","\"Is that what I was trying to teach you is just to go vertical?\""]
["06:58,760","06:59,760","\"I don't know.\""]
["06:59,760","07:00,760","\"To release.\""]
["07:00,760","07:02,560","\"I think that's exactly what it was trying to teach you.\""]
["07:02,560","07:04,040","\"Okay, okay, okay.\""]
["07:04,040","07:07,120","\"So sometimes swinging is not your best friend.\""]
["07:07,120","07:08,480","\"I guess is the point there.\""]
["07:08,480","07:09,680","\"No, you were doing good.\""]
["07:09,680","07:15,080","\"Listen, man, if I've learned anything about this video game, it's silly.\""]
["07:15,080","07:16,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:16,080","07:20,680","\"What do you think these little mushrooms are they not cute?\""]
["07:20,680","07:22,640","\"I think they're pretty adorable.\""]
["07:22,640","07:24,360","\"Like, adorable.\""]
["07:24,360","07:32,360","\"I would use the Japanese term kawaii dixu in case you didn't know that one.\""]
["07:32,360","07:34,360","\"This is a very frustrating topic.\""]
["07:34,360","07:36,060","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:36,060","07:37,580","\"- Is it not getting any?\""]
["07:37,580","07:39,300","\"- 'Cause I'm not getting any.\""]
["07:39,300","07:41,140","\"- Oh my God.\""]
["07:41,140","07:45,000","\"Okay, you're a little bouncing bean of a boy.\""]

["07:51,820","07:53,540","\"- I tried, you wouldn't do it.\""]
["07:53,540","07:54,380","\"Okay, here we go.\""]
["07:54,380","07:55,380","\"Let's try that again.\""]
["07:55,380","07:58,900","\"Oh my God, that's cool.\""]
["07:58,900","08:00,420","\"- Is that what that was supposed to do?\""]
["08:00,420","08:01,260","\"- Maybe.\""]
["08:01,260","08:07,280","\"That's very like sonic adventure. This is where I'm in a good way. This is where Jim Carrey gets banished\""]

["08:13,620","08:21,100","\"Can I bounce from underneath? Okay now that wouldn't really make sense never in a million years I\""]
["08:21,100","08:28,980","\"Already forget what's this game called again crumble crumble it's a weird name. It is swing. Yeah\""]
["08:28,980","08:33,080","\"Why isn't it called lickitung swing man? Yeah, we're like wet wet ball\""]
["08:33,080","08:41,100","\"Fucking oh my god. Holy shit. You're gonna watch the scenes. Whoa make this a sonic game\""]
["08:41,100","08:45,740","\"So I think it's actually really fair to compare this to sonic and that it does a lot of things that\""]
["08:45,740","08:52,300","\"Sonic could be doing better. It's true. Imagine if I was sonic right now. I feel amazing\""]
["08:52,300","08:56,060","\"Instead you're a ball even better\""]
["08:56,060","09:02,060","\"better yeah you really cut out the middleman by always being a ball yeah\""]
["09:02,060","09:09,020","\"exactly no Sonic what's the worst part of Sonic when he's not a ball when he's\""]
["09:09,020","09:15,180","\"not curled up this is fine as a line whoops oh this is why it's called crumble\""]
["09:15,180","09:19,540","\"see this crap oh because everything crumbles beneath you beneath your might\""]
["09:19,540","09:25,540","\"god this is fun seems like everyone's better at making Sonic then Sega yeah\""]
["09:25,540","09:32,020","\"Exactly. It's like the original creator of Sonic said he said when he's spine is it I'm I say nine\""]
["09:32,020","09:34,020","\"This was during world\""]
["09:34,020","09:38,220","\"Line I say nine picked up a little bit of German, but yeah\""]
["09:38,220","09:44,820","\"That's a little known fact is sonic was actually developed by Nazi scientists\""]
["09:44,820","09:51,220","\"They at the tail end of world war two Nazi scientists basically invented like rocket technology\""]
["09:51,220","09:54,740","\"You know by the radio goddess into space and banana splits\""]
["09:54,740","09:59,660","\"I thought radio predated world war one. Yeah, you're right\""]
["09:59,660","10:13,060","\"That is that does look very fun. It's satisfying to watch\""]
["10:13,060","10:15,540","\"Everything is good when you're going fast\""]
["10:15,540","10:22,940","\"They also did kind of take the design philosophy of like if you put lines on something you'll like see how fast you're going from Sonic\""]
["10:23,260","10:28,540","\"Lines yeah like in green Hill Zone with the lines on the lines like lines on the floor\""]
["10:28,540","10:31,820","\"Yeah, if they were like vertically away from the camera like like there\""]
["10:31,820","10:35,140","\"You can't really see how fast well you can't because of the shadows in the light\""]
["10:35,140","10:40,980","\"But you know what you keep talking. I'll shut up. It's just over. It is your channel. You talk more asshole\""]
["10:40,980","10:43,700","\"Okay, today we're gonna talk about blue\""]
["10:43,700","10:51,620","\"The color blue the blur the blue bomber versus the blue blur who will win did anyone actually call him the blue bomber?\""]
["10:51,620","10:59,800","\"Yeah, I feel like they tried to make that stick because they were jealous of of the blue blur or something\""]
["10:59,800","11:07,900","\"To be fair. I did love both franchises to death back back in the night. I just cannot get into Mega Man\""]
["11:07,900","11:11,420","\"I don't think I never even played a Mega Man game at the time\""]
["11:11,420","11:15,720","\"I just watched the cartoons and I was like I think I like Mega Man do the Mega Man\""]
["11:16,420","11:23,900","\"No, no, no, sorry. It's not shit. It's nothing to me. It's just nothing. Yeah, I I like to Mega Man X\""]
["11:23,900","11:26,500","\"Like after they let you play a zero, but\""]
["11:26,500","11:32,400","\"Which is when people start saying they get bad, so I don't know but I like the way that zero plays\""]
["11:32,400","11:37,400","\"Okay, specifically I think he's like a lot more fun than your standard Mega Man\""]
["11:37,400","11:44,020","\"This is my hot take, but I think Mega Man's a little overrated. Wow. I mean they haven't made a game in like a zillion trillion years\""]
["11:44,820","11:51,380","\"It's kind of sad but it's right. It's like the Edafune or is that the guy's name?\""]
["11:51,380","11:53,540","\"Oh, yeah, well no, we're not starting\""]
["11:53,540","11:59,660","\"And all that yeah, I'm not even trying to go into mighty number nine specifically for better rap\""]

["12:04,100","12:08,420","\"Whatever I played that a few years back on the 3ds, and I thought that was pretty fun\""]
["12:08,420","12:14,220","\"It's sort of remind it was like it was like a sort of new take on a Mega Man X type game\""]
["12:14,220","12:21,520","\"No, I mean Mega Man's like it's got like an okay like design philosophy like adventures of Chris is basically just Mega Man\""]
["12:21,520","12:24,860","\"Say Mega Man is the Dark Souls of the NES I\""]
["12:24,860","12:30,380","\"Hate that it kills me there. So clearly still hanging on. I hate that it kills you on\""]

["46:14,380","46:19,080","\"Like how did this even happen? Do you want to hear a funny story about Jack Black and my dad though really?\""]
["46:19,080","46:22,220","\"Sure, you did on earth history when I was growing up\""]
["46:22,220","46:24,780","\"One of my friends\""]

["46:28,380","46:33,060","\"So he'd play guitar and his brother would play drums and then one time they came over to my house\""]
["46:33,060","46:39,220","\"I like after school and they were like Chris we're thinking about asking Jack Black to come to Wexford and\""]

["46:56,660","46:58,660","\"It was a good place\""]
["47:00,020","47:05,380","\"Sounds like your dad just really doesn't want Jack Black to come to Wexford. No, he's just being realistic. Well, that's interesting\""]
["47:05,380","47:10,980","\"That's what you'd call that that's realistic. They were like 15 year old Irish fucking kids who were shitty guitar and drums\""]
["47:10,980","47:12,980","\"Well, well at the time now they're actually really good\""]
["47:12,980","47:18,380","\"But they're like you're gonna get Jack Black to come hang with us at the gig in Wexford and my dad's laughing at them\""]
["47:18,380","47:24,260","\"My dad would that could be just brutally honest. Yeah, they were just getting hyped. It sounds like\""]
["47:25,540","47:31,320","\"Destroyed their dreams. It's like it's like when I was I remember when I was in first grade and the nicked and the nicked takes over\""]

["50:34,660","50:36,980","\"Feel like yeah in a game like this. It's like\""]
["50:36,980","50:43,500","\"It's definitely like engine driven but then yeah, you do we still have to have the level designs to make it work\""]
["50:43,500","50:47,700","\"His level designs are really simple but like because it's so fun to fuck around with\""]
["50:47,700","50:51,500","\"Kind of just makes itself after a while. Yeah, like\""]
["50:51,500","50:57,420","\"The internal logic of these things is just like they're just wheels. They're just platforms cares\""]

["52:02,980","52:06,580","\"Oh, the final button is at the very top of the column I see\""]
["52:06,580","52:09,620","\"Works for me\""]
["52:09,620","52:20,640","\"Fuck come on there we go. Yes. Whoa. Oh my god. This is getting crazy\""]
["52:20,640","52:26,500","\"Oh little platform pistons if you will\""]
["52:26,500","52:31,380","\"Come on there we go. Yes. Whoa\""]

["53:10,380","53:16,740","\"Fuck no, I cheesed it and then I diseased it there we go. I fought the cheese and the cheese won\""]
["53:16,740","53:21,420","\"Okay, come on. Oh, just get over there\""]
["53:21,420","53:25,740","\"Get the fuck over there\""]

["53:40,740","53:46,580","\"You can't prove it's not true. I can't believe it's not even butter\""]
["53:46,580","53:50,540","\"For a abandoned oh\""]
["53:51,780","54:00,320","\"Now that's a level now that's an abandoned hud of a level this melody like instantly made me think of like final fantasy for some reason really\""]
["54:00,320","54:03,180","\"Yeah, I\""]
["54:03,180","54:06,860","\"Don't know why it like it doesn't anymore, but right when it started\""]
["54:06,860","54:11,720","\"Was it the weird sound font flute maybe I don't know\""]
["54:11,720","54:17,700","\"If a burglar came into your house with a sound font flute you'd be completely disarmed\""]
["54:19,500","54:25,420","\"If a burglar came in like with a final fantasy 7 sound font flute, I would let him steal honestly\""]
["54:25,420","54:31,780","\"Are you like that's so fucking weird you came in with a flute that produces those sounds?\""]
["54:31,780","54:36,660","\"Okay credit where it's dude. Just take something under two grand. We're good. I\""]
["54:36,660","54:40,220","\"Would I would be impressed like how do you even know about that?\""]
["54:40,220","54:43,940","\"I am the sound flute burglar\""]
["54:43,940","54:47,500","\"You'll never expect what I'll do\""]
["54:48,540","54:54,980","\"That's his entire like MO if he like spends weeks painstakingly figuring out what your favorite game is then\""]
["54:54,980","54:59,600","\"Sides the sound font to his dish. You would go and Rob's your gun point\""]
["54:59,600","55:04,620","\"And you can't help just put the find them charming and likable I\""]
["55:04,620","55:13,320","\"Recognize that this level seems much less frustrating than the last one. Yeah, this one was a bit of a gimmick level\""]
["55:13,320","55:15,320","\"But it was a cool gimmick\""]
["55:15,700","55:22,620","\"I'm just moving shit really well. It was just very like vertical and it was cool how the towers just kept ascending higher and higher\""]
["55:22,620","55:29,740","\"This is just a really good example of like if the movement is fun the levels don't need to be too crazy, you know\""]
["55:29,740","55:31,740","\"Like as long as you have fun like\""]
["55:31,740","55:34,100","\"flying around really fast\""]
["55:34,100","55:36,500","\"Feel like you're doing shit\""]
["55:36,500","55:38,340","\"well\""]
["55:38,340","55:44,180","\"Well, you know what would really improve this game though is like jiggle physics on the gym physics for sure\""]
["55:44,180","55:49,760","\"But yeah, I think it would be cool if you found like codex with like paragraphs upon paragraphs of lore\""]
["55:49,760","55:53,180","\"Yeah, that would make this game infinitely more\""]
["55:53,180","55:57,320","\"I would like to listen to like little records you find of like the world lore and like dead people\""]
["55:57,320","56:04,220","\"Yeah, yeah people that have recorded like voice memos for no discernible reason other than to pad the game out with story\""]
["56:04,220","56:06,220","\"Yes, I agree that would be real great\""]
["56:06,220","56:11,920","\"That is so weird that it caught on as a trend of slime world diary\""]
["56:12,540","56:14,620","\"- Entry number 16.\""]
["56:14,620","56:16,980","\"- I feel like it makes sense in like Bioshock one\""]
["56:16,980","56:19,500","\"where you're like, okay, this world is interesting.\""]
["56:19,500","56:20,620","\"I wanna kind of know more.\""]
["56:20,620","56:22,260","\"- Then everything started doing it.\""]
["56:22,260","56:23,100","\"- Yeah.\""]
["56:23,100","56:23,980","\"- And it's always, if you think about\""]
["56:23,980","56:25,700","\"the actual internal logic of it,\""]
["56:25,700","56:27,700","\"it's always like my sister felt ill.\""]
["56:27,700","56:30,180","\"- It feels like it's just to like,\""]
["56:30,180","56:33,180","\"an excuse to hire more writers or something, honestly.\""]
["56:33,180","56:34,260","\"- Maybe, yeah.\""]
["56:34,260","56:38,140","\"Like, I'm playing Cyberpunk right now.\""]
["56:38,140","56:41,260","\"And the amount of reading that I don't do in that game.\""]
["56:41,260","56:44,460","\"- Yeah, I don't think I've read a single like shard I found.\""]
["56:44,460","56:47,340","\"- I know, and I feel bad because somebody clearly wrote it.\""]
["56:47,340","56:50,220","\"- The game has like 200 hours of spoken dialogue,\""]
["56:50,220","56:51,860","\"so why bother reading?\""]
["56:51,860","56:53,820","\"I'll figure it out eventually.\""]
["56:53,820","56:58,240","\"- Yeah, who, I wonder if anybody does read\""]
["56:58,240","57:00,460","\"all those books in like Skyrim and shit.\""]
["57:00,460","57:03,180","\"I can't fault it for being there, but I don't know.\""]
["57:03,180","57:04,220","\"- No, no, I'm just saying yeah,\""]
["57:04,220","57:06,340","\"I'm not gonna be the guy reading it.\""]
["57:06,340","57:07,580","\"I'm not the audience for that.\""]
["57:07,580","57:09,140","\"- I just wonder if all that effort\""]
["57:09,140","57:11,300","\"is like better spent elsewhere.\""]
["57:11,300","57:14,540","\"Although I guess, yeah, you could be right that,\""]
["57:14,540","57:16,660","\"like they might just have writers on staff\""]
["57:16,660","57:17,660","\"that they don't wanna fire.\""]
["57:17,660","57:18,940","\"- I think they just do that stuff\""]
["57:18,940","57:20,260","\"for the pure efficiency of it\""]
["57:20,260","57:23,300","\"because something writers can do almost completely independent\""]
["57:23,300","57:24,780","\"of anyone else on staff,\""]
["57:24,780","57:27,380","\"so they could keep producing content like that,\""]
["57:27,380","57:30,460","\"even when other stuff's kind of on the fence.\""]
["57:30,460","57:34,100","\"- Yeah, point is this game could have maybe used some of that.\""]
["57:34,100","57:36,260","\"The Frisky Aragonian made.\""]
["57:36,260","57:39,100","\"Oh yeah, yeah, that's a classic oblivion book.\""]
["57:39,100","57:47,940","\"The lusty that's it. Wait, is that the lizard race? Yeah. Yeah, she was so lusty. She sure was what it makes\""]
["57:47,940","57:55,220","\"Can I read an excerpt from the lusty? I would be offended if you didn't. Now's the perfect time, honestly. The lusty egg.\""]
["57:55,220","58:04,220","\"Oh, God, it makes me already thinking about it. Yeah, I'm getting pretty up just anticipating the words out of Tomar's mouth.\""]
["58:05,060","58:07,780","\"Do lizards have sphinctores?\""]
["58:07,780","58:08,620","\"I think so.\""]
["58:08,620","58:09,320","\"Good.\""]
["58:09,320","58:12,700","\"Alright, here we go, boys.\""]
