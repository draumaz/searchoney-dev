["04:41,480","04:44,840","\"Wow look at that\""]
["04:45,160","04:50,080","\"It was a little bit interesting of a choice to have a weapon like this on one of those games\""]

["05:42,240","05:43,600","\"Yeah, that'd be good\""]
["05:43,600","05:49,240","\"And you know what it would be better also if you were like a little glove and then you could turn the ball into different types of balls\""]

["06:23,560","06:25,560","\"So I didn't accidentally hit it\""]
["06:25,560","06:29,560","\"There you go come here you\""]
