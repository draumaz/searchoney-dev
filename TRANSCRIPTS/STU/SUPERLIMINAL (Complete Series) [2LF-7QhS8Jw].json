["06:45,420","06:48,100","\"Through that window so I\""]
["06:48,100","06:57,740","\"That took a few tries all environments perceived during eyelids should reflect it this game looks like like I don't really grasp\""]
["06:57,740","07:02,560","\"How you make things bigger and smaller you just have to smush yourself up against the wall really\""]

["07:36,860","07:39,340","\"I'm scared\""]
["07:39,340","07:44,460","\"Yeah, there you go. All right. That's manageable. It'll probably be easier to get over the wall if you get it smaller\""]
["07:44,460","07:50,460","\"Over the wall, okay, so I thought that was maybe you trying to put that over the wall\""]
["07:50,460","07:54,060","\"That's what I thought your objective was was to drop it over to the other side of the wall\""]
["07:54,060","08:00,140","\"Oh, I see and it could be wrong. We haven't even tried going through there. Have we no you're fucking right. You're actually right. Oh\""]

["08:21,380","08:27,080","\"Sometimes the answer is right in front of you. We do have a fucking problem walking through doors\""]
["08:27,080","08:33,100","\"What do you mean? That's just a consistent thing with us. Oh, yeah, you're right. That is a really good point\""]
["08:33,100","08:34,380","\"What do you mean?\""]
["08:34,380","08:39,640","\"We've had this issue before where we all we have to do is walk through the door an exam and I like examine a\""]
["08:39,640","08:43,280","\"Examine we're gonna have to find something. Oh\""]
["08:46,380","08:48,380","\"What how do we get out of here? Oh?\""]

["08:57,860","09:04,140","\"Well, then we'd use shit talk them in front of the Internet. Yeah, and that that is a fate worse than that\""]
["09:04,140","09:09,500","\"Yeah, no no human would subject itself to that willingly. I feel like there's something got to be up here\""]
["09:09,500","09:16,260","\"We got to put on our signature vest and get our stuffed animal companion to speak\""]
["09:16,260","09:20,260","\"- Because we're about to review a shitty game.\""]
