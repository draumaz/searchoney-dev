["02:02,180","02:07,880","\"called Evolution. Oh yeah? Yeah. Oh yeah. The one with like the fucking worm thing in the\""]
["02:07,880","02:12,180","\"ground. Yeah, it was the first DVD I ever owned. Why did he do that? Why didn't he just fucking like\""]

["02:16,680","02:20,760","\"in this area of shooting me you killed his son still be see if I don't even know\""]
["02:20,760","02:28,200","\"hello what the fuck barbecue am I right oh so this is the sky chase I've been\""]

["02:44,320","02:49,920","\"once it's boring forever. Sorry, it was burping, but I was trying to disguise it.\""]
["02:49,920","02:53,200","\"That stupid fucking turtle decided to ride his other turtle.\""]
["02:53,200","02:55,240","\"Yeah, I'm going to end his son's life.\""]
["02:55,240","02:57,840","\"He was just keeping his keep acting like a denier.\""]
["02:57,840","03:01,560","\"And then the regular ass turtle and then fucking plummeted a mile down.\""]
["03:01,560","03:05,960","\"I realize what this is the problem of the stage is there's no checkpoint.\""]
["03:05,960","03:09,400","\"So, of course, I had a fucking run around on a plane for God's sakes.\""]
["03:09,400","03:14,160","\"I know how it's just I accidentally walked on the fucking thing and it made me lose all my rings.\""]
["03:14,160","03:17,160","\"A two year old could run around on a plane, Corey.\""]
["03:17,160","03:19,160","\"Make noise and kick your seat.\""]
["03:19,160","03:20,160","\"Yeah, but can a two year old do this?\""]
["03:20,160","03:22,160","\"Okay, that's pretty cool.\""]
["03:22,160","03:24,160","\"I've got an idea for a Sonic game.\""]
["03:24,160","03:25,160","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["03:25,160","03:29,160","\"Uh, Sonic and Tails are hanging out at the ocean,\""]
["03:29,160","03:31,160","\"or having a kickback, right?\""]
["03:31,160","03:32,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:32,160","03:35,160","\"And then they're wrestling in the sand,\""]
["03:35,160","03:37,160","\"and they're having a good time.\""]
["03:37,160","03:40,160","\"And then Tails accidentally jumps on Sonic,\""]
["03:40,160","03:42,160","\"and Sonic just smashes in a little tiny headshot\""]
["03:42,160","03:48,300","\"I was expecting a more etchy turn. I wasn't expecting him to be violently blown in a little bits of Sonic\""]
["03:48,300","03:53,440","\"But it turns out Sonic was a robot the whole time and he was just controlled by a smaller head shock and even he didn't know\""]
["03:53,440","03:57,440","\"Sorry, I was surprised that what happened there\""]
["03:57,440","04:03,640","\"You like my idea yeah, Sega are you listening Sega you fucking hacks?\""]
["04:03,640","04:08,460","\"How come I could come up with that while I have my fucking finger at my ass yeah, Aaron Weber\""]
["04:08,460","04:10,460","\"*laughing*\""]
["04:10,460","04:11,460","\"What?\""]
["04:11,460","04:12,460","\"*laughing*\""]
["04:12,460","04:13,460","\"What?\""]
["04:13,460","04:14,460","\"That would be low.\""]
["04:14,460","04:15,460","\"I know.\""]
["04:15,460","04:17,460","\"Aaron Weber created Sonic.\""]
["04:17,460","04:18,460","\"Little did you know.\""]
["04:18,460","04:20,460","\"Well he created the Sonic social media.\""]
["04:20,460","04:25,460","\"If he can pull any string for me, it's release the fucking ugly cut of the Sonic movie, please.\""]
["04:25,460","04:26,460","\"Uh, you know what?\""]
["04:26,460","04:28,460","\"What a weird turn of events, right?\""]
["04:28,460","04:29,460","\"Whoo!\""]
["04:29,460","04:30,460","\"Hey!\""]
["04:30,460","04:33,460","\"Don't go on birds last second, there's not enough rings, get it?\""]
["04:33,460","04:34,460","\"Get that ring right now.\""]
["04:34,460","04:41,340","\"That movie comes out very soon and by the time this comes out, maybe it'll be released, but I think I\""]
["04:41,340","04:46,400","\"Think it would be better if it was worse. Do you want to do you want to hear a funny story?\""]
["04:46,400","04:53,300","\"So when the movie was announced and like the remake had been made Dave was losing his fucking mind and just would not budge\""]
["04:53,300","04:59,400","\"He thought that it wasn't just an incomp-en-hand person at the at the lead of the sonic thing\""]
["04:59,500","05:05,100","\"He was thinking it was like this big master plan to sell more copies and I'm like Dave you weren't idiot\""]
["05:05,100","05:08,740","\"This was made by like a fucking studio who has done\""]
["05:08,740","05:14,260","\"Who's doing it now? I'm trying to think I want to say it's universal, but I could be totally wrong\""]
["05:14,260","05:18,480","\"It's like universal. It's like what do they have to gain or lose from a fucking Sonic the Hedgehog movie?\""]
["05:18,480","05:20,480","\"It's already like weird property anyways\""]
["05:20,480","05:23,540","\"and essentially\""]
["05:23,540","05:26,540","\"God dude, sorry\""]
["05:27,860","05:31,780","\"If I get to one life, I'm gonna have to save so basically\""]
["05:31,780","05:34,380","\"Dave was like no, it's conspiracy\""]
["05:34,380","05:37,380","\"It's all set up and he was like getting on Jeff's fucking nerve\""]
["05:37,380","05:42,220","\"So Jeff got pissed and drew a comic and showed Dave and it was basically Dave's like it's conspiracy\""]
["05:42,220","05:44,500","\"Then Jeff's like Dave you're a moron\""]
["05:44,500","05:51,540","\"It was an incompetent person who didn't understand and if you saw the movie it had like gangsters paradise and it looked like dog shit\""]
["05:51,540","05:56,260","\"Yeah, and and then at the very end of it. He showed the rotten tomato score and it was like a 35\""]
["05:57,100","06:00,360","\"I think like it was like the second coming of Christ like it was gonna be a big deal\""]
["06:00,360","06:06,780","\"If there's anything Jeff can do you can make little stick man comics really funny if you ask you'll probably show it to you\""]
["06:06,780","06:10,180","\"There was a hot minute where I thought it might be a conspiracy\""]
["06:10,180","06:14,220","\"So they were like we're remaking Sonic, but then they didn't delay the movie\""]
["06:14,220","06:16,120","\"So at that point for like a week\""]
["06:16,120","06:19,800","\"I was like maybe this is like a marketing thing and then they delayed the movie and I'm like okay\""]
["06:19,800","06:23,540","\"It's probably not yeah exactly I mean the movie look like shit, but they\""]
["06:24,360","06:28,440","\"What the fuck Jesus Christ go go go go go oh my god. Oh you got it. Oh\""]
["06:28,440","06:32,000","\"little dude\""]
["06:32,000","06:36,240","\"This stage is so fucking in\""]
["06:36,240","06:38,240","\"a week\""]
["06:38,240","06:42,880","\"This sucks\""]
["06:42,880","06:51,820","\"Garbage oh my god, I just let me get out of my fucking hell that I created\""]
["06:51,820","07:00,040","\"God damn it it was awesome. Hey, I like how you went from not using it at all to know\""]
["07:01,240","07:02,540","\"It's horrible\""]
["07:02,540","07:09,480","\"This is the worst of the game no one no one is gonna bat an eye that I fucking cheated the system and broke Sega's fucking code\""]
["07:09,480","07:13,880","\"Their code of ethics I forget who made this fucking game\""]
["07:13,880","07:18,040","\"You know the fact that just fires you off the edge like really quickly like that is really mean\""]
["07:18,040","07:23,480","\"I know it's like I should have been holding the direction, but I wasn't paying attention. Jesus Christ. Okay boss fight\""]
["07:23,480","07:25,960","\"Oh\""]
["07:25,960","07:31,080","\"Anyways, is that shit that's this is actually okay? This is a smart one\""]
["07:31,080","07:35,000","\"I'll give him credit for this one. Yeah, is it kind of why?\""]
["07:35,000","07:39,760","\"Cuz it there's no fucking I got a thing with a hammer\""]
["07:39,760","07:44,320","\"This one's hard actually I hate this boss as a kid this took me forever to figure out\""]
