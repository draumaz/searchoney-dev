["10:19,920","10:23,420","\"- They know karate, open a karate dojo\""]
["10:23,420","10:25,960","\"and tell everyone that we're a black belt,\""]

["10:32,600","10:33,440","\"- Yeah, we should--\""]
["10:33,440","10:36,040","\"- Sounds like what a lot of people actually do for a career.\""]
["10:36,040","10:39,120","\"- We should also take real karate courses on the side\""]
["10:39,120","10:41,000","\"so that we know a little bit of real karate,\""]
["10:41,000","10:42,960","\"but only enough to beat up the people\""]
["10:42,960","10:45,040","\"that we're showing the fake karate to.\""]
["10:45,040","10:47,240","\"- It could be like Kung Fu master black belt dolphin.\""]
