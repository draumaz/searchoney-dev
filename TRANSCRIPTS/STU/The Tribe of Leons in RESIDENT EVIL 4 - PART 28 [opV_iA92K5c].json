["18:52,960","18:56,000","\"And why was it that Nintendo chose them?\""]
["18:56,000","18:57,520","\"They worked on like one film.\""]
["18:57,520","18:59,000","\"They kept hopping between people\""]

["19:00,400","19:01,240","\"So they trusted them.\""]
["19:01,240","19:02,960","\"But then they didn't really know what they're doing.\""]
["19:02,960","19:05,040","\"There were a few iterations of the script\""]

["19:07,240","19:09,600","\"And by the end of it, it was just nothing's working.\""]
["19:09,600","19:12,560","\"They keep coming up with stuff on the spot.\""]

["19:17,520","19:19,320","\"So it just became a mess,\""]
["19:19,320","19:21,040","\"and everyone just kind of went with it by the end\""]

["22:13,940","22:18,580","\"They'll like it because it wasn't as bad as it could have been and that'll be the angle probably like Sonic\""]
