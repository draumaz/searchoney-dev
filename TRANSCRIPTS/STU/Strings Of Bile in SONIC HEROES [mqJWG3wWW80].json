["00:50,160","00:55,000","\"I think that is true. Yeah, but that's when video games and stuff were new so there was not really a precedent\""]

["01:43,940","01:51,780","\"It's just like non-existent like something can maybe be popular like if you can never really gauge how long something will stay popular\""]
