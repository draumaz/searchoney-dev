["11:39,100","11:41,820","\"This is my favorite world that we go to.\""]
["11:41,820","11:51,820","\"very first one. I mean you might as well have a good ass first level right? Yeah they put a lot of work into it. Look at that look at that\""]
["11:51,820","12:05,900","\"it's like Cooper in tide of terror. I'm a legend. He's ready to see what Adam's capable of. Alright this is the extent of your power. I just feel bad for the viewer\""]
["12:05,900","12:09,200","\"The watch this compression. It's so don't feel bad for them\""]
["12:09,200","12:13,960","\"You're gonna compress it on top of that and you know what they're probably gonna be like this looks fine\""]
["12:13,960","12:16,180","\"What do you mean Chris? You're absolutely right?\""]
["12:16,180","12:21,740","\"Can I can I give an explanation for something? Yeah? Yeah explain yourself look guys\""]
["12:21,740","12:26,140","\"I know there's compilations we have uploaded that are so unbelievably badly compressed\""]
["12:26,140","12:29,880","\"We may as well have just shot ourselves in the face, but the reason that happens is\""]
["12:29,880","12:35,740","\"Our compilation guys will download a compressed video because they can only get that version and then once they\""]
["12:35,740","12:39,360","\"They render it out. It's even more compressed, so we just can't help it, okay\""]
["12:39,360","12:42,060","\"So what does compression do?\""]
["12:42,060","12:46,180","\"Like squeezes it into a tiny sphere in the digital realm. That's pretty cool\""]
["12:46,180","12:48,260","\"So it can fit into digital safes. Oh\""]
["12:48,260","12:55,320","\"Digital guards can guard it with guns. I wish I could do this digital guns the digitizers and minor digitize attackers\""]
["12:55,320","12:59,000","\"How does how does one go about compressing one of these?\""]
["12:59,900","13:01,900","\"You use the digital\""]
["13:01,900","13:03,500","\"Demonstrator\""]
["13:03,500","13:06,760","\"Okay, I don't really care. I kind of want to see the matrix now\""]
["13:06,760","13:11,960","\"Or whatever they shoot bullets. They just shoot ones and zeros. That'd be good. But that'd be a funny gag\""]
["13:11,960","13:17,640","\"I feel like that would be actually never get old actually for the whole movie. I'm gonna blow\""]
["13:17,640","13:19,460","\"What?\""]
["13:19,460","13:25,120","\"You could do like if you did like an animated thing like a spider-verse looking ass thing you could get away with that\""]
["13:25,120","13:28,540","\"I think that would be a cool cool concept for a thing. Yeah\""]
["13:28,540","13:34,960","\"See now that we've said it you can sue anybody that uses that idea or comes up with it on their own\""]
["13:34,960","13:42,260","\"Yeah, yeah speaking of spider verse. Yeah, see new person boots stole their stuff. Yeah, and it's just good\""]
["13:42,260","13:46,980","\"So I don't really care, but yeah, oh you let plagiarism happen\""]
["13:46,980","13:51,180","\"I'm plagiaring\""]
["13:51,180","13:57,260","\"No, no that felt real today was real. It's not like real at all\""]
["13:57,260","13:59,260","\"Did you not like it?\""]
["13:59,260","14:00,540","\"Are you fucking brainy?\""]
["14:00,540","14:05,740","\"I thought it was an extremely pretty yet annoying movie.\""]

["14:06,740","14:07,740","\"Guys, guys.\""]

["14:11,300","14:16,780","\"I saw it like a couple people being like, \"\"This is okay.\"\"\""]

["14:33,000","14:35,000","\"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit\""]
["14:35,000","14:39,760","\"That movie annoys the shit out of me because these movies like do this thing where they're like oh no\""]
["14:39,760","14:44,540","\"They like they show all the locations from the beginning and they're like we gotta go there\""]
