["00:12,200","00:15,440","\"Alright, so in 1996, Mario was born.\""]
["00:15,440","00:18,880","\"A man of many talents, a man of many hairs.\""]
["00:18,880","00:20,640","\"Uh, okay.\""]
["00:20,640","00:24,680","\"In 2002, Mario's wife died.\""]
["00:24,680","00:29,880","\"And in Mario 2007, Mario celebrates the year 2007.\""]
["00:29,880","00:30,920","\"And what a year it was.\""]
["00:30,920","00:32,520","\"And then there were a bunch of soundtracks.\""]
["00:32,520","00:34,160","\"Mario dropped his mixtape.\""]
["00:34,160","00:35,280","\"There's 81 tracks.\""]
["00:35,280","00:35,920","\"I can't listen.\""]
["00:35,920","00:38,920","\"I was like, what's a walla walla walla?\""]
["00:38,920","00:42,520","\"It's perfectly titled.\""]
["00:42,520","00:45,080","\"Someone got paid to do that garbage.\""]
["00:45,080","00:46,000","\"What a moron.\""]
["00:46,000","00:49,560","\"If someone offered me money to do that, I would turn it down.\""]
["00:49,560","00:51,080","\"OK, we're going to play this game.\""]
["00:51,080","00:54,360","\"Yeah, OK, let's not play this.\""]
["00:54,360","00:59,160","\"That's what it feels like when you take a little jagged shit.\""]
["00:59,160","01:01,860","\"-Like your little stinger. -Like your piece stinger.\""]
["01:01,860","01:05,240","\"-That's like a perfect cone. -Oh, gosh.\""]
["01:05,240","01:07,500","\"-Wait. I just noticed.\""]
["01:07,500","01:11,200","\"-It's not 2007. -Well, there's that, but also...\""]
["01:11,200","01:12,400","\"-We're in space.\""]
["01:12,400","01:15,040","\"-Good tri-ediot. Space is fake.\""]
["01:15,040","01:18,140","\"That was exactly what I wanted you to say.\""]
["01:18,140","01:19,640","\"I keep telling you.\""]
["01:19,640","01:21,240","\"We're gonna space pill people today.\""]
["01:21,240","01:25,180","\"-Yeah, we know Lyell's been properly space-pelled at this point.\""]
["01:25,180","01:29,100","\"Whoa, it made it her head.\""]
["01:29,100","01:31,420","\"She's what is going on?\""]
["01:31,420","01:37,460","\"Imagine if Mario got to the moon first and did this to it and then those astronauts\""]
["01:37,460","01:41,140","\"that faked the moonland and got up there and tried to put their fake little flag in there\""]
["01:41,140","01:42,580","\"and it was just Peach's head.\""]
["01:42,580","01:43,940","\"I'd be down with that.\""]
["01:43,940","01:46,020","\"I always had a crush on Peach.\""]
["01:46,020","01:49,540","\"I don't know if I did to her if that was just conditioning.\""]
["01:49,540","01:51,740","\"No, she's just so perfect.\""]
["01:51,740","01:57,740","\"I never really pined for peach. Yeah, you were a Sega kid. Is this the browning of\""]
["01:57,740","02:05,740","\"cells? The celiacorn on the other hand. Whoa, we the toads. They're harvesting the stars.\""]
["02:05,740","02:11,660","\"I knew there was something. You can't commodify that. It belongs to everyone.\""]
["02:11,660","02:18,140","\"Read that. It should have been a very happy to fuck. It was the night of the star festival.\""]
["02:19,260","02:22,380","\"You know you can buy a star and name it after a dude.\""]
["02:22,380","02:23,140","\"Really?\""]
["02:23,140","02:23,800","\"Yes!\""]
["02:23,800","02:24,980","\"Can you name it anything?\""]
["02:24,980","02:26,140","\"You can name it anything!\""]
["02:26,140","02:27,580","\"Yeah, there's so many stars.\""]
["02:27,580","02:29,100","\"Aliens have to honor it.\""]
["02:29,100","02:31,940","\"So this is the hero, huh?\""]
["02:31,940","02:32,680","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:32,680","02:35,180","\"I hate Mario.\""]
["02:35,180","02:37,820","\"He's kind of an asshole, and he's my dad.\""]
["02:37,820","02:40,060","\"The Mario's your dad?\""]
["02:40,060","02:41,020","\"The Mario...\""]
["02:41,020","02:42,620","\"is my dad.\""]
["02:42,620","02:45,020","\"Well, were you the first person to say the Mario?\""]
["02:45,020","02:46,300","\"I don't know.\""]
["02:46,300","02:47,140","\"The Mario?\""]
["02:47,140","02:49,860","\"I called him the Mario for a while now.\""]
["02:49,860","02:52,300","\"'Cause I've started seeing that more regularly now.\""]
["02:52,300","02:53,140","\"The Mario?\""]
["02:53,140","02:55,060","\"I've never seen the Mario.\""]
["02:55,060","02:57,020","\"Yeah, I think Lyle started it.\""]
["02:57,020","02:57,860","\"I might have.\""]
["02:57,860","03:02,620","\"Oh yeah, yeah, you can just grab those right out the sky.\""]
["03:02,620","03:04,820","\"Apparently you can give someone else\""]
["03:04,820","03:07,620","\"the second controller to be the stupid wiggly star thing.\""]
["03:07,620","03:10,820","\"Yeah, and it totally, it causes more problems than it solves.\""]
["03:10,820","03:11,660","\"Does it really?\""]
["03:11,660","03:12,660","\"Oh yeah, okay.\""]
["03:12,660","03:14,980","\"'Cause the second player can make you like double jump\""]
["03:14,980","03:16,900","\"and then fire all your coins away.\""]
["03:16,900","03:18,060","\"(laughing)\""]
["03:18,060","03:19,460","\"Oh, this is a video.\""]
["03:19,460","03:20,980","\"Rip straight from the Wii.\""]
["03:20,980","03:22,420","\"Rip straight from the heart.\""]
["03:22,420","03:27,580","\"- I did like this call back to Mario 3\""]
["03:27,580","03:29,140","\"with the airships and all.\""]
["03:29,140","03:30,580","\"- Oh yeah, I always loved that song.\""]
["03:30,580","03:32,420","\"The boy, boy, boy.\""]

["03:36,060","03:38,380","\"War March theme.\""]
["03:38,380","03:40,300","\"- It is like the Imperial March.\""]
["03:40,300","03:42,300","\"(humming)\""]
["03:43,900","03:46,900","\"All this music is an actual orchestra, right?\""]
["03:46,900","03:48,380","\"- I mean, on this one?\""]
["03:48,380","03:49,820","\"It's a trick, but yeah.\""]
["03:49,820","03:51,260","\"- Yeah, obviously it was a scheme.\""]
["03:51,260","03:54,660","\"Everybody involved thought that they were composing\""]
["03:54,660","03:55,740","\"for the war.\""]
["03:55,740","03:56,820","\"So this is a real motor.\""]
["03:56,820","03:57,660","\"- So this is real motor.\""]
["03:57,660","03:59,420","\"- Holding these blades of grass, he's blowing into them.\""]
["03:59,420","04:01,820","\"You just lower the pitch, add some reverb, voila.\""]
["04:01,820","04:02,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:02,660","04:05,460","\"- This was just me a motor tending to his garden\""]
["04:05,460","04:08,580","\"and finding some extra time to record the soundtrack.\""]
["04:08,580","04:09,700","\"- He thought he was alone,\""]
["04:09,700","04:11,380","\"and then a wata popped out of the bushes,\""]
["04:11,380","04:12,540","\"God rest his soul and said,\""]
["04:12,540","04:14,540","\"I got the doll right away.\""]

["04:16,800","04:20,420","\"Whoa, whoa, whoa.\""]
["04:20,420","04:24,680","\"I'd kill Peach too, honestly.\""]
["04:24,680","04:26,880","\"'Cause you can't have her.\""]
["04:26,880","04:28,880","\"Is he doing that to kill her?\""]
["04:28,880","04:29,720","\"I hope.\""]
["04:29,720","04:32,320","\"How did Bowser get a fucking spirit bomb?\""]
["04:32,320","04:34,640","\"Look, she keeps children in her castle\""]
["04:34,640","04:36,440","\"and fucking ghosts in her eye.\""]
["04:36,440","04:38,800","\"Okay.\""]
["04:38,800","04:41,000","\"She is an elite of the Mushroom Kingdom.\""]

["05:02,760","05:10,360","\"I uh so I never like played through this played through this because uh this is my first time ever\""]
["05:10,360","05:16,000","\"I played it once at a friend's house, but at the time it came out. I was just so tired of the we just\""]
["05:16,000","05:19,120","\"Cuz that controller sucks. Yeah\""]
["05:19,120","05:23,660","\"Is that a controversial opinion in this day and age that that controller kind of didn't work?\""]
["05:23,660","05:28,680","\"Uh, I don't know. I remember when the Wii motion plus came out everyone stopped saying that. Oh, yeah\""]
["05:28,680","05:34,680","\"Well, this was before that wasn't it? I never liked holding that stupid square also the Wii motion plus anybody who had played\""]
["05:34,680","05:40,280","\"Skyward sword can attest that that thing didn't really work either. Yeah, but uh, I just remember it\""]
["05:40,280","05:45,920","\"this point like I was boycotting is maybe too strong of a word but just tired of\""]
["05:45,920","05:51,320","\"playing the Wii so if a game came out for it and I didn't like absolutely need\""]
["05:51,320","05:56,880","\"it I was just like fuck it yeah I remember I was so fucking disappointed when I\""]
["05:56,880","06:02,160","\"played the Zelda on the Wii was a Twilight Princess yeah it basically\""]
["06:02,160","06:06,440","\"just replaced the B button with any discernible movement of your arm hated\""]
["06:06,440","06:09,180","\"It's a lot of games that did that.\""]
["06:09,180","06:11,620","\"Were the Wii motion thing?\""]
["06:11,620","06:15,100","\"It was literally just that instead of a button.\""]
["06:15,100","06:17,860","\"So he just steals the whole thing this time, huh?\""]
["06:17,860","06:20,420","\"If he's got the resources, I mean, why not?\""]
["06:20,420","06:25,020","\"I'd assume even if he did have the resources, it would always take less resources just to\""]
["06:25,020","06:27,220","\"grab the person out.\""]
["06:27,220","06:28,220","\"But this is cooler.\""]
["06:28,220","06:29,220","\"Right.\""]
["06:29,220","06:30,220","\"And he's got aliens helping.\""]
["06:30,220","06:34,100","\"If you were like one of those billionaires, you had unlimited money and aliens.\""]
["06:34,100","06:38,100","\"If you want to fuck with somebody, you might as well do it in the stupidest way possible.\""]
["06:38,100","06:42,220","\"Start building pyramids on their property.\""]
["06:42,220","06:44,620","\"How would you fuck with someone if you had unlimited money?\""]
["06:44,620","06:50,460","\"If you could buy all the houses around them, unbeknownst to them, and hire actors as their\""]
["06:50,460","06:52,740","\"neighbors, that would be so fucking cool.\""]
["06:52,740","06:55,020","\"You could get away with so much horrible shit.\""]
["06:55,020","06:58,340","\"That's technically not illegal, I don't think.\""]
["06:58,340","07:02,700","\"I think it would be cool if you could make a ring of statues of the person, of them all\""]
["07:02,700","07:05,020","\"fucking themselves in the ass so he can't escape.\""]
["07:05,020","07:07,740","\"He has to look at a ring of himself, fucking himself in the ass.\""]
["07:07,740","07:13,860","\"What if you got actors to move in around them and paid the actors to get plastic surgery\""]
["07:13,860","07:18,980","\"to look exactly like them and just slowly move them in over the course of like a year\""]
["07:18,980","07:19,980","\"or two?\""]
["07:19,980","07:25,780","\"I would be frightened, like imagine that shit, that would be horrifying.\""]
["07:25,780","07:29,660","\"And they're all like, they all say that they have your job and do the same shit you do.\""]
["07:29,660","07:31,700","\"And they all have the same wife.\""]
["07:31,700","07:36,200","\"Oh, my name's Chris too. That's so weird. I'm also a youtuber. That's so sick\""]
["07:36,200","07:41,560","\"And then they like pay for bots to have the same amount of subscribers. I hate this fucking rabbit\""]
["07:41,560","07:45,800","\"Well, he's your responsibility. This is your last chance to demolish him\""]
["07:45,800","07:49,780","\"Hey, this is your last chance to throw him into the vacuum of space\""]
["07:49,780","07:59,420","\"Me a motor used to chase a rabbit around his house and grab it. Yeah, he said that he got the idea for Mario after smashing a rabbit\""]
["07:59,420","08:06,620","\"He said he's nothing more fun than slapping the rabbit to you said he put nails in each of its ears and\""]
["08:06,620","08:14,760","\"Crucified it on a little on a little baseboard this that this really was the big gimmick of this game was just the the wrapping levels, right?\""]
["08:14,760","08:20,340","\"Yes, I just feel like I'm gonna be sick sometimes just looking at it well\""]
["08:20,340","08:22,880","\"I see your point, but also it's kind of stupid\""]
["08:22,880","08:25,540","\"Yeah, you're not actually a game designer\""]
["08:26,540","08:32,300","\"You can't have an opinion on something unless you are the job of which you want to have the opinion of also if you think you can\""]
["08:32,300","08:36,760","\"Make a better game the Mario just all by yourself. Why don't you why haven't you done it? Yeah?\""]
["08:36,760","08:41,840","\"I'm just talking about Mario Galaxy. Oh, so if it's just Mario Galaxy, you could make a better game\""]
["08:41,840","08:49,960","\"You could make a better game. I'm saying yeah, you're saying something and I'm still trying to parse what did you own that guy now?\""]
["08:49,960","08:55,620","\"Does he have to do everything you say? Uh-huh. He's my star child. So y'all. Oh, yeah, I basically\""]
["08:56,260","09:02,360","\"Have full custody and I get child support for him. Oh crop circles crop stars what?\""]
["09:02,360","09:06,500","\"Yeah, there's like stars shaped like yeah\""]
["09:06,500","09:14,100","\"His stars did aliens carve little star men into the planet because they were being dicks that that rabbit had a beacon on his skull\""]
["09:14,100","09:18,260","\"Come here you how do I oh yeah, I'll just run into them. I thought there was a grab button\""]
["09:18,260","09:24,100","\"Should have hidden the grass is that like it like a tip I\""]
["09:24,660","09:31,500","\"Think that guy's just lamenting his poor choices in life. That's that yeah, there it is. He's out. He's out\""]
["09:31,500","09:36,100","\"He's out. He's about fucking kill him come here stupid. I think you can lunge at him too\""]
["09:36,100","09:39,260","\"I thought so all the controls are confusing\""]
["09:39,260","09:44,300","\"There's still like a Z jump like in Mario 64 Mario can lunge at him bearing his teeth\""]
["09:44,300","09:46,940","\"For if you crouch right before you jump or something\""]
["09:46,940","09:52,500","\"Yeah, you know if you flip a rabbit on its back too fast it can have a heart attack and die. Is that real?\""]
["09:52,500","09:57,840","\"Yeah, I've never heard that so Mario is actually putting these things at risk by grabbing them like that\""]
["09:57,840","10:02,420","\"There's definitely certain creatures we live with in the modern day that like they should be dead\""]
["10:02,420","10:08,740","\"They should be extinct rabbits aren't extinct just because they multiply so much same thing with rats and shit\""]
["10:08,740","10:13,920","\"Yeah, they're they're rate of breeding mix up for all their other evolutionary shortcomings\""]
["10:22,100","10:27,880","\"Star leaner star leans a good name why didn't they call her star lean star away? Yeah\""]
["10:27,880","10:30,620","\"How'd it been okay?\""]
["10:30,620","10:36,260","\"Did he just swallow that Mario looks fucking fat in this game I?\""]
["10:36,260","10:39,420","\"Feed you my children\""]
["10:39,420","10:41,860","\"Goodbye. I\""]
["10:41,860","10:48,420","\"Like the way everything in this game has like the outer lines. I mean the outer brightness rim lighting looks cool\""]
["10:48,420","10:51,820","\"It helps you pop out from the starry sky\""]
["10:51,820","10:59,860","\"Oh, yeah, do you think that's a real lighting effect or you know it's definitely a shader cheat because it\""]
["10:59,860","11:06,860","\"It's unlike everything but a lot of shader cheats look really good. See I don't have a joy con so I'm getting confused\""]
["11:06,860","11:12,260","\"See you control or we can also press why I think I hate having to do this shit. Why?\""]
["11:12,260","11:19,340","\"Okay, yeah, yeah, okay good. That's actually very good. I freaky hate moving\""]
["11:19,900","11:21,900","\"I hate activity.\""]
