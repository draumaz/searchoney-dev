["00:24,400","00:29,400","\"You guys have to try harder, you're just always standing there.\""]
["00:29,400","00:34,300","\"It's funny to me whenever you get a headshot and they cover their eye. It's like they get just like mildly poked\""]
["00:34,300","00:40,820","\"Yeah, there's something weird about these guys. I kept my finger on it. They don't act like regular people\""]

["00:47,180","00:52,800","\"Yeah, they're they're informing us that shit's getting serious. I heard the music sting. They're spooky music\""]
["00:52,800","00:54,800","\"So I came out of green and\""]

["01:13,520","01:17,140","\"Why did we hire you\""]
["01:17,140","01:23,920","\"Cuz he's hip he's down with it. He's got a nice haircut and he's buff and pretty he says word up Ashley\""]
["01:23,920","01:25,920","\"-I'm so hungry. -I'm so hungry.\""]
["01:25,920","01:28,920","\"-You just get away from me. -I'm cool.\""]
["01:28,920","01:33,920","\"-Should this game end with Leon says, and he tells you not to get him the dishwasher?\""]
["01:33,920","01:37,920","\"-I freaking love that idea. -The washing machine. Not the dishwasher.\""]
["01:37,920","01:41,920","\"-But it's different. That's Sonic. -That's true. Sonic's already done it.\""]
["01:41,920","01:44,920","\"-Who go there? -Which do you think is more painful?\""]
["01:44,920","01:49,920","\"-I don't think people could necessarily fit themselves into a dishwasher.\""]
["01:49,920","01:52,920","\"-That's chilled. -Chilled. -Chilled.\""]
["01:52,920","01:57,420","\"There's barely any room then how could a person fit into a washing machine?\""]
["01:57,420","02:00,420","\"Oh because there's plenty of room at the big opening it's a big hole\""]
["02:00,420","02:04,920","\"It's true, and it kind of looks like a sonic loop, which is probably why Sonic had to talk about it\""]
["02:04,920","02:10,820","\"Kids were trying to run in it. Yeah, they were trying to run in circles inside of it and Sonic had to tell them it doesn't work\""]
["02:10,820","02:14,720","\"If you think it's smart to climb in a dryer, you're really all wet\""]
["02:14,720","02:17,620","\"Okay, is that in my pocket?\""]
["02:17,620","02:19,620","\"I have something in my front pocket for you\""]
["02:20,520","02:23,240","\"Why don't you reach on and grab it and say what it is?\""]
["02:23,240","02:24,960","\"I\""]
["02:24,960","02:30,640","\"Remember that was the the you got served episode. Yeah, that was butters. I love that episode old tap dance\""]
["02:30,640","02:34,920","\"I remember that was one the last seasons where it still felt like the show is pretty on point\""]
["02:34,920","02:41,080","\"I remember watching that episode when it was new and being really into it. They censored it later. I remember the initial premiere\""]
["02:41,080","02:48,400","\"There were slight differences in terms of like audio. Oh, I think his hat said something different on it too\""]
["02:48,400","02:52,280","\"I was gonna guess like you meant like oh we lost the copyright to the music\""]
["02:52,280","02:56,500","\"No, they just like altered it later. They're all parody anyway. They're all like\""]
["02:56,500","03:02,820","\"It's weird how that kind of thinking happened didn't like a Rick and Morty episode premiere and the colors were all wrong really\""]
["03:02,820","03:04,820","\"I don't know I wouldn't have known\""]
["03:04,820","03:11,220","\"Sometimes it just happens it's some kind of research equipment. I wonder what it's useful the wrong production cut ends up out there\""]
["03:11,220","03:13,380","\"It's probably for research. I would guess\""]
["03:13,380","03:15,580","\"Ashley\""]
["03:15,580","03:17,580","\"What have they done?\""]
["03:17,580","03:21,580","\"That's me. That's me from a minute ago. What's going on?\""]
["03:21,580","03:25,080","\"He's losing his mind.\""]
["03:25,080","03:28,580","\"Is everybody me? He's so sleep deprived.\""]
["03:28,580","03:30,580","\"He probably has a...\""]
["03:30,580","03:32,580","\"How long has he been on this island?\""]
["03:32,580","03:35,580","\"It seems like days. I don't know, but we've only been playing a few hours.\""]
["03:35,580","03:40,580","\"Uh... I don't know. Has this all happened over the course of a single night?\""]
["03:40,580","03:43,580","\"Oh, of course. This looks fun.\""]
["03:43,580","03:45,580","\"I've never seen this OS before.\""]
["03:45,580","04:15,140","\"for. Look, I'm good. See? Oh, it's a pipe challenge. We like flashing colors. Oh, you did it. The data is flowing through the correct pipes. We all smart. The hideous creatures, no, and has the edge again. And then those three stadors are merely by products of the diabolical and inhumane experiments conducted on the specimens that were once human.\""]
["04:15,140","04:20,320","\"But there's one type of creature that clearly this doing issues itself from the rest. I thought it said refrigerators\""]
["04:20,320","04:22,720","\"These creatures are called regenerators\""]
["04:22,720","04:27,440","\"Regenerators have a superior metabolism that allows them to regenerate their lost body parts of the credible speed\""]
["04:27,440","04:33,400","\"I've never seen anything like it. It is this characteristic that makes them almost invincible\""]
["04:33,400","04:38,920","\"But like any living creature. There's a way to kill it. Apparently there are plague eyes that live in its body\""]
["04:39,400","04:44,520","\"Somewhat like leeches. They can't be seen with the naked eye. They can only be located through thermal imaging\""]
["04:44,520","04:48,440","\"Well, you know what to do get ready for this new enemy type whoever's reading this nose\""]
["04:48,440","04:52,280","\"Oh, baby\""]
["04:52,280","04:59,200","\"I love this that's so fucking smart. Yeah, they made a little museum exhibit just for you body works\""]
["04:59,200","05:03,320","\"What was it called were they they ripped apart all the human bodies and made them an art?\""]
["05:03,320","05:06,840","\"That's body works. Okay, I was trying to remember where they're like preserved and you can see their\""]
["05:07,320","05:13,040","\"School tissues and such and they make them do embarrassing things. There's one stickiness finger up somebody's butt\""]
["05:13,040","05:15,760","\"How would you feel if that was your fate?\""]
["05:15,760","05:22,040","\"Would you donate yourself to science at least I'm ripped apart enough that nobody knows who I am anymore these guys are spooky\""]
["05:22,040","05:26,640","\"Yes, they are they tried to make them real creepy. I like the\""]
["05:26,640","05:33,760","\"The panting is good the pale skin the long arms. It makes it feel really inhuman. I love their music\""]
["05:35,160","05:41,440","\"That's uh, that's the way to design. Oh the face is lame to me, but still it's it's still pretty creepy\""]
["05:41,440","05:45,160","\"Actually, I like the face the the face is pretty good\""]
["05:45,160","05:50,880","\"The sharp teeth I was expecting it to have like like really small facial features or something I\""]
["05:50,880","05:56,000","\"Think when you see what the sharp teeth do it's pretty cool. Let me guess he opens his mouth too wide\""]
["05:56,000","06:00,240","\"Yeah, but it's freaky because like he can bite you in there sharp and stuff\""]
["06:01,560","06:05,000","\"That makes enough sense. They're supposed to be there's supposed to be weapons\""]
["06:05,000","06:12,920","\"But for me, I think because it gives it such a specific facial expression the way he walks is also kind of goofy\""]
["06:12,920","06:18,720","\"For me a big a big thing that makes a character design creepy\""]
["06:18,720","06:27,720","\"You want to avoid Jesus fuck you want to avoid Jesus you you want to avoid a\""]
["06:28,960","06:35,140","\"Certainable like emotional expression. I think that's a big thing that creeps people out as you want to feel like\""]
["06:35,140","06:40,220","\"I don't know what this thing intends to do. He's got the face of like the robot from babies kids or something\""]
["06:40,220","06:42,540","\"He's got an evil grin with red eyes\""]
["06:42,540","06:46,720","\"Just wasting ammo. I thought that if I\""]
["06:46,720","06:54,560","\"That's the worst thing that I could have done. That's pretty good. I told you they're the fucking coolest things ever\""]
["06:55,560","07:01,360","\"But in general I think I'll relate it to that a good way to make a character design that creeps me out is like\""]
["07:01,360","07:07,320","\"Something that looks like recognizably human, but it's enough off that you can be like this is not right. I\""]
["07:07,320","07:13,460","\"Want more of that this guy probably creatures that just are unexpected. You don't know what they're going to do\""]
["07:13,460","07:17,840","\"This guy probably doesn't want to do my friend. Do something like that that they flop at you. Oh\""]
["07:17,840","07:20,720","\"My god, what happened?\""]
["07:20,720","07:23,800","\"How intelligent do you think they are\""]
["07:24,720","07:26,720","\"I've been wondering that about all of these\""]
["07:26,720","07:30,720","\"Like the villagers you can kind of assume like okay\""]
["07:30,720","07:35,280","\"They're just like being subtly influenced to be more aggressive. You can take that sort of like\""]
["07:35,280","07:41,360","\"28 days later like okay, it's the it's an anger virus. It makes you really really aggressive\""]
["07:41,360","07:49,280","\"Yeah, but this game it's all about the parasite as we go on you should stop and quiz them to figure out how intelligent each one is\""]
["07:49,280","07:53,720","\"I'm sort of questioning like okay like to what extent are the creatures controlling the people?\""]
["07:53,720","07:58,720","\"Oh, God. Oh, no, you would assume that, uh,\""]
["07:58,720","08:03,680","\"poor spiders, he would assume that in order to carry out all these orders that to like\""]
["08:03,680","08:10,480","\"the guy, um, what is his name? Lorenzo. The little little man he gets in the Salazar. He\""]
["08:10,480","08:13,720","\"gets in the elevator with one and I'm like, you'd think that he'd be like ripping him\""]
["08:13,720","08:18,360","\"to shreds. How does he? How are they smart enough to be commanded? It's got like a creepy\""]
["08:18,360","08:19,360","\"bug face.\""]
["08:19,360","08:22,660","\"Because he's not fresh. She's not like Leon\""]
["08:22,660","08:27,360","\"Let's do the one thing that will ruin his scariness and zoom right in on it\""]
["08:27,360","08:34,860","\"I think that looks cool. He's got like a goomba head for Mario. Yeah, I like that\""]
["08:34,860","08:39,440","\"Scary in the Mario\""]
["08:39,440","08:46,320","\"Kids I don't think it's so much how they look. It's probably the transformation. No, I think the idea of that. Yeah\""]
["08:47,240","08:52,780","\"People were freaked out by that. We're getting turned into a monkey. You know that scared the shit out of me\""]
["08:52,780","08:58,820","\"Would you be upset to be turned into a like did uh did the kids getting turned into monkeys in?\""]
["08:58,820","09:04,480","\"We're back scare you Chris a little bit. I was more scared of jumanji because he looks so horrifying\""]
["09:04,480","09:12,080","\"Oh, no doors been locked. I know no wonder is a thing going to all I\""]
["09:12,080","09:15,620","\"Love how they get up\""]
["09:15,740","09:21,900","\"Yeah, they are they're still designed really cool. I have a gripe with the face, but that's literally the worst thing about them\""]
["09:21,900","09:24,780","\"And it's I know where you're coming from maybe it's just nostalgia goggles\""]
["09:24,780","09:29,180","\"It's not that big of a deal. It's just a thing that throws it off a bit\""]
["09:29,180","09:34,060","\"I guess just because it's a goofy face my thing is if you have an evil character who has a very deliberately\""]
["09:34,060","09:42,300","\"I'm evil. Yeah, it throws me out of it. That's exactly Pennywise. Yeah, the new penny wise evil clowns gave him like a\""]
["09:43,660","09:47,700","\"Weevil under wood face that he's always making an evil grin and it's like okay\""]
["09:47,700","09:53,780","\"I get it evil clowns piss me off because a big a big creepy smile. It's like yeah, I know I get it your evil I\""]
["09:53,780","09:59,500","\"Think it's I think a clown killing you is scarier if it's just a normal person face\""]
["09:59,500","10:02,220","\"I don't know\""]
["10:02,220","10:09,980","\"He should start running up to you. Yeah, the legs should start running after you like faster. I honestly love the new it\""]
["10:09,980","10:13,260","\"I still haven't seen it. I'm a huge fan of it\""]
["10:13,260","10:18,980","\"Well, I like the first one. I think the cycle one sucks eggs. I think everybody feels that way. That's the only thing I've heard\""]
["10:18,980","10:24,220","\"It's really sad because the first one I really freaking like it felt like an old 90s movie with like how it was paced\""]
["10:24,220","10:29,300","\"I mean, I remember people saying the same thing about the original mini series that the idea of like okay once they're adults\""]
["10:29,300","10:31,300","\"You can stop watching. Yeah\""]
["10:31,300","10:34,500","\"Tim Curry's entertaining the whole way through though. He sure is\""]
["10:34,500","10:40,380","\"Honestly like the new Pennywise he's entertaining too. I would like to see I want to see what they do with him\""]
["10:40,380","10:46,380","\"I've only seen like a few clips here and there it's it's it's more like everything I've seen has put me off from it\""]
["10:46,380","10:49,740","\"But I haven't seen if they can do it subtly if you if it looks\""]
["10:49,740","10:56,040","\"Scare moments. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Yeah, you're not gonna make that work. It gets a clown\""]
["10:56,040","10:59,420","\"Yeah, I actually think it does somehow work cuz he is really scary\""]
["10:59,420","11:02,820","\"Chris\""]
["11:02,820","11:04,980","\"How easily would you say you get scared?\""]
["11:04,980","11:07,940","\"By movies not at all\""]
["11:07,940","11:14,560","\"I assume games do a lot because then it's like you feel the peril. Yeah, I remember how you were reacting with Resident Evil\""]
["11:14,560","11:21,660","\"Oh, Jesus. I remember you got released spooked by Resident Evil 7. Yes, that shit's scary\""]
["11:21,660","11:24,940","\"Fuck, there's another one. W are you?\""]
["11:24,940","11:30,120","\"What are horror movies that scared you to death? Are there? Yeah, are there any?\""]
["11:30,120","11:34,140","\"That scared me genuinely like I don't know. Let me think\""]
["11:35,940","11:39,620","\"The first time I watched evil that - it really freaked me out. I\""]
["11:39,620","11:45,020","\"Dearly love it was to be funny though. I dearly love that laughing scene. Me too. It's the best part\""]

["11:49,780","11:52,980","\"Oh a little thing\""]
["11:52,980","11:57,260","\"Ding dong. Uh-huh. Would you be frustrated with me if\""]
["11:57,260","12:02,460","\"I asked you to move in with me and my everything in my house was constantly laughing\""]
["12:03,820","12:05,820","\"Yeah, the course okay\""]
["12:05,820","12:12,660","\"So I'll uh, I know that's like your intent isn't it you want to annoy no, I just like it. I think it would be fun\""]
["12:12,660","12:17,260","\"I like dragged me to hell quite a lot. Have you seen that? I've never seen that one\""]
["12:17,260","12:18,540","\"That's a what are you talking about?\""]
["12:18,540","12:24,620","\"I feel like there's an original in a remake right or is there only one version not actually sure I think it's original\""]
["12:24,620","12:27,140","\"I don't think there is two versions of it\""]
["12:27,140","12:31,020","\"Yeah, I think probably not yeah\""]
["12:31,700","12:36,760","\"That's what the old lady that is attacking her in her car. Yeah, right so good. I\""]
["12:36,760","12:40,700","\"Love this song when did it come out? I'm trying to remember\""]
["12:40,700","12:44,860","\"Because that was like somewhat recent\""]
["12:44,860","12:51,220","\"What's even down there it's the garbage shoot for all you know, it's just a ball pit\""]
["12:51,220","12:58,660","\"I like that they're hiding instead of leaving as a slow robotic arm moves around the room\""]
["13:01,140","13:03,140","\"I just like they put shit in like this just\""]
["13:03,140","13:10,060","\"I'm glad they set this up for we I think they should be running around and panicking to make it more like exciting\""]
["13:10,060","13:12,060","\"I should be carnival music playing right now\""]
["13:12,060","13:15,040","\"Maybe have flashing lights when you get one in\""]
["13:15,040","13:17,740","\"They shut it down. Oh\""]
["13:17,740","13:23,500","\"You're having too much fun. Oh, so you only have like a limited number of tries to like make the room easier\""]

["13:40,740","13:43,900","\"Maybe I'll dump waste to myself\""]
["13:43,900","13:49,320","\"Would you take the chance to pee in at Chris? Yeah, I mean it's a waste dump\""]
["13:49,320","13:55,720","\"He doesn't pee this whole time. I like peeing in strange places. Maybe he's peed off camera. It's fun every time he uses the typewriter\""]
["13:55,720","13:57,900","\"Maybe right\""]
["13:57,900","13:59,900","\"Will you buying items?\""]

["15:10,580","15:15,300","\"Which leads me to believe that herb is probably correct. I\""]

["20:28,760","20:33,920","\"It's kind of weird how that was a very early adult swim show and everyone kind of forgot about it when it stopped airing\""]
["20:33,920","20:39,860","\"Yeah, it was really hit or miss and it missed more often than a hit wasn't that great?\""]
["20:39,860","20:43,600","\"Yeah, yeah, I've tried a few times and I never really enjoyed it\""]
["20:43,600","20:46,780","\"There's a handful of episodes that are entertaining, but it's kind of a mixed bag\""]
["20:46,780","20:50,620","\"I saw the bizarro wanted it made me. Yeah, that one's I think that's the most popular episode\""]
["20:50,620","20:56,040","\"There isn't even a premise. They're just all tied up and nothing happens\""]
["20:56,800","20:58,800","\"That's perfect\""]

["21:27,060","21:29,740","\"Okay, I think I'm gonna get this one\""]
["21:29,740","21:32,620","\"It's a reference to Flanders killer 7\""]
["21:32,620","21:38,140","\"I'm still very disappointed that Flanders killer 7 was not a killer 7. What would I mean?\""]
["21:38,140","21:40,140","\"What would Simpson's themed killer 7 have been?\""]
["21:40,140","21:47,340","\"Deep political commentary with Simpson's characters delivering it you have to kill Matt greening by the end\""]

["22:08,620","22:14,300","\"You could say I take it back. I think the new Chuck E Cheese is way funnier than the 80s one\""]
["22:14,300","22:16,300","\"You just say that because of the puppet yes\""]
["22:18,940","22:27,300","\"Right because he went for being like a weird creepy animatronic to a tiny puppet who's nervous about everything. Yeah, he's way more of a character with it\""]
["22:27,300","22:31,440","\"He wants to be cool and hip with the kids, but he's also terrified of them\""]
