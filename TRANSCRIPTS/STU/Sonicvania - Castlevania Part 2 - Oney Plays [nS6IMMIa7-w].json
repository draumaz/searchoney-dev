["14:14,840","14:17,840","\"It's honestly a game about trial and error.\""]
["14:17,840","14:22,840","\"So honestly, you're just fighting, like, the clunky momentum.\""]
["14:22,840","14:23,840","\"Yeah, pretty much.\""]
["14:23,840","14:27,840","\"Once you understand how to abuse the momentum, you can pretty much make the game your bet.\""]
["14:27,840","14:32,000","\"is just completely trial and error like it is running through a 2d sonic game is\""]
["14:32,000","14:37,800","\"just like it's just gonna kill you pretty much basically what sonic is like it's\""]
["14:37,800","14:41,160","\"incredibly satisfying to run through a sonic game after you've beaten it and you\""]
["14:41,160","14:45,080","\"understand it but you're basically gonna be bumping around like a dumbass and\""]
["14:45,080","14:48,720","\"getting hurt constantly losing your rings until you master the level and the\""]
["14:48,720","14:52,880","\"layout and then that's when you're like hey guys I can beat sonic to and then\""]
["14:52,880","14:55,600","\"your friends come over and you can show how fucking cool you are my least\""]
["14:55,600","15:02,100","\"I figured like so my least favorite thing about 2dsonic is the camera. It's that it has you focus centered\""]
["15:02,100","15:07,420","\"You're completely centered in the screen. So you're running to the right. You can't see anything coming at you\""]
["15:07,420","15:07,420","\"If you're going to\""]
["15:07,420","15:11,560","\"You know why there's a problem with that is because of how fucking close it is to yeah\""]
["15:11,560","15:18,480","\"That's you when the game's like been re-released is like HD and like expanded the screen so you can see more of the left and more of the right\""]
["15:18,480","15:22,360","\"It makes it so much better. Yeah see stuff coming in and it just makes it more\""]
["15:22,360","15:25,080","\"I understand like when I played Sonic 2 on the Genesis\""]
["15:25,080","15:29,220","\"I pretty much just love the speed it was giving me and the music was amazing and everything\""]
["15:29,220","15:34,120","\"It was just like a fucking sensory overload, but it's also like zoom fucking close to shit\""]
["15:34,120","15:36,560","\"And it's it's not the best to play\""]
["15:36,560","15:43,880","\"You play like the the ones that's been remade by a cushiony crisp quistion white head, and it's like much better\""]
["15:43,880","15:45,560","\"Yeah\""]
["15:45,560","15:48,960","\"Same with Sonic 1 I did I I don't like Sonic 1\""]
["15:48,960","15:53,920","\"Sonic one multiple times never finished it, but I did like the Sonic advanced game. Sonic one a boring\""]
["15:53,920","15:56,960","\"I'm sorry. I hate to say it, but Sonic one is honestly\""]
["15:56,960","16:00,720","\"How is it to parrot the balance on platforms? Are you falling off the lava and then I stop yeah?\""]
["16:00,720","16:03,840","\"Zone fucking god dude. I love the music there though\""]
["16:03,840","16:09,020","\"But uh, I mean like Sonic one like the green hills is fun. It's a good opening stage\""]
["16:09,020","16:11,640","\"It's like iconic with its setup, but then like so good\""]
["16:11,640","16:14,960","\"It just gets kind of monotonous because you go from like Sonic one\""]
["16:15,120","16:21,200","\"It's like you're flying through green hills and you go to marble zone and you kind of meander over lava platforms and like yeah\""]
["16:21,200","16:24,860","\"It's like the worst second level ever. Yeah, and then the next level is\""]
["16:24,860","16:29,620","\"God what is it? It's like the casino place. I believe right?\""]
["16:29,620","16:36,080","\"Yeah, I don't like that one either, but then it's like the water one which is the worst one lab and zone every level\""]
["16:36,080","16:39,280","\"But then then it's starlight and starlight fucking rocks\""]
["16:39,280","16:44,360","\"I love starlight most of the levels just suck the play through and then it's the egg egg zone and it sucks\""]
["16:44,360","16:50,780","\"Yeah, Sonic 2 is just good from start to finish almost every level in Sonic 2 is just like I've never played it\""]
["16:50,780","16:54,940","\"Dude, it moves it moves like the pacing you're gonna beat Sonic 2 in\""]
["16:54,940","16:59,440","\"Less than an hour you could beat it in like 45 really to an hour. Yeah\""]
["16:59,440","17:00,740","\"It's easy\""]
["17:00,740","17:03,500","\"I mean it's not a game if you don't stop to look at it\""]
["17:03,500","17:05,100","\"I look at all the fucking sprite work\""]
["17:05,100","17:08,400","\"You can beat it pretty quickly and Sonic you're not meant to just look at shit\""]
["17:08,400","17:12,620","\"You're supposed to run and let the zone like kind of just breeze by you and the way that it is\""]
["17:12,620","17:18,420","\"Design Sonic 2 was they designed it to keep the momentum going, to keep the motion moving forward.\""]
["17:18,420","17:22,920","\"I will say though that I tried playing Sonic Mania, I couldn't get into it either.\""]
["17:22,920","17:24,020","\"I don't blame you.\""]
["17:24,020","17:25,720","\"The thing about- I still really want to play the average man.\""]
["17:25,720","17:29,920","\"I really like Mania, but it's because of my bias towards Sonic games.\""]
["17:29,920","17:34,720","\"Obviously, so I enjoyed Mania way more than the average person.\""]
["17:34,720","17:39,120","\"But Mania is just like, honestly, some of those stages are like seven minutes long.\""]
["17:39,120","17:40,820","\"I was just playing through it.\""]
["17:40,820","17:46,700","\"See any like real innovation or anything like the graphics were nice. You can say what it actually is Chris\""]
["17:46,700","17:52,820","\"It's just like a glorified mod. Yeah, that's what it is, but I mean I appreciate the effort. Yeah\""]
["17:52,820","17:57,700","\"I mean it's not for me. Have you played Castlevania for? Oh, yeah, I like that one\""]
["17:57,700","18:03,500","\"All directions I just like the music and the art\""]
["18:03,500","18:10,580","\"Honestly, yeah, the gameplay itself is just whatever actually no all right\""]
["18:10,580","18:14,220","\"We're gonna get my kind of get but for was okay, but fucking rondo of blood\""]
["18:14,220","18:20,420","\"Rondo but is run over me fucking rock really? Yes, it is but you're about to say that different\""]
["18:20,420","18:25,940","\"No, the Sega one or the one that they released on Super Ninh no can suck my fucking asshole\""]
["18:25,940","18:31,660","\"Dracula eggs Dracula eggs suck so fucking bad. That was really really good. Yeah, good job\""]
["18:33,740","18:40,060","\"You remember that they were like guys play where the fucking where Richter came from\""]
["18:40,060","18:44,820","\"X no, yeah, I'm gonna tell everybody Jackie likes that's the one they had\""]
["18:44,820","18:51,520","\"You play Rondo blood in this collection pack or you can get like that weird 3d one for PS dude\""]
["18:51,520","18:58,460","\"We should play Rondo. I fucking love Rondo. That had some of the best music in any video game fucking ever\""]
["18:58,460","19:03,360","\"Is that same lady who did it? I don't have no fucking play. It might be she was a mag fest\""]
["19:03,360","19:06,100","\"We were at one time. Yeah, it has like one of the best soundtracks\""]
["19:06,100","19:09,820","\"I would say like every game is just like fucking amazing except for like maybe\""]
["19:09,820","19:16,240","\"The Lord of Shadows. I really like the Lord of Shadows. I tried playing that back in the day and I hated its music\""]
["19:16,240","19:21,540","\"Just it's kind of just more atmospheric this hallways really hard. Also this came this soon\""]
["19:21,540","19:23,860","\"Lord of Shadows was weird. I\""]
["19:24,340","19:29,620","\"Can't I can't really explain it to me the game felt really claustrophobic and then they like put you in rooms\""]
["19:29,620","19:30,620","\"Where you just battle enemies?\""]
["19:30,620","19:35,820","\"We're just like it pretty much comes to a point where you feel like you're just fighting enemies more so than playing the game\""]
["19:35,820","19:36,540","\"Oh\""]
["19:36,540","19:39,020","\"God damn, this is hard. Holy shit. Oh\""]
["19:39,020","19:42,960","\"It's really good Dave. You're doing the old throw the cross through the pit\""]
["19:42,960","19:49,060","\"Jump this is the hardest part of the game hands down. Yeah, this is um, that's in the Dracula fight at the end or tough\""]
["19:49,060","19:51,060","\"Death is intimately difficult\""]
["19:52,660","19:55,020","\"I like the sound of his menu screaming for his life\""]
["19:55,020","19:59,100","\"Actually, I prefer\""]
["19:59,100","20:01,100","\"Castlevania 1 over\""]
["20:01,100","20:05,940","\"Symphony of the night. I prefer how simple it is really just in design. Yeah, this is a damn good game\""]
["20:05,940","20:09,280","\"Even though I never played something red skeletons up top yet\""]
["20:09,280","20:16,220","\"It's not perfect. I'm just saying I wish there was more Castlevania games that weren't like like Metroidvania guys\""]
["20:16,220","20:18,460","\"You should Debbie play Castlevania 3\""]
["20:18,460","20:21,340","\"You and Avi jank you're climbing a fucking river\""]

["20:31,340","20:40,340","\"I wish there were more classic Castlevania games, but you know honestly, um, that game they released that was in Inka Hootz with the new Bloodline game?\""]
["20:40,340","20:41,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:41,340","20:45,340","\"It was simple, but it was nice seeing that kind of aesthetic again.\""]
["20:45,340","20:51,340","\"And I did like it to a degree, but it was like insanely easy for a Castlevania game.\""]
["20:51,340","20:52,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:52,340","20:53,340","\"That's what I could try.\""]
["20:53,340","20:59,840","\"I like the challenge and the grind, and I like just the really simple design, and I like how super linear it is.\""]
