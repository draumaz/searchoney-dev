["00:01,600","00:03,400","\"On a plane!\""]
["00:03,400","00:04,400","\"*Grunts*\""]
["00:04,400","00:10,000","\"This is Shadow we're talking about. Shadow is known to shoot people in his spare good time.\""]
["00:10,000","00:18,500","\"Yeah, he's always packing heat ever since his own game.\""]
["00:18,500","00:19,800","\"Exactly.\""]
["00:19,800","00:26,000","\"Which I never could actually beat that game. It was the only game that I played that I never could get to the end.\""]
["00:26,000","00:29,200","\"Are you guys talking about Shadow the Hedgehog?\""]
["00:29,200","00:35,200","\"Shut up, Hedgehog for me was really easy on GameCube version.\""]
["00:35,200","00:37,200","\"Yeah, it was really easy.\""]
["00:37,200","00:43,200","\"Yeah, well, I decided to skip past the easy mode.\""]
["00:43,200","00:46,200","\"I played it on absolutely the most insane difficulty ever.\""]
["00:46,200","00:48,200","\"Whoa, you're epic.\""]
["00:48,200","00:50,200","\"Whoa.\""]
["00:50,200","00:56,200","\"I actually managed though after two weeks of trying to beat it on the absolute insane difficulty,\""]
["00:56,200","01:00,120","\"difficulty which would be the secret difficulty known as kiss your ass goodbye\""]
["01:00,120","01:05,120","\"you did that yes\""]
["01:05,120","01:15,600","\"whoa achievement of my gaming career that's really cool I'm also I'm also proud to\""]
["01:15,600","01:21,400","\"say this I did it without taking a single bit of damage you're lying I don't\""]
["01:21,400","01:22,400","\"I don't believe that.\""]
["01:22,400","01:27,400","\"I have a picture on my phone to prove it.\""]
["01:27,400","01:30,400","\"Okay, okay, send it.\""]
["01:30,400","01:35,400","\"I'd have to upload it to the computer, then upload it to SL.\""]
["01:35,400","01:36,400","\"Yes.\""]
["01:36,400","01:39,400","\"And unfortunately my phone is dead at the damn moment.\""]
["01:39,400","01:41,400","\"I think you're lying.\""]
["01:41,400","01:48,400","\"I think what you will, doesn't matter to me.\""]
["01:48,400","01:50,400","\"You're entitled to your own opinion.\""]
["01:50,400","01:56,760","\"I think your armor is an overcompensation because you're lying to us.\""]
["01:56,760","02:11,120","\"If you won't upload it now, I don't believe you.\""]
["02:11,120","02:15,920","\"What is the other coolest gaming achievement you've done?\""]
["02:15,920","02:18,920","\"Well, that one was a bit...\""]
["02:18,920","02:22,920","\"...of a challenge.\""]
["02:22,920","02:28,920","\"You know the Metal Gear game series, correct?\""]
["02:28,920","02:29,920","\"Correct.\""]
["02:29,920","02:34,920","\"You know, the one where you play as Jack Wright and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance?\""]
["02:34,920","02:36,920","\"Yes, I love that game.\""]
["02:36,920","02:44,920","\"I've managed to play every single difficulty and managed to get an S-rank on every mission.\""]
["02:44,920","02:58,920","\"every mission. No way. Yes. You must be pretty cool. Only one weapon. One? Yep. Wow. Using\""]
["02:58,920","03:09,520","\"Samuel Rodriguez's HF. Mirasama. That's my favorite one. Which believe it or not, I'm\""]
["03:09,520","03:18,040","\"actually carrying an SL. What? Yep want to see? Yes. Let me just un-sheet this\""]
["03:18,040","03:21,240","\"little beauty of a blade.\""]
["03:21,240","03:35,280","\"Hello! Hey Jeff, you're a soma! Whoa! That's so cool. This is my pride and joy blade.\""]
["03:35,280","03:37,280","\"Another katana.\""]
["03:37,280","03:44,280","\"But with electrical crackly things.\""]
["03:44,280","03:50,280","\"It reminds me of the shock sword from Fallout.\""]
["03:50,280","03:54,280","\"Oh, the shock sword from Fallout from 3.\""]
["03:54,280","03:56,280","\"Even though it's handled to this baby.\""]
["03:56,280","03:58,280","\"This baby could cut that thing in half.\""]
["03:58,280","04:03,280","\"Wow, can you slice me in half with it?\""]
["04:03,280","04:10,280","\"I won't use my blade on an innocent person. I will only use this blade to kill evil.\""]
["04:10,280","04:12,280","\"Thank you.\""]
["04:12,280","04:13,280","\"Awesome.\""]
["04:13,280","04:23,280","\"This tank cost me 1,250L and it was the best investment I ever made.\""]
["04:23,280","04:26,280","\"How much IRL dollars is that?\""]
["04:26,280","04:33,280","\"Well, $2,520, so it was about like $15 for me.\""]
["04:33,280","04:42,280","\"I usually buy spaceships with those prices.\""]
["04:42,280","04:46,280","\"Is that the most you've ever spent in SL?\""]
["04:46,280","04:53,280","\"No, the most I ever spent on SL was on this armor, which cost me $8,888.\""]
["04:53,280","04:55,280","\"How much dollars is that?\""]
["04:55,280","04:57,280","\"That was about...\""]
["04:57,280","04:59,280","\"$52.\""]
["04:59,280","05:04,280","\"Shit.\""]
["05:04,280","05:05,280","\"That's worth it.\""]
["05:05,280","05:09,280","\"I'd be buying land with that much.\""]
["05:09,280","05:10,280","\"And here's what's funny.\""]
["05:10,280","05:12,280","\"You know the DCS combat hood?\""]
["05:12,280","05:16,280","\"I heard of it.\""]
["05:16,280","05:17,280","\"Yes.\""]
["05:17,280","05:21,280","\"This armor has a little built-in script for the DCS hood.\""]
["05:21,280","05:26,700","\"As long as I wear it, I cannot be injured by any DCS user.\""]
["05:26,700","05:27,700","\"No way!\""]
["05:27,700","05:28,700","\"At all!\""]
["05:28,700","05:34,440","\"You're like the coolest person I've ever met in SL.\""]
["05:34,440","05:42,480","\"Well, that's why my tag says \"\"royal family\"\" because I run a group on here where I'm the\""]
["05:42,480","05:49,880","\"patriarch, which is why my name is Genesis Valentine.\""]
["05:49,880","05:50,880","\"That's really cool.\""]
["05:50,880","05:58,560","\"reminds me of Final Fantasy 7.\""]
["05:58,560","06:05,920","\"My family has one rule that must be followed at all times.\""]
["06:05,920","06:07,400","\"Fight with honor.\""]
["06:07,400","06:16,800","\"Never resort to underhanded tactics to win a battle.\""]
["06:16,800","06:18,160","\"Can you make another speech?\""]
["06:18,160","06:21,080","\"That was really cool.\""]
["06:21,080","06:23,080","\"I would be delighted.\""]
["06:23,080","06:39,920","\"Of course, I have fought underhanded once, but that was a long, long time ago.\""]
["06:39,920","06:53,160","\"Now before I inherited this beautiful blade, I was a bit of an underhanded cheating scoundrel.\""]
["06:53,160","06:57,720","\"And because of my underhanded ways, I became cursed.\""]
["06:57,720","07:10,520","\"This curse turned me into a demon, which is why I have horns.\""]
["07:10,520","07:22,220","\"It almost reminds me of nightmare for Soul Collabur.\""]
["07:22,220","07:27,680","\"Believe it or not, some people have actually called me a nightmare.\""]
["07:27,680","07:29,680","\"You're pointing your sword.\""]
["07:29,680","07:34,680","\"The actual character Siegfried.\""]
["07:34,680","07:54,680","\"You're actually kind of lucky that I put the blade back.\""]
["07:54,680","07:59,800","\"If you would have been a little closer, just from being around the blade, if you had a health\""]
["07:59,800","08:03,320","\"bar above you, the health bar would slowly start draining down to zero.\""]
["08:03,320","08:06,360","\"What?\""]
["08:06,360","08:15,320","\"Whoa. The heat of the blade does environmental damage, which slowly kills my opponent.\""]
["08:15,320","08:18,360","\"Over time, but it still slowly kills them.\""]
["08:18,360","08:22,200","\"That's why I paid so much for it.\""]
["08:22,200","08:27,800","\"I'll give you five second life for it.\""]
["08:27,800","08:33,240","\"It's non-transferable unfortunately.\""]
["08:33,240","08:35,740","\"What?\""]
["08:35,740","08:39,640","\"Yep, I can't even modify this thing.\""]
["08:39,640","08:42,800","\"It's no mod, no copy, no trans.\""]
["08:42,800","08:43,800","\"Wow!\""]
["08:43,800","08:49,400","\"That is really easy to lose.\""]
["08:49,400","08:58,760","\"Oh, that's why I have a little special trick.\""]
["08:58,760","09:06,960","\"I asked the seller when I bought it if my version could be copied and he was nice enough\""]
["09:06,960","09:15,040","\"to grant me that privilege.\""]
["09:15,040","09:22,040","\"I have a version for the garrion combat meter, DCS, carnage, and linden labs damage.\""]
["09:22,040","09:28,040","\"Wow!\""]
["09:28,040","09:36,040","\"The carnage one though, I kind of can't use because it's too overpowered.\""]
["09:36,040","09:41,040","\"Would you say it's over 9000?\""]
["09:43,040","09:47,040","\"I don't even think the Dragon Balls of you joke would be a right estimate for that thing.\""]
["09:47,040","09:53,280","\"I actually used it on someone and they kind of immediately lagged and logged off of Second Life\""]
["09:53,280","10:02,640","\"and they haven't been seen again. Whoa! Whoa! It breaks through the fourth wall and destroys\""]
["10:02,640","10:06,400","\"your opponent's computer. You killed him, I'll rule!\""]
["10:10,080","10:12,080","\"And I only hit him once and next thing you know\""]
["10:12,080","10:14,080","\"*coughs*\""]
["10:14,080","10:18,080","\"*coughs*\""]
["10:18,080","10:22,080","\"I challenge you to...\""]
["10:22,080","10:24,080","\"I challenge you to a...\""]
["10:24,080","10:26,080","\"a fuck.\""]
["10:26,080","10:28,080","\"*coughs*\""]
["10:28,080","10:30,080","\"He challenges you to a fuck.\""]
["10:30,080","10:32,080","\"*coughs*\""]
["10:32,080","10:38,080","\"The only reason I used that particular version of the blade was because the guy was insulting my daughter.\""]
["10:38,080","10:40,080","\"What did he say about her?\""]
["10:40,080","10:47,080","\"Basically called her a lying horrid piece of trash that deserves to basically die in a ditch somewhere.\""]
["10:47,080","10:49,080","\"What?\""]
["10:49,080","10:51,080","\"Yep.\""]
["10:51,080","10:52,080","\"Terrible.\""]
["10:52,080","10:53,080","\"Did you kill?\""]
["10:53,080","10:54,080","\"Exactly.\""]
["10:54,080","10:58,080","\"Oh, I tore that fucker to pieces.\""]
["10:58,080","11:00,080","\"And I enjoyed every second of it!\""]
["11:00,080","11:01,080","\"Yeah!\""]
["11:01,080","11:02,080","\"Yeah!\""]
["11:02,080","11:06,080","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
