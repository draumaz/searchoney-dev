["01:18,720","01:25,000","\"I tried playing it on an emulator when I was like 14 and I couldn't get past this part. Okay. That's all you do, huh?\""]
["01:26,200","01:31,400","\"Yeah, interesting. Yeah, you jump into pieces of paper to play levels. This is a nightmare\""]
["01:31,400","01:36,160","\"Yeah, this is a bad dream, I guess he doesn't like this movie\""]
["01:36,160","01:38,700","\"I literally walked up and down that street for like 20 minutes\""]
["01:38,700","01:42,600","\"Yeah, you have to find pieces of paper to jump into there's a lot of stuff in this game\""]
["01:42,600","01:45,640","\"You're just not gonna know until you play it intuitive. I think I'm just dead\""]

["02:21,720","02:26,480","\"Yeah, these Z's you have to catch them with bubbles you blow but see the bubbles you blow\""]
["02:26,480","02:29,480","\"They're also attached to a collectible so you have to collect bubblegums\""]
["02:29,480","02:33,640","\"So you can blow bubbles and then use the bubbles to collect the Z's which go in the Z meter at the top of the screen\""]
["02:33,640","02:36,720","\"But the Z's can only go inside these boundaries set right here\""]
["02:36,720","02:41,160","\"And also you have to hold the Y button down if you want to move the bubble around which the game doesn't tell you what?\""]

["03:12,300","03:15,160","\"Are you telling me these germs are not a reference?\""]
["03:15,840","03:20,640","\"They're not from like season two episode eight. They're the germs that come to the nuclear power plant\""]

["08:13,240","08:18,240","\"Yes, I am\""]
["08:18,240","08:22,240","\"I hate her. Oh\""]
["08:22,240","08:24,360","\"My god\""]
["08:24,360","08:30,400","\"We're almost there. Are you ready? I'm really surprised none of these have music but like I'm not bothered by it\""]
["08:30,400","08:36,720","\"Actually fine. No, it's actually great. It's wonderful. I'm not bothered. It's okay. Yeah sure\""]
["08:37,320","08:41,300","\"That's Homer. There's Homer. He looks funnier in the show as a monkey\""]
["08:41,300","08:49,440","\"Why is he dressed like that? He's a peasant from ancient times a giant peasant. Yeah, see it's big crust in hilarious\""]
["08:49,440","08:55,440","\"Your response wasn't laughter it was you going\""]
["08:55,440","09:05,520","\"You're so right I didn't even laugh I was on the defense\""]
["09:05,520","09:10,800","\"Oh, oh, oh, oh, you're trying to abort you.\""]
["09:10,800","09:13,440","\"Yeah, with the signal.\""]
["09:13,440","09:14,440","\"A board board.\""]
["09:14,440","09:16,880","\"Oh, wait, we got to get that.\""]
["09:16,880","09:17,880","\"Do you know what that does?\""]
["09:17,880","09:18,880","\"What does that do?\""]
["09:18,880","09:20,400","\"It looks like three of them.\""]
["09:20,400","09:24,880","\"It gives you an extra meter when you run out of health.\""]
["09:24,880","09:26,380","\"That bus comes out of fucking nowhere.\""]
["09:26,380","09:27,380","\"Yes, it does.\""]
["09:27,380","09:29,800","\"And it's really annoying because it blocks your view.\""]
["09:29,800","09:31,120","\"It's a foreground element.\""]
["09:31,120","09:32,120","\"It sucks.\""]
["09:32,120","09:35,480","\"I'll see you move slower when you have this, but you're invincible.\""]
["09:35,480","09:37,080","\"See, that didn't hurt.\""]
["09:37,080","09:40,680","\"I wish grandpa was walking in the background following you whistling this song.\""]
["09:40,680","09:43,080","\"I wish there were ghosts of grandpa here.\""]
["09:43,080","09:45,280","\"That's 50 of them walking around.\""]
["09:45,280","09:47,880","\"I feel like that's more believable than Nightmare for Bart.\""]
["09:47,880","09:49,280","\"Does grandpa show up in this game?\""]
["09:49,280","09:50,280","\"I don't remember.\""]
["09:50,280","09:51,280","\"No, I don't think he does.\""]
["09:51,280","09:52,280","\"This is a nightmare.\""]
["09:52,280","09:53,280","\"There you go.\""]
["09:53,280","09:56,680","\"It only took you like 10 minutes to find the facts.\""]
["09:56,680","09:58,480","\"This game just isn't that good.\""]
["09:58,480","10:01,480","\"It's better than most.\""]
["10:01,480","10:03,280","\"It's one of the better Simpsons games.\""]
["10:03,280","10:04,280","\"It's not very good.\""]
["10:04,280","10:07,760","\"But this is the famous nostalgia critical display.\""]
["10:07,760","10:10,520","\"I think it gets points for being weird.\""]
["10:10,520","10:15,240","\"I remember he referenced that video that he said like,\""]
["10:15,240","10:17,360","\"well, I don't want to have another Bart's nightmare,\""]
["10:17,360","10:19,520","\"but it's like, I don't think you understand why that video\""]
["10:19,520","10:23,240","\"didn't work because it's just like his regular content.\""]
["10:23,240","10:25,640","\"You pointed out that the same thing happened with the wall\""]
["10:25,640","10:27,960","\"and that it was the idea of like every time he.\""]
["10:27,960","10:31,200","\"It's when a different community gets exposed to it.\""]
["10:31,200","10:33,800","\"Yes, that it's the idea of people that are not used\""]
["10:33,800","10:36,360","\"putting up with his bullshit they're like what the fuck is this?\""]
["10:36,360","10:37,840","\"*laughing*\""]
["10:37,840","10:42,500","\"And then the next video, his next nostalgia critic, he does a big apology in front of Congress.\""]
["10:42,500","10:43,500","\"It was really strange.\""]
["10:43,500","10:46,000","\"There's real footage of him going out in public and doing that.\""]
["10:46,000","10:49,800","\"You can tell that he's not like commentating over as he's playing, you can tell it's like\""]
["10:49,800","10:50,800","\"done in post.\""]
["10:50,800","10:52,800","\"It is, yeah you can tell that some of it.\""]
["10:52,800","10:54,800","\"Which is a very strange decision.\""]
["10:54,800","10:56,800","\"*screaming* I like that, it's my mirror.\""]
["10:56,800","10:58,800","\"Why is he a cat?\""]

["11:02,800","11:06,520","\"That a kid was that a thing I want to say it was a it was\""]
["11:06,520","11:11,440","\"Contest it was a first-tona contest. Oh, yeah\""]
["11:11,440","11:16,560","\"You did that he won they won by making it the nostalgia crock\""]
["11:16,560","11:23,880","\"But it was a Pokemon that's so he he wanted a furry of himself. Yeah, he should have been one of those long-nosed monkeys\""]

["25:42,420","25:43,940","\"Like your parents set this rule.\""]
["25:43,940","25:45,420","\"Yeah, for like a few years.\""]
["25:45,420","25:49,580","\"And this was the game that just made a lot of trouble.\""]
["25:49,580","25:51,180","\"That is the weirdest thing I've ever heard.\""]
["25:51,180","25:53,540","\"So I had to learn this stupid thing inside and out.\""]
["25:53,540","25:57,740","\"Now what it was it just because they were like, oh, we don't want to keep buying a new thing. Yes.\""]
["25:57,740","26:02,460","\"And it's fair games were expensive. Games still are expensive. They're getting more expensive.\""]
["26:02,460","26:05,020","\"Yeah, definitely. Some studios want to increase prices.\""]
["26:05,020","26:07,260","\"I grew up poor. I could only have a couple of games.\""]
["26:07,260","26:09,940","\"So if they sucked, it would have been bad.\""]

["26:13,220","26:19,500","\"Like, you're the expert with inflation and with how much games cost to make now.\""]
["26:20,220","26:25,940","\"I mean, the thing is, it's that budgets have been running out of control because everything keeps improving and getting more expensive.\""]
["26:25,940","26:26,440","\"Mm.\""]
["26:26,440","26:30,660","\"Well, it was the budget again for GTA 5, like half a billion or something.\""]

["26:31,740","26:33,280","\"They made so much more.\""]
["26:33,280","26:37,580","\"Well, sure, they made the money, but it also means you're putting all that trouble and effort and time into it.\""]
["26:37,580","26:38,320","\"True.\""]
["26:38,320","26:40,660","\"All those developers working on crunch and everything too.\""]
["26:40,660","26:42,260","\"It really sucks for that.\""]
["26:42,260","26:46,180","\"Especially because a lot of them even aren't getting paid that much in a lot of positions.\""]
["26:46,180","26:47,900","\"It's really thankless work.\""]
["26:49,260","26:57,220","\"I guess that's a good point. Whether or not inflation should be going that drastically would come down to like, okay, how is the pay getting?\""]
["26:57,220","26:59,460","\"Well, yeah, are you actually properly paying them?\""]
["26:59,460","27:04,380","\"Or is it just out of the executives that are they taking us here and raise ourselves?\""]

["43:59,340","44:03,700","\"It's that you still have to yeah make the judgment as to when to do the second and when to do it\""]

["44:51,660","44:53,660","\"I mean that depends\""]
["44:53,660","45:02,020","\"Almost it's hard to set concrete moves. I think that's just kind of a problem with internet culture in general. It's very absolutous\""]
