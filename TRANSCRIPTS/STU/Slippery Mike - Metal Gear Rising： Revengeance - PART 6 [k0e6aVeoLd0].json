["05:17,720","05:21,980","\"Yeah, they used to just be able to make those I guess they still can\""]
["05:21,980","05:27,380","\"Yeah, still do they do they they're doing it like crazy right now in South Korea\""]
["05:27,380","05:31,400","\"like they're they're going through their like\""]
["05:32,140","05:39,760","\"like manufactured pop band phase or something that we went through in like the late 90s through early 2000s\""]
["05:39,760","05:45,280","\"Yeah, I think the internet's kind of fucked it up a little bit where it's like people have just been able to make their own\""]

["06:04,500","06:06,220","\"I know one guy did that shit.\""]
["06:06,220","06:12,740","\"And it's supposedly there's a huge spy cam epidemic going on over there that I've heard about.\""]
["06:12,740","06:15,740","\"I'm sure that's going on over here too.\""]
["06:15,740","06:21,700","\"Where like there's a lot of bathrooms like I would never trust a hotel room not to have a spy cabinet at this point.\""]
["06:21,700","06:22,700","\"That's creepy.\""]
["06:22,700","06:23,980","\"I don't want to think about that.\""]

["06:30,380","06:32,380","\"Probably.\""]
["06:32,380","06:37,700","\"And that's all they want. That's why right before you walk into a hotel you jerk off in your car for like a minute\""]
["06:37,700","06:43,120","\"So you get like kind of a hard-on and then when you take off your pants to show the spy camera you got kind of a chub\""]
["06:43,120","06:49,200","\"This is just hoteling 101. I can't believe anyone doesn't know that. Basic hotel etiquette. I\""]

["07:58,440","08:02,740","\"And I don't mean like a video game or P G. I mean like a rocket\""]

["11:31,560","11:36,840","\"Because you know like Kakarot's like a carrot and Vegeta's like a vegetable\""]
["11:36,840","11:40,480","\"I like the idea that Yamcha is kind of the opposite of a yamcha\""]
["11:40,480","11:45,200","\"Whereas like it it's like the opposite of a crater that he is always in that picture\""]

["12:25,920","12:27,920","\"eventually like given a long enough period\""]
["12:27,920","12:30,640","\"of time wandering any setting, someone would kill you.\""]
["12:30,640","12:31,480","\"- I think so too.\""]

["12:38,520","12:40,960","\"It was a robot that was like just programmed to hitchhike.\""]
["12:40,960","12:43,200","\"- It was like an experiment to see like\""]
["12:43,200","12:45,400","\"how far this robot could get.\""]
["12:45,400","12:46,240","\"- And then someone killed it?\""]
["12:46,240","12:49,000","\"- Yeah, someone killed it like the second day.\""]
["12:49,000","12:50,000","\"- What?\""]

["12:59,120","12:59,960","\"And yeah, so.\""]

["13:07,480","13:13,640","\"Look it out. I'm never heard of this. It was a hitchhiking robot. This is maybe like 2011 or something\""]
["13:13,640","13:16,540","\"It also confuses me that you're explaining it looks like a trash can\""]
["13:16,540","13:20,040","\"Why the fuck would anything why would anyone stop to pick that up because it look it?\""]
["13:20,040","13:23,960","\"It tells you to pick it up. It should have looked more like a human hitchhiking\""]
["13:23,960","13:30,800","\"So now that would put it in like uncanny valley territory, but at least the robot could say like hello\""]
["13:30,800","13:33,760","\"I am a robot, so this is what it looked like\""]
["13:34,400","13:40,300","\"Okay, that looks okay. That looks like a humanoid figure. Okay, apparently it made it through like a bunch of other countries\""]
["13:40,300","13:41,960","\"and\""]
["13:41,960","13:43,960","\"Then it went to Pennsylvania\""]
["13:43,960","13:46,800","\"It got destroyed. I\""]
["13:46,800","13:52,600","\"Can't believe that. Oh, apparently its final moments were caught on their surveillance tape. Oh, no\""]
["13:52,600","13:56,560","\"Yeah, it's actually sad. I mean, it's not look at it shouldn't be\""]
["13:56,560","14:03,000","\"Why did they kill him he got he did get decapitated\""]
["14:03,000","14:11,320","\"He actually got decapitated. That's probably an affront to someone. I don't know. I think\""]
["14:11,320","14:15,880","\"somebody just thought they were cool and edgy. And they killed the hit. Do you think the\""]
["14:15,880","14:21,400","\"person that killed it knew what it was? Yeah, this doesn't make it two weeks in the US.\""]
["14:21,400","14:25,440","\"That's what they get for playing God. What its name was? What? Do you think the people\""]
["14:25,440","14:29,440","\"that killed it knew what it was or it was just like, what that darn thing doing there?\""]
["14:29,440","14:30,440","\"Kill it.\""]
["14:30,440","14:32,440","\"Get that little varmint.\""]
["14:32,440","14:34,160","\"It was just a stupid American.\""]
["14:34,160","14:37,360","\"That thing don't look like me.\""]
["14:37,360","14:39,160","\"Bang bang.\""]
["14:39,160","14:44,680","\"Oh, would you stop blowing up military vehicles for one minute?\""]
["14:44,680","14:49,320","\"Would you stop personifying every machine you see?\""]
["14:49,320","14:52,640","\"Not all of them are a hitchhiking robot.\""]
["14:52,640","14:56,040","\"Not all of them are hitchhiking robots.\""]
["14:56,040","15:00,680","\"But I don't know the way you said that reminded me of zoid bird\""]
["15:00,680","15:03,320","\"Chacken roll book\""]
["15:03,320","15:09,740","\"Have you guys seen uncut gems? Yeah, I just watched it for the first time. Did you like it? I?\""]
["15:09,740","15:16,840","\"Don't I'm still not sure but it's fucking intense and stressful the entire fucking movie. Yeah, I I\""]
["15:16,840","15:21,620","\"Would not watch it again. I've never seen yeah, I don't really want to watch it again\""]
["15:22,160","15:25,900","\"I'll watch it. I'm not like it's not one of those movies where I go\""]
["15:25,900","15:29,620","\"I wish I never wasted my time with that like I'm glad I saw it\""]
["15:29,620","15:35,860","\"But I don't know if I liked it. It's so not a normal Adam Sandler movie at all\""]
["15:35,860","15:41,440","\"And it's really stressful like from start to finish. Yeah, it never shuts the fuck up\""]
["15:41,440","15:45,000","\"That's it seems by design. Yeah, no it is\""]
["15:45,000","15:51,340","\"So basically Chris the the whole thing with the movie is it's just constant noise and the characters never stop talking\""]
["15:51,340","15:53,600","\"and they're constantly talking over each other.\""]
["15:53,600","15:54,440","\"- Okay.\""]
["15:54,440","15:55,600","\"- On purpose.\""]
["15:55,600","15:57,420","\"- Okay, that sounds weird.\""]
["15:57,420","16:00,140","\"I'll give it a try, I'll give it a shot.\""]
["16:00,140","16:02,020","\"- Like the person I went and saw the movie with,\""]
["16:02,020","16:03,340","\"like when I got out of it was like,\""]
["16:03,340","16:05,620","\"that fucking movie gave me a migraine.\""]
["16:05,620","16:07,540","\"(laughs)\""]
["16:07,540","16:08,900","\"- Okay.\""]
["16:08,900","16:09,720","\"- Oh.\""]
["16:09,720","16:12,220","\"- Oh, I wouldn't trust that thing.\""]
["16:12,220","16:14,660","\"- Why, what's it gonna do, fall?\""]
["16:14,660","16:17,380","\"They're rated for the highest level of safety, Chris.\""]
["16:17,380","16:20,260","\"Get the fuck out of my way, you stupid bitch fence.\""]
["16:20,260","16:25,600","\"Too bad no one's renewed that cool little certificate inside of it in the last four years. Yeah\""]
["16:25,600","16:29,100","\"This is what happens when you fuck with the elevator\""]
["16:29,100","16:34,840","\"Yeah, that's what King, Elavato did he made the first elevator and then he cut the wires with him in it\""]
["16:34,840","16:39,860","\"And then he laughed as he plummeted to his death and everyone went that's a good invention\""]
["16:39,860","16:46,120","\"Yeah, he gave his life so that we could have elevators\""]
["16:47,900","16:50,800","\"It's like um no, he actually did that\""]
["16:50,800","16:55,600","\"I don't remember who invented the elevator or who paid to say he invented the elevator\""]
["16:55,600","17:00,900","\"But he like cut the cables of an elevator with him in it and just let it like fall and stop itself\""]
["17:00,900","17:05,900","\"And was like see totally safe and then the guy who made segues was like check this out\""]
["17:05,900","17:11,420","\"Yeah, the guy yeah fucking story went off a cliff in it wait did the segue guy really yeah\""]
["17:11,420","17:13,840","\"Yeah, writing his invention off a cliff\""]
["17:13,840","17:18,880","\"Yeah, someone cut his breaks and he went over a cliff going 12 miles per hour because he just couldn't get I\""]
["17:18,880","17:22,360","\"I don't know how that works, but that is actually a true story\""]
["17:22,360","17:29,080","\"I was gonna say the I thought the big advantage to a segue in terms of safety was if all else fails\""]
["17:29,080","17:33,980","\"You literally just have to step off of it. Yeah, you know what? I hate that segues\""]
["17:33,980","17:38,520","\"Didn't really catch on I think they're cool. I think they're a good idea\""]
["17:38,520","17:42,200","\"I'm okay with them not catching on in the form that they originally took\""]
["17:43,160","17:48,520","\"They guess they kind of became hoverboards those things. Yeah, this is like your your anti-croc by it\""]
["17:48,520","17:50,620","\"Why didn't that let me fucking kill him?\""]
["17:50,620","17:57,340","\"Cuz video games are not fun and they all suck and nobody plays them anymore. Okay. Yeah, that is one thing\""]
["17:57,340","18:03,980","\"I actually don't like about this game is like it's kind of finicky with when it will give you the command prompt to like stab something in the back\""]
["18:03,980","18:08,760","\"I don't even know why they bother like this is not designed to be a stealth game\""]
["18:09,320","18:15,680","\"There are stealth segments like this is definitely a point where you're kind of supposed to like sneak past these things\""]
["18:15,680","18:22,280","\"Make shit up a little bit. Yeah, come on. Tomar. Usually every bad choice in a video game comes from them trying to make shit up a bit\""]
["18:22,280","18:31,080","\"Yeah, can it can you either one of you think of like any game that is not a stealth game that's like benefited from stealth mechanics?\""]
["18:31,080","18:34,160","\"No\""]
["18:34,760","18:40,180","\"No every game that's not a stealth game that has stuff and it doesn't do it right and it always sucks\""]
["18:40,180","18:45,200","\"I guess to a certain extent I maybe like uncharted maybe\""]
["18:45,200","18:51,280","\"Because I don't because you can never tell when you're breaking the rules or not or when it like I\""]
["18:51,280","18:56,360","\"Never tell what when an enemy is like able to look around the corner like yeah\""]
["18:56,360","18:58,080","\"It's always finicky and shit\""]
["18:58,080","19:03,720","\"I would say that the design philosophy behind that is you're not supposed to stealth your way through everything\""]
["19:03,720","19:07,560","\"You're just you're kind of it's supposed to go tits up at some point\""]
["19:07,560","19:12,440","\"What's that one game where you have all the cool evil powers prototype?\""]
["19:12,440","19:15,080","\"No, not that one\""]
["19:15,080","19:22,600","\"It's kind of steampunk-y. Oh dishonors, but that is a stealth game. I was gonna say I was completely designed around it\""]
["19:22,600","19:25,480","\"I like to stealth in that but I guess you're right that really is a stealth game. Yeah\""]
["19:25,480","19:32,640","\"Non-stealth games just putting stealth in them. Yeah, I feel like it's almost always done really badly\""]
["19:32,640","19:39,020","\"Yeah, you know what the last of us is supposed to have stealth in it because you're avoiding zombies and all this other shit\""]
["19:39,020","19:42,720","\"But it feels completely shit at all times\""]
["19:42,720","19:48,280","\"I have a weird relationship with that game because I never really liked it from the get-go even like\""]
["19:48,280","19:54,160","\"Maybe it's because it was talked up to me so much before I played it. Yeah, I never finished it\""]
["19:54,160","20:02,320","\"So I don't even know like the story or anything. I genuinely love that game. That's just me. Yeah, but well you forget that you're an idiot and stupid\""]
["20:02,320","20:06,940","\"I do forget that okay, I'm gonna be a serious devil's advocate moment, but uh, so\""]
["20:06,940","20:11,500","\"Then ps2 games were usually about sixty dollars sixty euros\""]
["20:11,500","20:18,960","\"Then ps3 games started off at like 65 70 and then teeter back down to 60 because everyone was getting mad at how expensive they were right?\""]
["20:18,960","20:24,840","\"so all throughout time they've kind of stayed around 60 yeah, but\""]
["20:24,840","20:32,200","\"Games are getting incredibly expensive to make it with like how crazy graphics are getting and they have to stay up to that standard\""]
["20:32,200","20:39,620","\"And those same games are just are usually so incredibly profitable to sell such high volumes a good point\""]
["20:39,620","20:46,560","\"Yeah, I think they could still make a ton of money selling a GTA game for 60 bucks, you know, you're right, but also\""]
["20:46,560","20:49,300","\"What was gonna say inflation?\""]
["20:49,300","20:56,840","\"Yeah, here's my thing with this is I feel like games are getting way more expensive to make and that's why every single fucking game has like a\""]
["20:56,840","21:00,400","\"DLC like road map and fucking\""]
["21:01,160","21:03,480","\"microtransactions and things like that.\""]
["21:03,480","21:05,400","\"- That's what the industry realized\""]
["21:05,400","21:07,240","\"got the least amount of pushback.\""]
["21:07,240","21:08,080","\"- Yeah.\""]
["21:08,080","21:08,900","\"- I don't know. - I don't know.\""]
["21:08,900","21:09,740","\"- I don't know. - I don't know.\""]
["21:09,740","21:11,840","\"- I realized that I might be in the minority on this.\""]
["21:11,840","21:14,840","\"I would be totally fine if games were like 80 bucks\""]
["21:14,840","21:16,960","\"and I didn't have to deal with any of that ever.\""]
["21:16,960","21:20,240","\"Like I would be totally fine with that.\""]
["21:20,240","21:22,120","\"But here's the thing like,\""]
["21:22,120","21:23,840","\"even now, like even knowing all that,\""]
["21:23,840","21:25,240","\"if someone was like, \"\"This game's $80,\"\"\""]
["21:25,240","21:26,720","\"I'd be like, \"\"Nope.\"\"\""]
["21:26,720","21:28,440","\"Like that's too fucking expensive.\""]
["21:28,440","21:33,420","\"I feel like I only pay $60 for maybe four or five games a year though.\""]
["21:33,420","21:35,820","\"Most things I will just wait till they're cheaper.\""]
["21:35,820","21:37,160","\"I always wait till they're cheaper.\""]
["21:37,160","21:42,220","\"Dude, gaming is number one, I think a better hobby and number two, a way cheaper hobby.\""]
["21:42,220","21:45,620","\"If you just stay a year or two behind the times.\""]
["21:45,620","21:46,120","\"Yeah.\""]
["21:46,120","21:46,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["21:46,620","21:51,800","\"You can get shit like, I'll get shit like fucking, I got Horizon Zero done for $3.\""]
["21:51,800","21:52,720","\"That's crazy.\""]
["21:52,720","21:57,220","\"Which is like, for three bucks, even if I never play it, which I have, I played it for like two hours\""]
["21:57,220","22:00,440","\"I was like, okay, I think I got the gist of this and like put it down and I was like alright\""]
["22:00,440","22:05,080","\"That was worth three dollars say I preordered that and then didn't even wind up playing it because I just watched\""]
["22:05,080","22:07,240","\"Jaxie play the whole thing. I'd be happy\""]
["22:07,240","22:12,800","\"Like sixty to a hundred dollars on a game if I knew it was gonna last me like two weeks\""]
["22:12,800","22:17,680","\"But also most new games like they just kind of stink\""]
["22:17,680","22:23,840","\"It's a huge investment just the big that's like that's the other thing is it if you stay a little bit behind the times\""]
["22:23,840","22:27,740","\"You can just like you could feel out whether you know you'd like it or not\""]
["22:27,740","22:32,660","\"Yeah, you can also see if people still talk about that game like a year later\""]
["22:32,660","22:37,300","\"You know most of these games that that's my new metric if I'm just buying it for myself\""]
["22:37,300","22:42,460","\"Is if people are still talking about it like a month after it comes out then I'm like, okay?\""]
["22:42,460","22:44,460","\"This is a good game. Who's this guy's name again?\""]
