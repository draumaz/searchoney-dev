["06:42,140","06:47,140","\"As I opened the lid, the glass cracked and the hands utterly stopped.\""]

["07:07,140","07:09,140","\"Oh, wait, what?\""]
["07:09,140","07:14,680","\"Well, that's probably the combination of that lock. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. We just got to find out what the time is\""]
["07:14,680","07:19,000","\"Where's the time? There's something written on the wall over there. Really? Where? To the left?\""]

["07:23,260","07:25,940","\"What does that mean?\""]
["07:25,940","07:27,940","\"Maybe it might be very literal\""]
["07:27,940","07:30,700","\"probably\""]
["07:30,700","07:35,620","\"Okay, if a shadow tries to give you a hug say no bad touch\""]
["07:35,620","07:38,580","\"Call an adult\""]

["07:43,580","07:45,580","\"Why didn't they just let me die?\""]
["07:45,580","07:47,580","\"Probably to keep you alive if you dumb bitch.\""]

["07:50,580","07:52,580","\"Uh-uh.\""]

["08:46,920","08:49,300","\"Okay\""]
["08:49,300","08:56,380","\"Now we use the wrench. Oh, yeah, cuz there's no door knob. I guess that seems to be the case\""]
["08:56,380","09:00,180","\"I'm stupid. That's right. It can be modified\""]
["09:00,180","09:04,820","\"Yeah, this game wants to teach you how you can like open stuff in your inventory wait really\""]

["09:55,700","09:59,080","\"Smokey babies, but half is long. It's in here. Oh\""]
["10:01,200","10:06,960","\"Yeah, I guess the fact that it's all dynamic lighting means that they're not pre-rendered, huh?\""]
["10:06,960","10:10,120","\"I mean it's 3d look at that. Yeah, no, he definitely is 3d\""]

["10:39,480","10:40,480","\"Okay.\""]
["10:40,480","10:45,200","\"Uh, according to the latest archaeological discoveries on Winter Lake Island, the Tismet\""]
["10:45,200","10:50,160","\"tribe resided on the island for more than 500 years before being discovered by European\""]
["10:50,160","10:51,160","\"settlers.\""]
["10:51,160","10:55,480","\"Proof of this is an ancient underground cemetery found deep inside a cavern on the island,\""]
["10:55,480","10:57,360","\"sure dating from the 10th century.\""]
["10:57,360","10:58,360","\"Ooh.\""]
["10:58,360","11:00,700","\"and two hundred eighty six skeletons\""]
["11:00,700","11:02,700","\"two hundred eighty six\""]
["11:02,700","11:05,360","\"belonging only to ten year old children\""]
["11:05,360","11:08,320","\"have been an artist so far in the underground cemetery\""]
["11:08,320","11:10,120","\"all the bones were buried in pairs\""]
["11:10,120","11:13,000","\"and experts suspect that these were twins bring together\""]
["11:13,000","11:15,560","\"two hundred eighty six of us to get a lot of twins\""]
["11:15,560","11:19,720","\"that's a lot of two hundred forty three pairs of twins\""]
["11:19,720","11:21,800","\"it's kind of weird\""]
["11:21,800","11:24,200","\"kind of something weird happening\""]

["11:29,600","11:30,640","\"Have you ever heard of that?\""]
["11:30,640","11:31,760","\"No, it's a bullet.\""]
["11:31,760","11:35,520","\"So if you're like a burglar and you're escaping,\""]
["11:35,520","11:38,040","\"what a woman can do is she can birth twins\""]
["11:38,040","11:40,340","\"and throw them like a bullet to trip you.\""]
["11:40,340","11:43,760","\"But then afterwards, the twins have to be discarded.\""]
["11:43,760","11:45,200","\"So that's probably what was happening.\""]
["11:45,200","11:47,560","\"That was probably like their hunting method.\""]
