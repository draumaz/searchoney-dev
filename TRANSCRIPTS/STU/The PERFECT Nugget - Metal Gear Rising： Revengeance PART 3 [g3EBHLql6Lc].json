["00:10,500","00:14,700","\"Oh no! Oh god! What are these things called again, well?\""]
["00:14,700","00:16,800","\"Uh, Metal Gear... Cow.\""]
["00:16,800","00:23,900","\"Gecko's is what they're actually talking about. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Are they- are they originally from MGS4? Yeah, that's where they first show up. Yeah.\""]
["00:23,900","00:29,900","\"I remember there's goofy cow things. Remember they stepped on the box and then it was just watermelons, but then snake.\""]
["00:29,900","00:35,500","\"Snake was somewhere else being a chameleon and you cried.\""]
["00:35,500","00:36,500","\"I saw you.\""]
["00:36,500","00:40,580","\"How come they don't have Metal Gear Solid 4 on PC?\""]
["00:40,580","00:41,580","\"I don't know.\""]
["00:41,580","00:45,420","\"I know people hate it, but it's got moments in it that I really like.\""]
["00:45,420","00:48,420","\"Like I really liked that last fight with Ocelot.\""]
["00:48,420","00:51,900","\"I like had a save before it and I'd play it like all the time.\""]
["00:51,900","00:53,580","\"I never made it that far.\""]
["00:53,580","00:54,580","\"Oh yeah?\""]
["00:54,580","00:55,580","\"Yeah, I don't know.\""]
["00:55,580","00:58,780","\"I was not a big Metal Gear Solid 4 fan.\""]
["00:58,780","01:03,580","\"For people who enjoy it, all the Metal Gear's 4's is kinda like fan service.\""]
["01:03,580","01:07,660","\"It's a lot of self-referencing, but I don't know.\""]
["01:07,660","01:08,660","\"Oh, here we go.\""]
["01:08,660","01:13,980","\"I think when I was playing it, I was just a stage in my life where I was in no mood\""]
["01:13,980","01:14,980","\"for cutscenes.\""]
["01:14,980","01:18,020","\"Oh, well then that would be very bad.\""]
["01:18,020","01:21,580","\"Isn't that game like, it's got like a day of cutscenes or something?\""]
["01:21,580","01:26,500","\"Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, I skipped most of the Hell Carrier stuff after like a few minutes\""]
["01:26,500","01:27,500","\"of it.\""]
["01:27,500","01:28,500","\"Okay.\""]
["01:28,500","01:29,500","\"Oh my god.\""]
["01:29,500","01:30,500","\"No.\""]
["01:30,500","01:32,660","\"Don't let him do that.\""]
["01:32,660","01:36,340","\"The only one I really, really liked was probably three.\""]
["01:36,340","01:41,180","\"I know that two has become kind of like the popular hipster choice because it predicted\""]
["01:41,180","01:42,180","\"Twitter.\""]
["01:42,180","01:46,260","\"But I didn't really like that game much when I actually played it.\""]
["01:46,260","01:47,780","\"I guess I finished it.\""]
["01:47,780","01:48,780","\"Three.\""]
["01:48,780","01:54,220","\"I mean, the original one is still pretty nostalgic for me, but three, I think is the best of\""]
["01:54,220","01:56,420","\"the Metal Gear's.\""]
["01:56,420","01:59,580","\"I like it, I didn't like to at the time.\""]
["01:59,580","02:01,860","\"It was too young to even get it.\""]
["02:01,860","02:03,140","\"But knowing what it's all about,\""]
["02:03,140","02:04,380","\"I kinda think it's pretty cool.\""]
["02:04,380","02:08,500","\"It does cool things, but it's not like the most fun game.\""]
["02:08,500","02:11,620","\"- When it came out though, it fucking rocked.\""]
["02:11,620","02:12,440","\"- Did it?\""]
["02:12,440","02:14,020","\"- It was the coolest thing, yeah.\""]
["02:14,020","02:15,700","\"- People really hated riding.\""]
["02:15,700","02:18,300","\"- Yeah, no one's like, people were just upset\""]
["02:18,300","02:20,140","\"'cause they just wanted to be snake.\""]
["02:20,140","02:22,940","\"- But like all of the game mechanics are the exact same.\""]
["02:22,940","02:25,820","\"- Pretty much, except you have a cool sword at one point.\""]
["02:25,820","02:29,040","\"Oh my god, you cut him into little bits. Yeah\""]
["02:29,040","02:39,160","\"Dude this is fucking like half the phone calls I get now or just that just people calling fucking\""]
["02:39,160","02:44,800","\"No, I'm getting sick of these robot calls. Yeah, it's like three times three four fucking times a day\""]
["02:44,800","02:48,880","\"It's real bad. It's I feel like it's gotten so much worse in the last like two years\""]
["02:48,880","02:52,300","\"I'm almost tempted to just get rid of my phone at this point. It makes me so fucking angry\""]
["02:52,300","02:57,800","\"They wake me up nearly every fucking day it I have to like silence my phone and then if I do that\""]
["02:57,800","03:01,920","\"I can't hear my alarm, so I have to keep my phone on silence. It drives me fucking ballistic\""]
["03:01,920","03:07,060","\"I legitimately wish the people who did that got killed. I agree with you fucking scum\""]
["03:07,060","03:13,560","\"You know you can separately mute your ringer from your alarm. Well, I wish you fucking knew that before now\""]
["03:13,560","03:16,980","\"I wish I knew that before I put the hit squad on him, but you know\""]
["03:18,500","03:21,660","\"No, I agree. I I can't stand receiving\""]
["03:21,660","03:24,860","\"Robo calls when I'm sleeping. It's always this detour same\""]
["03:24,860","03:31,140","\"It's always like your student loan or your car insurance. Yeah, there is a warrant for your arrest\""]
["03:31,140","03:35,880","\"It'll be like right after the sun's come up so I can't fall back asleep after I fucking\""]
["03:35,880","03:39,780","\"Hang up on this douche and the worst part is sometimes. I'll say yes\""]
["03:39,780","03:42,740","\"I do want to talk so I want to fuck people and then they hang up instantly\""]
["03:45,380","03:48,380","\"That was me pressing the wrong direction.\""]
["03:48,380","03:54,580","\"I don't know why my brain intuitively thought to press like back instead of forward but\""]
["03:54,580","03:55,580","\"you know.\""]
["03:55,580","03:57,780","\"How come people are allowed to do those phone calls?\""]
["03:57,780","03:58,780","\"They're not.\""]
["03:58,780","04:00,780","\"They're not but I assume that they're like-\""]
["04:00,780","04:03,660","\"But the enforcement is not so great.\""]
["04:03,660","04:07,780","\"And I'm sure that they're not even like based out of the United States either.\""]
["04:07,780","04:09,940","\"Most of them are based somewhere in Asia.\""]
["04:09,940","04:10,940","\"No.\""]
["04:10,940","04:14,420","\"I remember one time when I was living at fucking elevate.\""]
["04:14,420","04:18,500","\"It was a, I was standing outside and I got one of those phone calls and I was just fucking\""]
["04:18,500","04:23,720","\"with him for like 10 minutes and then at the end of it, he finally caught on and he said\""]
["04:23,720","04:29,660","\"something like, \"\"You stupid bastard\"\" and I was just like, \"\"Whoa!\"\" and it got scary.\""]
["04:29,660","04:33,740","\"Yeah, those guys are always like really mean when they realize they're being fucked with,\""]
["04:33,740","04:35,740","\"even though they deserve it.\""]
["04:35,740","04:39,560","\"Isn't the motivation though, just to get you to say like simple things that they can\""]
["04:39,560","04:40,560","\"use?\""]
["04:40,560","04:42,540","\"Yes, yeah, once I learned that I stopped doing it.\""]
["04:42,540","04:44,540","\"You just said right there. Yeah\""]
["04:44,540","04:50,660","\"No, well once once I figured that out I stop I stopped doing my regular voice. Oh\""]
["04:50,660","04:54,860","\"Yeah, and just you do stupid ones. That's actually real smart\""]
["04:54,860","04:59,580","\"You know because they have those things that record your voice so that they can use it against you. Oh\""]
["04:59,580","05:04,860","\"Really? Yeah, so it let's say these guys call you up and you're just going like yeah\""]
["05:04,860","05:09,020","\"No, and then they'll take your voice clips and then they could like potentially do shit with that\""]
["05:09,020","05:14,240","\"I was like woken up out of it. Maybe that's why they call you really early in the morning\""]
["05:14,240","05:16,320","\"So that you're like groggy and your guard is down\""]
["05:16,320","05:23,080","\"Oh, I got one that was like pretending to be my water company and they were like on a scale of like one to ten\""]
["05:23,080","05:24,480","\"How would you rate our service?\""]
["05:24,480","05:28,420","\"And I like answered with like a number and then I he asked me like another question\""]
["05:28,420","05:32,760","\"I'm like wait a minute like this guy's trying to get me to say like every numerical\""]
["05:32,760","05:36,900","\"Thing in a line. Yeah, no, they're smart. Yeah\""]
["05:38,180","05:43,060","\"But if you put on a voice you're like, yeah, it is. I would like everything you are, for it.\""]
["05:43,060","05:50,040","\"Yeah, I did one where it was like one of those like your computer has a virus and you must give to me or computer\""]
["05:50,040","05:55,680","\"I will he was like trying to get me to do some kind of uh, what do you call it? A remote desktop thing?\""]
["05:55,680","06:02,740","\"I- that's a pretty common scam. Yeah, I was like, oh no the virus it's gotten stronger and I just started like screaming\""]
["06:02,740","06:04,740","\"I just went, fuck you and-\""]
["06:07,180","06:09,900","\"These fucking wastes of space. Yeah\""]
["06:09,900","06:12,780","\"fucking deserves it though\""]
["06:12,780","06:15,180","\"That guy probably makes like\""]
["06:15,180","06:17,540","\"Four cents an hour\""]
["06:17,540","06:20,780","\"Which I'm not even remotely sympathetic to because he's an asshole\""]
["06:20,780","06:27,100","\"You've you've heard some of those what's that guy's name that does a lot of the calls where he like he'll like waste like a\""]
["06:27,100","06:33,340","\"Half an hour and a half of those guys time. Yeah, Kit Boga. I've I've listened to a lot of his calls just like while I'm driving\""]
["06:33,860","06:38,860","\"It's pretty entertaining. He has like an old lady character. He likes to do a lot\""]
["06:38,860","06:46,100","\"Because old ladies are very popular targets. Oh, yeah, that's that's real smart ladies got a fall for that shit so much\""]
["06:46,100","06:47,340","\"Yeah\""]
["06:47,340","06:54,900","\"Apparently what started kiboga doing it was that his like some some person like robbed his grandmother of a bunch of money\""]
["06:54,900","06:59,860","\"And he's he's had like a vendetta against like Indian telemarketers ever since\""]
["07:00,020","07:04,100","\"They were saying about the guy who the guy called me like was one of the scammers\""]
["07:04,100","07:08,860","\"But I had an app on my phone at the time called Hia and sometimes I use higher\""]
["07:08,860","07:16,020","\"Right, so people sometimes people can call you and like a name will pop up and it will say who who exactly is calling you\""]
["07:16,020","07:18,140","\"Because someone has added it to the register. Mm-hmm\""]
["07:18,140","07:23,180","\"But someone called me they were scamming me and I just by chance said like like I looked at the name on the phone\""]
["07:23,180","07:28,420","\"And I was just like is this Mike Mike whatever and the guy was like what what?\""]

["07:40,620","07:42,620","\"After that though, it never worked again.\""]
["07:42,620","07:47,300","\"I like the idea of that guy like clenching up for like the whole week though, wondering\""]
["07:47,300","07:49,540","\"if you were going to come after him.\""]
