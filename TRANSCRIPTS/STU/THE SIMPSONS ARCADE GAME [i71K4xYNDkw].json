["22:42,660","22:45,100","\"Like I wonder if that's why smithers is evil\""]

["29:23,760","29:26,160","\"Yeah, what will it be called?\""]
["29:26,160","29:27,360","\"You should do...\""]
["29:27,360","29:28,760","\"What's the idea, are you?\""]
["29:28,760","29:29,840","\"You should create a thing called a tarmitz\""]
["29:29,840","29:32,840","\"where you baptize them in tar and they have to fight their way out.\""]
["29:32,840","29:35,480","\"Why would there be a baptism at a bar mitzvah, though?\""]

["29:37,880","29:38,840","\"Okay, fair enough.\""]
["29:38,840","29:40,640","\"You gotta make sure that they can get out of the tar pits\""]
["29:40,640","29:42,040","\"for when the second tarning happens.\""]
["29:42,040","29:43,920","\"It's your religion, so you can set up how you like.\""]
["29:43,920","29:47,200","\"So, instead of like, how old were you when you had your bar mitzvah?\""]
["29:47,200","29:47,880","\"13.\""]
["29:47,880","29:50,280","\"Okay, so instead, you can say you have your tarmitz\""]
["29:50,280","29:51,760","\"for when you're six.\""]
["29:51,760","29:58,020","\"And you have to go out into the tar pits, the steaming tar pits, and you have to dunk your kid down into it, like at least 10 feet.\""]
["29:58,020","30:01,060","\"You have to specifically go to the Lebrea tar pits.\""]
["30:01,060","30:02,760","\"And you can give them something to help them.\""]
["30:02,760","30:09,300","\"You have to make like a pre pilgrimage to LA before your final pilgrimage to Israel.\""]

["30:25,560","30:30,960","\"Why don't we just call the whole religion Tarmitzva and cut out the middleman of Judaism?\""]
["30:30,960","30:32,560","\"That's actually a good point because...\""]
["30:32,560","30:33,960","\"We should actually have a whole religion.\""]
["30:33,960","30:37,160","\"I feel like that would draw a less ire from the Jewish community.\""]
["30:37,160","30:39,160","\"Who cares? Who cares if you draw ire?\""]
["30:39,160","30:41,760","\"Your religion is new, it's bold, it's modern.\""]
["30:41,760","30:43,560","\"And...\""]
["30:43,560","30:47,560","\"And you can have extra long curly head curls in yours.\""]

["30:50,560","30:51,260","\"Yep.\""]
["30:51,260","30:54,960","\"I'm starting to maybe connect some dots that maybe this whole thing has been\""]

["30:56,360","30:58,060","\"You're maybe right.\""]
["30:58,060","30:59,260","\"It is the land of ire.\""]
["30:59,260","31:02,560","\"But to be fair, I think a religion centering around like getting out of\""]
["31:02,560","31:05,760","\"tar or like quicksand or something like that would probably be helpful\""]
["31:05,760","31:08,560","\"because imagine you're walking down the street all of a sudden you're on\""]
["31:08,560","31:11,660","\"quicksand if you don't have that preparation, you know, you're dead.\""]
