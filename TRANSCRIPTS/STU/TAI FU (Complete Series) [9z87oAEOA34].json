["06:22,440","06:25,560","\"There's a lot of blood in this game too.\""]
["06:25,560","06:28,560","\"Yeah DreamWorks was pretty edge at the time.\""]
["06:28,560","06:31,880","\"Yeah, like there's that whole spreading scene in Shurab.\""]
["06:31,880","06:36,960","\"Can we assume this is in universe and this is just this is like this is Kung Fu Panda's\""]
["06:36,960","06:42,760","\"world like way later when Ping actually is just the master of the temple.\""]
["06:42,760","06:44,960","\"He took over the land, turned into this.\""]
["06:44,960","06:50,640","\"Notice Tae-Fu have four nipples because he seems to have four packs with the music cut out\""]
["06:50,640","06:52,600","\"What the fuck?\""]
["06:52,600","06:54,040","\"Fuck you\""]
["06:54,040","06:56,120","\"That was just how it loops, I guess\""]

["07:00,040","07:03,000","\"Do you hear that?\""]
["07:03,000","07:05,000","\"Who was that?\""]
["07:05,000","07:13,200","\"Well, it's it's it's just music. Yeah, it's so pretty guy talking in Chinese. It's really scary\""]
["07:13,800","07:19,800","\"It's authentic. Hey, I love you can just do that. It's awesome. Can you do that to everything?\""]
["07:19,800","07:24,360","\"No, just smaller enemies. I think what do you think was walk cycle? It's a\""]
["07:24,360","07:28,160","\"Pretty fast\""]
["07:28,160","07:35,800","\"That was one out of two yeah, and that was two out of two good god you can do that\""]
["07:35,800","07:38,200","\"Let me go\""]
["07:38,200","07:40,520","\"There we go. Why does the music keep doing that?\""]
["07:41,200","07:46,620","\"Cuz it's gonna start anew. Oh, it doesn't loop. It just fades out and that's so shit\""]
["07:46,620","07:53,200","\"Yeah, they'd like whoever composed the music with no one explained to him that video game music has to loop\""]
["07:53,200","07:56,720","\"There's a bunch of old games that do that and it's like wow\""]
["07:56,720","08:00,260","\"Or maybe they did explain that news like I took some liberties\""]
["08:00,260","08:03,480","\"And gave it an outro. Oh\""]
["08:03,480","08:08,480","\"You know a lot of this game is also just like nonsensical spamming of bullshit\""]
["08:08,600","08:12,400","\"Like there's some fights that you're just met the spam and it's like designed around that I\""]
["08:12,400","08:16,880","\"Guess if that's a mechanic in the game you can do that\""]
["08:16,880","08:23,240","\"Maybe they just observe that was how everyone played it in the play testing so possible they leaned into it. I\""]
["08:23,240","08:25,840","\"Love you can do that\""]
["08:25,840","08:30,200","\"The fuck you no it seems like they're pretty liberal with the health\""]
["08:30,200","08:37,000","\"If it's really the green bar. Yeah, the first few levels are pretty okay. They're easy then it gets kind of scary\""]
["08:37,000","08:44,400","\"Fuck you. You really are like the apex predator of this world like nothing so far has been able to stand up to you\""]
["08:44,400","08:50,400","\"I don't actually just love look way cooler than everything else and what could stand up to a tiger anyway\""]
["08:50,400","08:54,000","\"Not really like a lion or a dragon\""]
["08:54,000","09:01,360","\"Is there any place where there's lions and tigers in the same ecosystem in the world zoo\""]
["09:01,360","09:05,200","\"Fair enough. That's why they make zoos Tomar\""]
["09:05,200","09:10,180","\"Yeah, so that they could see who would win in a fight that would make zoos way cooler. I agree dude\""]
["09:10,180","09:14,480","\"I was trying to find a video of just a gorilla fighting anything\""]
["09:14,480","09:19,720","\"Yeah, and like they they really don't like full-on like haymaker anybody\""]
["09:19,720","09:22,980","\"Yeah, the girls are nice and although they do is dragging you through the ditch a bit\""]
["09:22,980","09:26,900","\"It's a shame. They don't understand how cool they could be if you taught them how to box\""]
["09:26,900","09:33,520","\"Exactly, that's why I love them. They're just like big oafs. They're like hmm. There isn't this is not my observation\""]
["09:33,520","09:40,320","\"Servation by any means but like we've never seen a gorilla at maximum power because we've never taught one out of like lift weights\""]
["09:40,320","09:44,520","\"That's true, and they're still like all jacked\""]
["09:44,520","09:49,520","\"They just get that size from like eating a bunch of like fruit and wood\""]
["09:49,520","10:00,840","\"What you're right do they actually no you fucking they like leaves and bugs fruit and leaves and bugs\""]
["10:01,520","10:06,520","\"It's bananas. But the majority of their of their diet is like vegetarian, right?\""]
["10:06,520","10:08,520","\"Yeah\""]
["10:08,520","10:15,440","\"Wait, what that's shocking. There's a card in slot. Okay. We're look we're nine percent through the game. Oh, ready?\""]
["10:15,440","10:17,800","\"That doesn't sound right\""]
["10:17,800","10:20,120","\"Tomar gorillas eat each other\""]
["10:20,120","10:26,140","\"That's not true. That's baboons. Do they really those fucking psychos elite anything? Yeah, baboons are scary\""]
["10:26,160","10:30,520","\"- Swordchimp's, Chimps and Baboons suck, and McCocks also suck.\""]
["10:30,520","10:31,920","\"Honestly, we should get rid of all those\""]
["10:31,920","10:35,880","\"and just only keep Rangoutans and Silverbacks.\""]
["10:35,880","10:37,880","\"- And yeah, we should feed the other ones\""]
["10:37,880","10:39,040","\"to the Rangoutans. - I don't have Silverback\""]
["10:39,040","10:42,160","\"'cause it's just what a dominant male gorilla is.\""]
["10:42,160","10:45,800","\"Like a dominant Western Lola and gorilla as well.\""]
["10:45,800","10:49,160","\"- That's what I mean is Spartan Society of all Silverbacks.\""]
["10:49,160","10:51,160","\"- Yeah, let's start a new, and then we start cross-picking.\""]
["10:51,160","10:53,000","\"- Pretty good, we all just wanna kill each other.\""]
["10:53,000","10:55,280","\"- Yeah, but that would be awesome.\""]
["10:55,280","10:59,160","\"You need the like lesser gorillas and you obviously need female gorillas\""]

["11:15,920","11:17,920","\"It kinda, he should lose his snake card\""]
["11:17,920","11:21,440","\"This is before Adam and Eve got the arms removed\""]
["11:21,440","11:22,440","\"Yeah\""]

["44:17,860","44:24,180","\"I'm skilled. Do you have to use your magic on that or a leopard leap is a lamentable liability\""]

["44:37,420","44:46,860","\"Yeah, basic game design patterns say that this level should be easy to help you. Oh fuck really really admire your new powers\""]
["44:46,860","44:53,180","\"Oh, yeah, you can attack out of that. Yeah\""]
["44:54,540","44:59,000","\"What the fuck was that I don't know but he went Bowser, but I guess yet\""]

["45:09,240","45:17,040","\"You gotta hit again keep swacking it hacking it I think it hit it a couple of times during that fight so\""]
["45:17,040","45:19,680","\"bad\""]
["45:21,020","45:26,520","\"This like wide open level makes that really fun at least they considered that\""]
["45:26,520","45:29,680","\"Uh-huh, you can't see me, but I can see you\""]
["45:29,680","45:37,660","\"I liked it his stripes remain. That's a cool touch. That is cool. Oh\""]

["45:56,860","46:00,300","\"Take it back. Ah\""]

["46:07,460","46:14,420","\"Leave me alone. This is an open is an open world level. Oh my god the camera's changing\""]
["46:14,900","46:20,380","\"It's growing more mature with time probably looking for a way to rotate that platform\""]
["46:20,380","46:24,020","\"So to your right there that that little mountain zone here you go\""]
["46:24,020","46:29,240","\"This will let you rotate and then you got to go around and use that to get to the park which is hopefully the end\""]
["46:29,240","46:32,420","\"Man, that's actually a crazy little puzzle to put in\""]
["46:32,420","46:40,900","\"But we figured it out because we're smart as children in 1999. Yeah big brain kids\""]
["46:42,740","46:47,200","\"Now with the big brain kids now should be straight up, right? It should be to his left\""]
["46:47,200","46:52,340","\"Oh, no, no, yeah, Lyle's right. I don't know if he'll make that jump, but he could just try to leopard leap of faith\""]
["46:52,340","46:59,220","\"A wait a minute. Oh, I see what you're saying. It's the left here, right is it but but that's where it would be rotated\""]
["46:59,220","47:04,980","\"If it was the other way it's got see can you make it? I think you can make it. I believe in chris O'neo\""]
["47:04,980","47:08,660","\"Rotate\""]
["47:08,660","47:11,220","\"You're going the right way\""]
["47:12,180","47:15,200","\"Fucking legend the camera just kind of got me disoriented\""]
["47:15,200","47:22,640","\"There you go, okay halfway there\""]
["47:22,640","47:30,560","\"I mean, let me grab the coin. I was so fucking cool\""]
["47:30,560","47:36,360","\"Yeah, you actually did that was like you did better on that level than the last couple that level felt half as long\""]
["47:36,360","47:40,980","\"And I was gonna ask that earlier if the turn the leopard dash would make the levels feel way shorter now\""]
["47:41,120","47:43,720","\"Maybe or maybe it's always a possibility\""]
["47:43,720","47:52,120","\"Who know that was just them giving you an easier level to enjoy your new power and now it's gonna be back to a slog after this\""]
["47:52,120","47:54,320","\"Oh, I know is I love being Thai\""]
["47:54,320","48:00,440","\"I love being Thai food. So you're not being in this world your mantis one and leopard styles\""]
["48:00,440","48:10,200","\"Yeah, I want to see the other styles now so bad for this was the first time Pandora syndrome was observed in the human species\""]
["48:10,400","48:15,700","\"Yeah, I can't believe I don't live in a world as beautiful as that of typhoon. It's pretty beautiful\""]
["48:15,700","48:19,360","\"Mantis caves, but this wouldn't give you Pandora's syndrome\""]
["48:19,360","48:23,560","\"This would just make you assume this is what China's like and just make you want to move. Yeah\""]
["48:23,560","48:27,160","\"Join the Democratic People's Republic of China or whatever\""]
["48:27,160","48:35,600","\"Huh me sorry, I was like a magical wind chime that gives you your strength\""]

["52:23,640","52:28,920","\"heard of it. This seems like the kind of game that should have sequels. I feel like I've\""]

["52:34,760","52:38,040","\"This should have been the rough beginning and then it should have become like a fucking\""]
["52:38,040","52:42,560","\"masterpiece. Yeah, if I like the second or third one. Yeah. It's because DreamWorks\""]
["52:42,560","52:50,160","\"gave up on just making game stuff for anything other than their movie IPs. So was this pretty\""]
["52:50,160","52:58,000","\"Shrek when was Shrek? I'm pretty sure this is pretty Shrek. Shrek was probably like 2001 or\""]
["52:58,000","53:07,280","\"something. That sounds right. Shrek release date. Yeah April 22nd 2001. But I wonder how\""]
["53:07,280","53:11,360","\"long both of them were in development for. Their development may have overlapped a little bit.\""]
["53:11,360","53:17,200","\"So Shrek might have a little cameo appearance at the end of this? Yeah he will. That's not what I'm\""]

["01:16:58,200","01:17:04,240","\"He keeps the master, Fae-lu, in a gilded cage.\""]

["01:17:53,600","01:17:59,360","\"Yeah, but you didn't seem to get it so you didn't seem to let fly with the monkey bounce combo\""]

["01:18:28,580","01:18:34,000","\"Sure as hell try we didn't really have to do that actually yeah, you could have leopard leaps\""]
["01:18:34,000","01:18:40,840","\"Do not imply that the leopard leap and monkey roll are interchangeable. I'm not implying that\""]
["01:18:40,840","01:18:46,520","\"I'm just saying now that you have the monkey roll. Let's not forget about our good pal the leopard leap. Oh\""]
["01:18:46,520","01:18:52,360","\"Although functionally I don't see how they differ very much\""]
["01:18:52,360","01:18:57,080","\"Well one lets you bounce off of paper lanterns and the other one\""]
