["00:49,900","00:57,920","\"She and he's fighting zeed to save his girlfriend actually fighting the end. Yeah, now let me show you a little trick\""]
["00:57,920","01:02,840","\"Okay, this is cheating. We're not gonna actually do this. We're gonna play it the right way\""]
["01:02,840","01:08,580","\"But if you go into the options, yeah, she says sure you cans. Yeah, if you turn this down to zero\""]
["01:08,580","01:14,620","\"If you wait just a little bit see those two zeros. Yeah, watch what happens\""]
["01:14,620","01:18,040","\"Watch what happens to those two zero\""]
["01:23,440","01:28,420","\"So you can have infinite sure you can if you do that little trick, but we're not fucking loose\""]
["01:28,420","01:30,880","\"Yeah\""]
["01:50,680","01:55,960","\"Okay, I want to explain all the reasons why I love this game first. It's pretty apparent the music\""]

["02:26,360","02:32,900","\"And it feels really good like it's really clean. Yeah, this is what it was like on the the Sega on the Sega Genesis\""]
["02:32,900","02:38,880","\"On the six pack it was like this fucking clean. It was so good. Also these guys so\""]
["02:38,880","02:42,800","\"Chris is kind of like just fucking go. He's just he's just mauling through\""]
["02:42,800","02:47,260","\"Steamrolling. Okay, I lost my pal so you see when I picked up that powerbox\""]

["02:57,880","03:00,980","\"I didn't know I could lose any health every time I got me\""]
["03:00,980","03:05,120","\"I thought you were supposed to collect them. I always thought these fuckers look like the putties from Power Rangers\""]
["03:05,120","03:09,520","\"All right, so you should probably set your power to that explosion at the very end over there\""]
["03:09,520","03:12,520","\"No, I know you shouldn't really actually use that unless you're\""]
["03:13,340","03:18,620","\"Unless you have a one-up. Yeah, so okay. You got ninjitsu's you got you can do all sorts\""]

["04:02,580","04:06,000","\"Little bastard right here. It seems nice and responsive\""]
["04:06,000","04:10,860","\"It's really cool to how you can like duck and hit people with like shuriken's underneath when they're like blocking\""]
["04:10,860","04:14,240","\"Yeah, so you kind of like goat people into doing attacks and then you can like\""]

["04:47,020","04:53,100","\"This music is so fucking unbelievably godly\""]
["04:53,100","04:58,520","\"This game reminds me of another Sega Genesis game and people in the studio audience you could probably help me with this\""]
["04:58,520","05:00,940","\"I have fucking no idea what it's called\""]
["05:00,940","05:04,060","\"But you initially start out as like this time patrol guy\""]
["05:04,060","05:08,860","\"And you go back to like the medieval time and you're like mowing down people in the woods\""]
["05:08,860","05:16,940","\"Which eventually leads you to like a dungeon cavern type area where you battle a giant alien where you jump from wall to wall\""]
["05:16,940","05:20,300","\"While you shoot his big fucking alien heads you think about alien syndrome\""]
["05:20,300","05:26,180","\"I don't know what the fucking thing is all cheating Chris, but the next level you fight you go through a you go through a night\""]
["05:26,180","05:31,280","\"Like castle and then you battle this giant robot knight who like throws his fucking hand at you and then\""]
["05:32,020","05:36,960","\"It's a really good Sega Genesis game, but I don't know what it's called if anyone knows what it's called\""]
