["11:28,080","11:35,800","\"No, don't smoke don't smoke you're about to walk into this nice home. I cannot stand these people. You're gonna drag the smoke smell\""]
["11:35,800","11:38,400","\"You have to sing me a fucking one minute ago.\""]
["11:38,400","11:40,900","\"I am reading. You already told me at the end of the poem.\""]
["11:40,900","11:45,400","\"And as I already told you, Mr. Felton is no longer a patient at the same time.\""]
["11:45,400","11:46,600","\"I can't even go on to the room.\""]
["11:46,600","11:48,200","\"That is a hell of a door.\""]
["11:48,200","11:49,500","\"Outside the Institute.\""]
["11:49,500","11:51,100","\"So what do you want?\""]
["11:51,100","11:53,800","\"I am personally re-examining your case.\""]

["11:55,800","12:00,800","\"I strongly believe there are alternative ways and probably other experiments that are worth a try.\""]

["12:27,800","12:35,680","\"Oh, and please refrain from smoking inside. Mr. Falcon hates the smell of smoke. That's the scariest thing to a smoker\""]
["12:35,680","12:39,820","\"Is to not be able to smoke for 12 fucking minutes\""]
["12:39,820","12:43,280","\"Look at a little metronome\""]

["13:24,080","13:30,900","\"Holy good. No crashes again though. They say a remothered torment and wash your fucking hands of this game\""]
["13:30,900","13:36,580","\"Remothered tormented fathers in the hand is worth two in the bush. We can do this fate only roar\""]

["13:51,540","13:52,860","\"it seems.\""]
["13:52,860","13:53,940","\"- Nobody came.\""]
["13:53,940","13:55,740","\"- You used to be so fucking wholesome.\""]
["13:55,740","13:56,740","\"- Unreal four.\""]
["13:56,740","13:57,700","\"I know, right?\""]
["13:57,700","14:00,340","\"What happened?\""]
["14:00,340","14:03,140","\"- The Tomar that only came out when you used to drive\""]
["14:03,140","14:06,540","\"is now here to stay in this room with you.\""]
["14:06,540","14:07,380","\"- Yeah.\""]
["14:07,380","14:10,180","\"- Maybe if this game would stop tormenting my father.\""]
["14:10,180","14:11,820","\"- My father.\""]
["14:11,820","14:13,380","\"- Why is a mother?\""]
["14:13,380","14:14,220","\"- Her skin pours.\""]
["14:14,220","14:16,740","\"I just wanted to give her a nice little face mask\""]
["14:16,740","14:17,860","\"and whip that all over a little bit.\""]
["14:17,860","14:18,700","\"- All right.\""]
["14:18,700","14:20,620","\"Try to skip everything skippable.\""]
["14:20,620","14:22,140","\"- I did, I did that last time.\""]
["14:22,140","14:23,700","\"- Yeah, but now you can skip one more cutscene.\""]
["14:23,700","14:24,540","\"- Now you went harder.\""]
["14:24,540","14:25,900","\"- Oh, no.\""]
["14:25,900","14:27,980","\"- Why is P the Pause key?\""]
["14:27,980","14:30,820","\"- Because P for Pause is like literally\""]
["14:30,820","14:32,820","\"just think about it for one second.\""]
["14:32,820","14:34,340","\"- Yeah, I know it stands for Pause.\""]
["14:34,340","14:36,020","\"- But it's all the way over there.\""]
["14:36,020","14:37,020","\"It's all the way over there.\""]
["14:37,020","14:40,260","\"- Everyone uses escape as the Pause key or even tag.\""]
["14:40,260","14:41,780","\"- Why don't you just jump off a cliff\""]
["14:41,780","14:42,780","\"if everyone's doing it?\""]
["14:42,780","14:45,140","\"- There's no escape from this game\""]
["14:45,140","14:46,820","\"unless you fucking play a cutscene\""]
["14:46,820","14:47,980","\"and see a loading screen,\""]
["14:47,980","14:54,820","\"It's fucking over but yeah, God forbid we have the metronomic loading yeah the metronomic on you can summon the fucking metronomic\""]
["14:54,820","14:57,500","\"The demon of timing. What is this woman's name?\""]
["14:57,500","15:03,000","\"Do you want to watch this fucking cutscene long enough to find out I don't care\""]
["15:03,000","15:07,720","\"Yeah, they've already managed to not invest us in the early game\""]
["15:07,720","15:12,660","\"But but mid game mid game they might catch us back. I want to give them another chance\""]
["15:12,660","15:15,720","\"See that's when you want to get invested though when there's no not this way\""]
["15:16,740","15:18,740","\"Yeah straight left\""]
["15:18,740","15:24,380","\"Why would you want to go in the front door? I just thought maybe you have to trigger it first or some shit?\""]

["15:34,500","15:43,220","\"Like roses as much as the next guy, but what about when you grab them they prick you\""]
["15:44,100","15:46,380","\"It's like that song a prick from a rose\""]
["15:46,380","15:49,700","\"Rage a prick from a rose\""]
["15:49,700","15:52,820","\"Wait, what do we go? Oh, I want to look at that\""]
["15:52,820","16:01,660","\"She sees no Pinocchio's I think now that you've looked at that the game won't crash definitely\""]
["16:01,660","16:06,500","\"Horizon up there. I just want to look at the goods\""]
["16:06,500","16:11,100","\"What about the bads in the ugly\""]
["16:11,740","16:17,020","\"The bats the bats and the animals in the fucking clitoris. We can't even save\""]
