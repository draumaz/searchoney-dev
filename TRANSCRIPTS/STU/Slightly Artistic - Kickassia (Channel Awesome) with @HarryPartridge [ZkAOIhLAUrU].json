["06:30,720","06:32,720","\"He was dressed as Doctor Who.\""]
["06:32,720","06:38,060","\"And he was stood outside of the Lorian filming something and I walked past him and I was\""]

["06:39,060","06:40,820","\"He's doing a real Linkara thing.\""]
["06:40,820","06:46,260","\"He's dressed as a character from an old TV show and he's talking about time travel.\""]
["06:46,260","06:48,380","\"And I thought that isn't that nice.\""]
["06:48,380","06:50,060","\"I will say one thing.\""]

["07:13,420","07:19,340","\"Every time he goes to a convention, there are reports of...\""]
["07:19,340","07:22,780","\"I can't remember what this guy looks like. I'm trying to draw this poor, dug-and-guy.\""]
["07:22,780","07:27,020","\"Every time he goes to a convention, there are muggings that are prevented.\""]
["07:27,460","07:31,920","\"There are reports of a man that brings a tremendous amount of light to the seat of a crime\""]
["07:31,920","07:33,360","\"and scares criminals.\""]
["07:33,360","07:37,520","\"And I'm just saying that the minute an entire leaves town to go to a next convention,\""]
["07:37,520","07:39,420","\"the room is, you know, they die down.\""]
["07:39,420","07:39,940","\"Okay?\""]

["08:06,620","08:09,180","\"I wanted to I flirted with the idea\""]
["08:09,180","08:14,060","\"But all I uploaded was old videos like no reviews because I didn't do reviews and I thought I would all you know\""]
["08:14,060","08:20,840","\"I'll I'll warm people up to me with a couple of old videos and then I'll hit them with some new reviews and I try\""]
["08:20,840","08:25,880","\"I tried like filming some some movie reviews and some game reviews. I don't have what it takes to do reviews\""]
["08:25,880","08:29,160","\"It's really hard. It's really hard and I thought yeah, this isn't for me\""]
["08:29,160","08:34,240","\"So I pretty much uploaded about three things there and then never never did it again. How long were you?\""]
["08:34,240","08:36,980","\"Like listed like on the website\""]
["08:36,980","08:41,280","\"Do you remember when everyone was getting unlisted all in a row when the big document came out? Oh?\""]
["08:41,280","08:49,360","\"Yeah, I mean I had I was way gone by that point literally I uploaded I think 2011 and then that was it\""]
["08:49,360","08:54,360","\"I never uploaded after probably, you know, three times in 2011, so...\""]
["08:54,360","08:55,360","\"I feel you.\""]
["08:55,360","08:58,360","\"So I'm drawing Ben's eye here.\""]
["08:58,360","09:00,360","\"That looks just like him.\""]
["09:00,360","09:02,360","\"It's okay. It's alright. It's not great.\""]
["09:02,360","09:06,360","\"But he did fantastic game reviews in English.\""]
["09:06,360","09:11,360","\"Unfortunately, for me, at least anyway, Ben now does tons of reviews,\""]
["09:11,360","09:13,360","\"but they're all in French and he has a huge French following.\""]
["09:13,360","09:17,360","\"In fact, I will say that probably out of anyone, he's done really,\""]
["09:17,360","09:22,940","\"Like one of the best out of anybody from the that guy with the glasses crew and he's such a fucking stud love the guy\""]
["09:22,940","09:25,300","\"He's we work together a lot. He's great and\""]

["09:32,800","09:34,900","\"And I still work with him\""]
["09:34,900","09:40,180","\"So I am drawing him like a real human being and being as respectful and and awesome as I can beat him\""]
["09:40,180","09:44,300","\"Okay, well, I drew another Ben's eye right next to him, so\""]
["09:46,160","09:48,680","\"Jeez jeez Chris well there you go\""]
["09:48,680","10:03,000","\"That's bizarro benzai trying to corrupt the regular benzai\""]

["10:37,860","10:40,060","\"and\""]
["10:40,060","10:42,580","\"It's funny like when you do that you just kind of\""]
["10:43,300","10:48,060","\"It's not like you're watching them, but you're just kind of taking them in somehow and at the end of it\""]
["10:48,060","10:50,060","\"I felt like he was part of me, you know\""]
["10:50,060","10:55,420","\"The car became part of me that night that looks just like fail us dude. How did you do that?\""]
["10:55,420","10:59,780","\"Well, I'm drawing these two like human beings because I really like them a lot in real life\""]
