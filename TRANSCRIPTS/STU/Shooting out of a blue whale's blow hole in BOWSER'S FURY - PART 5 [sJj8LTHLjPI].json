["00:05,360","00:07,280","\"- Mom, mom, mom, mom! - Oh, we totally did that already.\""]
["00:07,280","00:12,200","\"How did I block that out? We definitely did that, like... in the last 10 minutes.\""]
["00:12,200","00:17,800","\"It's almost like when you're playing Mario, it's so mundane and easy, you kind of just forget what the f*ck you're doing.\""]
["00:17,800","00:19,400","\"You don't mean that.\""]
["00:19,400","00:24,640","\"Unless you do in which case erm oh no\""]
["00:24,640","00:27,320","\"Get it. Yeah\""]
["00:27,320","00:28,840","\"If I had like\""]
["00:28,840","00:35,120","\"Fifty trillion dollars I build that would you actually build stupid shit like this if you thought it was like funny\""]
["00:35,120","00:41,400","\"If I had a billion dollars, I would love to like I build a huge like a half pipe in the middle of the ocean\""]
["00:41,400","00:44,520","\"Big enough really blue whales to slide up and down\""]
["00:45,720","00:51,080","\"You build the world's first blue whale friend we have by it. That would be cool\""]
["00:51,080","00:53,880","\"You can get into its mouth and be like dude do us three six\""]
["00:53,880","00:57,840","\"Do we got a mad boy will and assuredly listen?\""]
["00:57,840","01:03,240","\"He's fucking flipping all over like a dolphin if I took myself into with blue whales blowhole\""]
["01:03,240","01:08,040","\"How far do you think you could shoot me? It would probably just split you in half honestly\""]
["01:08,040","01:13,720","\"You think I would just explode from the pressure I would hope those things are actually like they help people and shit\""]
["01:14,680","01:19,920","\"Yeah, well whales in general is a video of like this girl like drops her phone and the whale like\""]
["01:19,920","01:23,160","\"Goes down and gets it. That's nice of it\""]
["01:23,160","01:29,040","\"How can we haven't figured out like basic like convenient like flying and gliding yet?\""]
["01:29,040","01:35,940","\"It's fucking bullshit. You mean like is he is humans or humans? Yeah, just like eat simple personal flight devices\""]
["01:35,940","01:41,320","\"Yeah, like I know you can do that thing with the parachute in the motor, but that takes like a bunch of setup\""]
["01:42,200","01:48,720","\"Yeah, I think the whole thing is that anything that involves flying you run the risk of people just fucking like crashing and shit\""]
["01:48,720","01:49,840","\"Yeah, but it'd be funny\""]
["01:49,840","01:56,760","\"So like there there's probably there probably would be flying cars by now if it wasn't like a colossal safety issue\""]
["01:56,760","02:02,860","\"So we just need to find a way to nerf the hell out of them. You're you're way faster than me come here\""]
["02:02,860","02:05,960","\"Come here. Come here. Yeah fucking\""]
["02:05,960","02:10,280","\"Yes\""]
["02:10,280","02:12,480","\"But yeah, that would be sick to have a flying car\""]
["02:12,480","02:19,780","\"I would I would put up with like the the 50,000 in-air collisions a year just to live in a world where that's a thing\""]
["02:19,780","02:22,880","\"You'd think collisions would go down if we had\""]
["02:22,880","02:25,520","\"full use of the air but\""]
["02:25,520","02:31,520","\"But then you'd have issues where like you know like all collisions would happen like near landing points\""]
["02:31,520","02:35,460","\"I would think yeah or or people would like run out of gas and midair and then fall\""]
["02:35,460","02:38,600","\"10 seconds. I don't think you could do this\""]
["02:39,120","02:46,500","\"Well, you I do I do see Tomar is the one that you want to listen to because he's got a good gauge on speed\""]
["02:46,500","02:50,680","\"Well, you're actually like getting so much of these little red cats. It's really really cool\""]
["02:50,680","02:54,920","\"Yeah, I mean that's the idea right you want to collect as many as you can and then you know\""]
["02:54,920","03:03,280","\"Then you die and pass them on to your your assessors. Yeah, and then you murder your your your son's other father\""]
["03:03,280","03:05,280","\"Oh yeah, that's true.\""]
["03:05,280","03:06,280","\"Haha.\""]
["03:06,280","03:11,480","\"Alright, let's see.\""]
["03:11,480","03:12,480","\"Fuck those other fish up.\""]
["03:12,480","03:14,400","\"I'll get this like snowman thing.\""]
["03:14,400","03:16,400","\"Yes, sure.\""]
["03:16,400","03:17,400","\"Aha.\""]
["03:17,400","03:20,160","\"Now what?\""]
["03:20,160","03:22,480","\"There's a fish like down there somewhere.\""]
["03:22,480","03:23,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:23,480","03:24,480","\"Oh.\""]
["03:24,480","03:27,240","\"You little fucking asshole you thought you could.\""]
["03:27,240","03:30,120","\"The fish you thought he could.\""]
["03:30,120","03:35,080","\"the sequel to the brave little toaster and the little engine that could it's like\""]
["03:35,080","03:39,080","\"a cross over the fish who thought he could\""]
["03:39,080","03:44,840","\"the whole the whole story is about humility and a rangutan walks over\""]
["03:44,840","03:48,280","\"bites his head off\""]
["03:48,280","03:53,400","\"rangutans make really cool noises but dude they're they're neat looking animals\""]
["03:53,400","03:58,120","\"i saw a fucking video of like an orangutan where like some dude was like\""]
["03:58,120","04:05,680","\"like in like it you know you saw it in half no it was dude in like a fake orangutan costume\""]
["04:05,680","04:10,080","\"Yeah, and he was like he was like sawing mm, and the orangutan like\""]
["04:10,080","04:15,420","\"Saw him doing that and like figured out how to use a saw to like cut through a log\""]
["04:15,420","04:20,160","\"Yeah, that I have heard of yeah, they can definitely learn to use tools through\""]
["04:20,160","04:23,160","\"Just like seeing something and repeating it\""]
["04:23,160","04:26,640","\"Yeah, isn't there true after the stone age now\""]
["04:27,360","04:31,760","\"Wait, what do you mean like this chimp's that have started making like spears and tools out of life?\""]
["04:31,760","04:37,440","\"Yeah, cuz I think chips pass on knowledge in a way that's like not quite as like\""]
["04:37,440","04:44,120","\"competent as humans, but still like the closest thing we're aware of they should enter the future\""]
["04:44,120","04:51,160","\"Then it's a bit interesting things. It's almost always young chimps teaching older chimps\""]
["04:51,760","04:58,840","\"With what we've observed in nature really yeah, that's kind of like how we do with the computer with like nusta it is kind of oh\""]
["04:58,840","05:00,540","\"Fuck I don't know the story\""]
["05:00,540","05:05,220","\"So I'm not gonna try even to tell it but it's like it's that whole like hundred monkeys\""]
["05:05,220","05:10,300","\"Thing where like it wasn't actually the typewriter thing some no no no\""]
["05:10,300","05:12,560","\"It was just this idea\""]
["05:12,560","05:14,960","\"Like that there's like a critical mass where\""]
["05:14,960","05:21,060","\"Basically it was it was it was a pattern where they observed like that there were like monkeys in this series of like\""]
["05:21,060","05:23,700","\"islands in the Philippines or something or the younger\""]
["05:23,700","05:29,220","\"Monkeys were teaching the older monkeys to like wash their coconuts to like get a better like\""]
["05:29,220","05:37,260","\"Experience and then like and then like monkeys on other completely unrelated islands started doing it around the same like time\""]
["05:37,260","05:43,340","\"You are not fucking talking about ape telepathy right now. Are you? No, not not directly\""]
["05:43,340","05:49,380","\"I don't know indirectly. It's like a it's like it's not even like a thought experiment\""]
["05:49,380","05:52,700","\"It's not even the right word, but it's a thing that's like cited as like a...\""]
["05:52,700","05:56,780","\"I don't know. I don't want to get into the implications of the story because I don't...\""]
["05:56,780","05:58,780","\"No, because they're terrifying. No, I get it.\""]
["05:58,780","06:01,300","\"I don't want to turn this into like a philosophical thing.\""]
["06:01,300","06:02,280","\"But...\""]
["06:02,280","06:04,280","\"Turn it into a funny monkey thing instead.\""]
["06:04,280","06:05,880","\"I mean, that's the thing, right?\""]
["06:05,880","06:11,580","\"Is if you get 100 chimps on 100 typewriters, eventually one of them will write 1984.\""]
["06:11,580","06:15,080","\"That's... That was the idea, right?\""]
["06:15,080","06:17,580","\"Exactly. Yeah, that's what I was getting at.\""]
["06:17,980","06:21,100","\"But what is a chimps like version of 1984?\""]
["06:21,100","06:23,660","\"It's exactly what the regular one is.\""]
["06:23,660","06:24,660","\"But with monkeys.\""]
["06:24,660","06:26,100","\"But with monkeys.\""]
["06:26,100","06:32,240","\"I think what is the implication is that just like really really stupid or is the implication\""]
["06:32,240","06:35,500","\"that like if you leave something totally up to random enough times.\""]
["06:35,500","06:36,500","\"It'll probably just happen.\""]
["06:36,500","06:38,140","\"It'll probably happen eventually.\""]
["06:38,140","06:42,820","\"Like infinity is such a number that it will eventually like produce that result.\""]
["06:42,820","06:44,820","\"Pretty much.\""]
["06:44,820","06:47,540","\"Wow.\""]
["06:47,540","06:49,180","\"Another catch shot, another day.\""]
["06:49,180","06:52,340","\"Surprise surprise, another catch shot, another day.\""]
["06:52,340","06:54,440","\"That's still good over?\""]
["06:54,440","06:56,420","\"That's at the end of that shoe course.\""]
["06:56,420","06:59,580","\"We fucking beat the shit out of that shoe course.\""]
["06:59,580","07:01,460","\"Oh, but there's a little happy cloud.\""]
["07:01,460","07:03,500","\"Oh my God, I destroyed the dream.\""]
["07:03,500","07:04,500","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:04,500","07:06,220","\"And the family living beneath it.\""]
["07:06,220","07:07,900","\"I'm really hoping the Mario movies\""]
["07:07,900","07:09,980","\"like really, really bad.\""]
["07:09,980","07:10,980","\"You do?\""]
["07:10,980","07:12,660","\"'Cause I don't want it to be really good.\""]
["07:12,660","07:13,500","\"I don't know why.\""]
["07:13,500","07:15,300","\"I don't want a Mario movie to ever be good.\""]
["07:15,300","07:17,060","\"And that's purely selfish.\""]
["07:17,060","07:19,060","\"Why don't you want it to be good?\""]
["07:19,060","07:24,960","\"Because a good Mario movie will just be like the beginning of the end. It's like okay\""]
["07:24,960","07:27,460","\"It was it was a good Mario. It's kind of like I don't know\""]
["07:27,460","07:32,580","\"I wish the Sonic movie was way more cringy than it was. Oh was I supposed to kill all those apparently?\""]
["07:32,580","07:35,940","\"Wouldn't you prefer the Sonic movie to be like way more in Madison?\""]
["07:35,940","07:42,120","\"Absolutely, but because it was just boring honestly. I don't think I don't think Mario is that kind of character though\""]
["07:42,120","07:46,880","\"I definitely don't want to see Mario like go on a road trip with George Lopez or whatever, but\""]
["07:46,880","07:52,280","\"Sure it's Lopez. I want the new Mario movie to learn nothing from the old Mario movie\""]
["07:52,280","07:56,580","\"So they just remake the new the old Mario movie, but with like CG models\""]
["07:56,580","07:59,440","\"Yeah, I want it to be like like Blade Runner fucking\""]
["07:59,440","08:02,000","\"24/7 or whatever but with\""]
["08:02,000","08:05,100","\"Can you imagine how fucking mad people would be you already got this? Oh?\""]
["08:05,100","08:09,960","\"Man, I really got to keep track of what we have and don't have we only need three more\""]
["08:09,960","08:13,200","\"How could you even tell that you'd already gotten that I don't know?\""]
["08:13,200","08:19,820","\"There's like a map there's like a mapper uni yeah, okay mapper uni and she is we have not been over here yet\""]
["08:19,820","08:24,260","\"Which is like is that that's way the fuck out there, but you know what this guy's fast\""]
["08:24,260","08:34,240","\"He learns fast. He is quick. He's quick with it. He's sterile. He is sterile. You have to admit he's a little more sterile than most\""]
["08:34,240","08:35,440","\"I\""]
["08:35,440","08:40,180","\"Want to run a knife through his back and see what happens you want to run it down in spine and see if you get\""]
["08:40,180","08:44,940","\"I just want to cut I want to cut him up a bit. I want to know how he ticks, you know\""]
["08:44,940","08:50,840","\"I guess that's fair. Oh that that fucking right. It's glowing. Is that a new one or an old one?\""]
["08:50,840","08:54,700","\"Fuck you could be a rabbit\""]
["08:54,700","08:58,740","\"Yeah, we haven't done this one yet. This one's new\""]
["09:05,700","09:11,360","\"Well you smashed me so I guess I'll pay you I want to just relax inside of this hot spring\""]
["09:11,360","09:14,300","\"You're only two cat shines away\""]
["09:14,300","09:17,460","\"From your next showdown with the bowman\""]
["09:17,460","09:21,940","\"So what you really want the Iceland and we were sitting next to each other in the hot spring and then all the water\""]
["09:21,940","09:26,420","\"Got really brown around you and you got up and laughed then we didn't see you for the rest of the week\""]
["09:26,420","09:32,180","\"I mean I know I don't remember that. I don't know you're talking about\""]
["09:34,580","09:42,700","\"Still want to go to Iceland really bad even after that hypothetical scenario that you laid out even after the iceland the Iceland brown\""]
["09:42,700","09:45,580","\"Prophecy I still want to do it. Yeah\""]
["09:45,580","09:51,140","\"Is Iceland actually good place to go to hot springs. Yeah, that's the whole point. Oh, yeah\""]
["09:51,140","09:55,620","\"I want to do that the world's dankest hot spring is there. Oh shit. Oh\""]
["09:55,620","10:02,700","\"Bad, I don't know if that was how I supposed to do that. He killed the thing. He's back. He seems fine with that\""]
["10:03,180","10:08,420","\"He's waiting for you. He's got a chuckle on his face. Yeah, he's smiling. He liked that I did that\""]
["10:08,420","10:13,140","\"Okay\""]
["10:13,140","10:15,620","\"Shining on a hidden aisle\""]
["10:15,620","10:19,140","\"Alright, I think we only need one more of these you know\""]
["10:19,140","10:24,020","\"I think when we beat this game people will actually take back all the meat things they said no no say we're good at this game\""]
["10:24,020","10:26,020","\"I think so too\""]
["10:26,020","10:26,580","\"I\""]
["10:26,580","10:29,620","\"Think they'll say that was the most masterful Mario\""]
["10:29,620","10:35,860","\"I just think we're gonna have to take a small break for Mario for the next for the next season. What do you mean?\""]
["10:35,860","10:37,460","\"I\""]
["10:37,460","10:42,900","\"Think we're gonna we're gonna really show everybody unless we're gonna play Mario RPG\""]
["10:42,900","10:50,060","\"We should play Mario RPG. I've always meant to play it. Is it good? Is it really good? Is it really fucking ugly?\""]
["10:50,060","10:52,060","\"What it is\""]
["10:53,380","11:00,100","\"I like paper Mario a lot like the the thousand-year door especially. I don't know if it would be like a good like\""]
["11:00,100","11:05,260","\"Let's play game especially because we have a tendency to like not really read\""]
["11:05,260","11:09,660","\"Just not not like I'd read it if I can't text of games\""]
["11:09,660","11:17,300","\"Oh my god. I didn't even fucking see that did I did I grandpa and you into that no that was that was all me\""]
["11:17,860","11:24,000","\"Don't you fucking dare take credit for ending the big man himself. I did groundpad right as it happened\""]
["11:24,000","11:29,800","\"That's the first time I ever saw the little sprite version of your of your little dino friend\""]
["11:29,800","11:36,200","\"What would you do if you were a ghost right and you got murdered by like a really really buff guy like you gave this dude like a\""]
["11:36,200","11:40,640","\"Crazy fight it was like fucking it was like some like giant like\""]
["11:40,640","11:45,640","\"Dwayne the Rock Johnson size dude and you like you like almost beat him in a fight\""]
["11:45,640","11:51,440","\"But then he killed you and you were like a ghost you became a ghost because of your regret of not being able to beat\""]
["11:51,440","11:55,020","\"Yeah, and then you were watching them investigate your murder and\""]
["11:55,020","11:59,980","\"They have the police lineup and they pick out like this scrawny like\""]
["11:59,980","12:04,800","\"Bitch of a dude and we're like oh yeah, that's the that's the guy that punched him to death\""]
["12:04,800","12:07,320","\"It's that guy that little scrawny bitch guy\""]
["12:07,320","12:11,040","\"Would you be like an angry ghost would you haunt those detectives?\""]
["12:12,360","12:16,160","\"I feel like if I was a ghost I'd fuck around with it literally everyone possible\""]
["12:16,160","12:20,460","\"What wouldn't you what else are you gonna do fuck with them specifically? Yeah?\""]
["12:20,460","12:24,200","\"Would you fuck with them like earlier than you normally would have fucked with them?\""]
["12:24,200","12:31,800","\"Like if they were like yeah, this guy with like the limp wrists like he beat the crap out of Chris and Chris was helpless to defend himself\""]
["12:31,800","12:36,020","\"Yeah, I'd like I'd possess them and then like make them eat shit\""]
["12:36,020","12:40,200","\"You'd possess them and have them right in the report actually Chris lifted a lot of weights\""]
["12:40,200","12:46,440","\"He's doing real good. I definitely wasted my time in the afterlife to do that\""]
["12:46,440","12:51,840","\"I would want people to know like if someone killed me like he had to be like a real jacked, you know\""]
["12:51,840","12:56,840","\"Oh, Bazz was coming out. Oh, your greatest week misses your lack of depth percent. There is\""]
["12:56,840","13:02,600","\"I don't know how I'm supposed to get up here. You got to get on top of that thing there before it turns\""]
["13:02,600","13:05,920","\"Yeah, run along. There you did it. You did it. You did it. Ah\""]
["13:06,640","13:13,320","\"Yeah, I want to be like I want to be like exactly center between two black holes you get ripped apart by them both right?\""]

["15:39,620","15:43,140","\"That's probably also something that I need Bowser to wake up to do\""]
["15:43,140","15:47,960","\"Because the fury there's like Bowser blocks that only Bowser can break\""]

["16:21,500","16:23,500","\"I'd be inclined to agree.\""]
["16:23,500","16:27,500","\"I wish they had a gong with literally anything else.\""]
["16:27,500","16:28,500","\"It's so stupid looking.\""]
["16:28,500","16:30,500","\"Yeah, I don't know why they made him a cat.\""]
["16:30,500","16:33,500","\"I would have honestly just taken regular ass like Super Saiyan Mario.\""]
["16:33,500","16:36,500","\"I'd given him like super cool skin pores and super cool stubble.\""]

["17:05,500","17:12,900","\"Hit him in the chest while he's roaring. No, that doesn't work. We definitely try to do that and it was absolutely ridiculous.\""]
["17:12,900","17:15,900","\"It was absolutely fabulous. Are we sure that this will work? Wait, I don't...\""]
["17:16,500","17:23,080","\"Let me see I think I think this will work throwing that at him or he would fucking hate if I did that watch out\""]
