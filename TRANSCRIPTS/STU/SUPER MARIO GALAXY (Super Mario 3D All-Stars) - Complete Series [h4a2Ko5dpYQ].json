["02:51,320","02:55,320","\"Yeah, yeah, you can just grab those right out the sky\""]
["02:55,320","03:00,960","\"Apparently you can give someone else the second controller to be the stupid wiggly star thing\""]

["03:05,200","03:09,880","\"Okay, because the second player can make you like double jump and then fire all your coins away\""]
["03:09,880","03:15,720","\"This is a video rip straight from the Wii rip straight from the heart. Oh\""]
["03:15,720","03:16,220","\"Aw.\""]
["03:16,220","03:22,320","\"I did like this callback to Mario 3 with the airships and all.\""]

["03:43,060","03:48,880","\"Yeah, obviously it was a scheme. Everybody involved thought that they were composing for the war.\""]
["03:48,880","03:50,160","\"So this is a real motor.\""]
["03:50,160","03:52,680","\"Holding these blades of grass, he's blowing into them.\""]
["03:52,680","03:55,000","\"You just lower the pitch, add some reverb, voila.\""]
["03:55,000","03:55,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:55,480","04:01,840","\"This was just Miyamoto tending to his garden and finding some extra time to record the soundtrack.\""]
["04:01,840","04:05,920","\"He thought he was alone and then a wata popped out of the bush as God rest his soul and said,\""]
["04:05,920","04:08,080","\"\"\"I got the door right away!\"\"\""]
["04:08,080","04:11,840","\"[laughter]\""]
["04:11,840","04:13,840","\"\"\"Well, well, well, how?\"\"\""]
["04:13,840","04:18,340","\"I'd kill Peach too, honestly.\""]
["04:18,340","04:20,240","\"'Cause you can't have her.\""]
["04:20,240","04:21,840","\"Is he doing that to kill her?\""]
["04:21,840","04:22,840","\"I hope.\""]
["04:22,840","04:25,340","\"Well, how did Bowser get a fucking spirit bomb?\""]
["04:25,340","04:29,840","\"Look, she keeps children in her castle and fucking ghosts in her eye.\""]

["04:51,000","04:56,120","\"Tired of his shit the princess, okay\""]
["04:57,640","05:03,720","\"I uh, so I never like played through this played through this because uh, this is my first time ever\""]
["05:03,720","05:09,040","\"I played it once at a friend's house, but at the time it came out. I was just so tired of the we\""]
["05:09,040","05:11,620","\"Just cuz that controller sucks\""]
["05:11,620","05:17,020","\"Yeah, is that a controversial opinion in this day and age that that controller kind of didn't work?\""]
["05:17,020","05:22,040","\"Uh, I don't know. I remember when the Wii motion plus came out everyone stopped saying that. Oh, yeah\""]
["05:22,040","05:29,120","\"Well, this was before that wasn't it? I never like holding that stupid square also the Wii motion plus anybody who played skyward sword\""]
["05:29,120","05:34,800","\"Can attest that that thing didn't really work either. Yeah, but I just remember at this point like I was\""]
["05:34,800","05:40,000","\"Boy-codding is maybe too strong of a word, but just tired of playing the Wii\""]
["05:40,000","05:46,600","\"So if a game came out for it, and I didn't like absolutely need it. I was just like fuck it. Yeah\""]
["05:47,960","05:53,800","\"I remember I was so fucking disappointed when I played the Zelda on the Wii. What was it Twilight Princess?\""]
["05:53,800","05:59,920","\"Yeah, it basically just replaced the B button with any discernible movement of your arm hated it\""]
["05:59,920","06:03,400","\"There are a lot of games that did that were the the Wii\""]
["06:03,400","06:07,680","\"Motion thing it was literally just that instead of a button\""]
["06:07,680","06:13,200","\"So he just steals the whole thing this time, huh? If he's got the resources, I mean why not I?\""]
["06:13,720","06:19,660","\"I'd assume no even if you did have the resources it would always take less resources just to grab the person out\""]
["06:19,660","06:27,060","\"But this is cooler right and he's got aliens helping if you were like one of those billionaires yet unlimited money and aliens\""]
["06:27,060","06:30,980","\"If you want to fuck with somebody you might as well do it in this way possible\""]
["06:30,980","06:34,180","\"Start building pyramids on their property\""]
["06:34,180","06:41,140","\"Like how would you fuck with someone if you had unlimited money if you could like buy all the houses around them like\""]
["06:41,260","06:47,980","\"Unbeknownst to them and higher actors as their neighbors. That would be so fucking cool. You can get away with so much horrible shit\""]
["06:47,980","06:50,640","\"That's technically not illegal. I don't think I\""]
["06:50,640","06:57,220","\"Think it'd be cool if you could like make a ring of statues of the person of them all fucking themselves in the ass\""]
["06:57,220","06:58,220","\"So we can't escape\""]
["06:58,220","07:00,780","\"They have to look at a ring of himself fucking himself in the ass\""]
["07:00,780","07:04,300","\"what if you got actors to move in around them and\""]
["07:04,860","07:08,940","\"paid the actors to get plastic surgery to look exactly like them and\""]
["07:08,940","07:12,900","\"Just slowly move them in over the course of like a year or two. I\""]
["07:12,900","07:17,360","\"Would be frightened like imagine that shit. That'd be horrifying\""]
["07:17,360","07:22,500","\"And they're all like they all say that they have your job and do the same shit you do\""]
["07:22,500","07:28,860","\"They all have the same wife. Oh my name's Chris - that's so weird. I'm also a youtuber\""]
["07:28,860","07:33,020","\"That's so sick and then they like pay for bots to have the same amount of subscribers. I\""]
["07:33,580","07:39,160","\"Hate this fucking rabbit. Well, he's your responsibility your last chance to demolish him\""]
["07:39,160","07:43,120","\"This is your last chance to throw him into the vacuum of space\""]
["07:43,120","07:48,860","\"Me a motor used to chase a rabbit around his house and grab it\""]
["07:48,860","07:52,680","\"Yeah, he said that he got the idea for Mario after smashing a rabbit\""]
["07:52,680","08:02,520","\"You said he put nails in each of its ears and crucified it on a little on a little baseboard\""]
["08:03,100","08:08,160","\"This really was the big gimmick of this game was just the the wrapping levels, right?\""]
["08:08,160","08:16,260","\"Yes, I just feel like I'm gonna be sick sometimes just looking at it. Well, I see your point, but also it's kind of stupid\""]
["08:16,260","08:18,900","\"Yeah, you're not actually a game designer\""]
["08:18,900","08:24,340","\"You can't have an opinion on something unless you are the job of which you want to have the opinion off\""]
["08:24,340","08:29,980","\"Also, if you think you can make a better game the Mario just all by yourself. Why don't you why haven't you done it?\""]
["08:29,980","08:32,180","\"I'm just talking about Mario Galaxy.\""]
["08:32,180","08:35,380","\"Oh, so if it's just Mario Galaxy, you could make a better game.\""]
["08:35,380","08:37,100","\"You could make a better game.\""]
["08:37,100","08:38,460","\"I'm not saying that.\""]
["08:38,460","08:41,900","\"Yeah, you're saying something and I'm still trying to parse what.\""]
["08:41,900","08:43,540","\"Did you own that guy now?\""]
["08:43,540","08:45,580","\"Does he have to do everything you say?\""]
["08:45,580","08:47,340","\"He's my star child, so yeah.\""]
["08:47,340","08:53,340","\"Yeah, I basically have full custody and I get child support for him.\""]
["08:53,340","08:55,500","\"Oh, crop circles, crop stars.\""]
["08:55,500","08:56,500","\"What?\""]
["08:56,500","08:59,420","\"Oh, yeah, there's like stars shaped like.\""]
["08:59,620","09:07,480","\"Yeah, did stars did aliens carve little star men into the planet because they were being dicks that that rabbit had a beacon on his skull\""]
["09:07,480","09:11,580","\"Come here you how do I just run into them? I thought there was a grab button\""]
["09:11,580","09:17,440","\"Should have hidden the grass is that like a tip I?\""]
["09:17,440","09:23,340","\"Think that guy's just lamenting his poor choices in life. This is where that's that yeah, there it is\""]
["09:23,340","09:29,440","\"He's he's out. He's out. He's about fucking kill him come here stupid. I think you can lunge at him too\""]
["09:29,440","09:35,440","\"I thought so all the controls are confusing. They're still like a Z jump like in Mario 64\""]
["09:35,440","09:40,300","\"Mario can lunge at him bearing his teeth for if you crouch right before you jump or something\""]
["09:40,300","09:45,840","\"Yeah, you know if you flip a rabbit on its back too fast. It can have a heart attack and die. Is that real?\""]
["09:45,840","09:51,180","\"Yeah, I've never heard that so Mario is actually putting these things at risk by grabbing them like that\""]
["09:51,180","09:55,800","\"There's definitely certain creatures we live with in the modern day that like they should be dead\""]
["09:56,040","10:02,120","\"They should be extinct rabbits aren't extinct just because they multiply so much same thing with rats and shit\""]
["10:02,120","10:07,280","\"Yeah, they're they're rate of breeding mix up for all their other evolutionary shortcomings\""]
["10:07,280","10:23,240","\"Star leaner star leans a good name why'd they call her star lean star away? Yeah, I would have been okay\""]
["10:25,320","10:29,540","\"Did he just swallow that Mario looks fucking fat in this game I?\""]
["10:29,540","10:32,800","\"Feed you my children\""]
["10:32,800","10:35,240","\"Goodbye I\""]
["10:35,240","10:41,760","\"Like the way everything in this game has like the outer lines. I mean the outer brightness rim lighting looks cool\""]
["10:41,760","10:45,560","\"It helps you pop out from the starry sky. Oh\""]
["10:45,560","10:53,240","\"Yeah, do you think that's a real lighting effect or no? It's a shader thing. Yeah, it's definitely a shader cheat because it\""]
["10:53,800","11:00,240","\"It's on like everything but a lot of shader cheats look really good. See I don't have a joy con so I'm getting confused\""]
["11:00,240","11:05,640","\"See you can troll or we can also press why I think I hate having to do this shit. I'm why?\""]
["11:05,640","11:12,640","\"Okay, yeah, yeah, just do it. Yeah, okay good. That's actually very good. I freaking hate moving\""]
["11:12,640","11:15,480","\"I hate activity\""]
["11:22,880","11:25,560","\"Go on shake and press what okay\""]
["11:25,560","11:28,880","\"Oh\""]
["11:28,880","11:30,880","\"You missed\""]
["11:30,880","11:40,060","\"Another game's good now that the music's kicked in just imagine him talking sinking up to the music find all the star chips\""]
["11:40,060","11:43,460","\"Okay, there's a chip. I found one\""]
["11:43,460","11:46,080","\"Thanks to a mark. Ah\""]
["11:46,080","11:46,600","\"Oh\""]
["11:46,600","11:49,240","\"Goombas look fucking fat as hell in this little weird. Oh\""]
["11:50,480","11:56,800","\"Their game cut out sorry someone messaged the CEO Velgato and be like WTF bra what is up with you lately?\""]
["11:56,800","11:58,800","\"And why is it just called the cat?\""]
["11:58,800","12:04,640","\"Just check in on him. You know what? I'm kind on your side. I kind of don't like the disorientate\""]
["12:04,640","12:11,160","\"I don't like running around these planets. It's a neat gimmick, but it quickly becomes just that\""]
["12:11,160","12:15,320","\"It's like I don't know how I feel about it like in hindsight\""]
["12:15,320","12:20,120","\"I haven't seen enough of it to really have an opinion on it so far. I think it's fine\""]
["12:20,120","12:27,160","\"But well, well is right dude. I complain pretty much from the get go. That's kind of lame actually Tomar started it\""]
["12:27,160","12:29,160","\"I'm gonna get a kind of negative\""]
["12:29,160","12:32,620","\"Toxid you if anything or the poison pill of only place\""]
["12:32,620","12:39,000","\"You put these horrible thoughts in our head it's not good enough\""]

["13:03,080","13:08,320","\"I don't think that's true at all. I'll add to the elephant. Oh, it's just a little too much going on dude\""]
["13:08,320","13:10,420","\"It's just a little too good\""]
["13:10,420","13:15,640","\"What do I think Mario? I think bad what happened to the classic?\""]

["25:53,920","25:58,480","\"Like the process in which this came to be I can probably want to attack its tail ball\""]

["26:26,660","26:32,160","\"Yeah, I mean this is essentially just clubbing a baby seal at this point. I think that's fine\""]
["26:32,160","26:36,020","\"Yeah, but you're not even getting a coat out of it. I actually I don't know what Mario's gonna do with it\""]

["26:58,440","27:06,320","\"That moment when you get home from a long day and work and you just lie on your bed and you fall asleep\""]
["27:06,320","27:12,200","\"And you burst into a star wait, that's a that's a regular star. Oh, yeah\""]
["27:12,200","27:16,200","\"They're just regular stars. That's some Pluto goofy shit\""]
["27:17,640","27:25,920","\"In a world full of like sentient stars, they're still object stars with eyes that look almost exactly like like the sentient ones\""]

["27:46,360","27:52,480","\"That might be what what goofy sees in like Pluto or it's just like it's got resemblance to me, but\""]
["27:52,480","28:02,980","\"Slavery's good if you're getting a good result. I'm just saying the pyramids couldn't have gotten done otherwise\""]

["28:54,520","29:02,320","\"Audio sensory meridian response. I think that it's some made-up crap like ASMR is like definitely a real phenomenon\""]

["29:06,560","29:12,160","\"And I think a lot of people are just jacking off to it. Yeah, I don't look down upon it or anything\""]
["29:12,160","29:18,800","\"But the community is weird to me. I was gonna say I inherently get cringe from it like it's it's the most\""]

["29:37,740","29:45,520","\"Yeah, I don't know. I don't even know what it is. I feel like a lot of it is just like borderline porn\""]

["29:52,780","29:54,780","\"It's all just about the actual like\""]
["29:54,780","30:03,280","\"the the audio like it's more about the technical qualities of the audio than about any of the content of what's being done or said or\""]

["37:40,900","37:41,900","\"Why?\""]
["37:41,900","37:44,860","\"Because they fucking fold space time toward themselves.\""]

["46:05,340","46:08,540","\"Okay, so Bob Hoskins, Mario.\""]
["46:08,540","46:09,740","\"Imagine that's the new game.\""]

["46:45,400","46:51,820","\"There's there's some things that are too stupid, but besides that I think it's like a fun little location and everything's all fucked up\""]
["46:52,300","46:59,500","\"Well, you didn't like the fungus. Okay, so do you want to try getting a little bit of context is I didn't know that the Mario movie\""]

["47:15,240","47:20,580","\"I think most people in our demographic know it a blockbuster. Okay fair, but anyway\""]
["47:21,260","47:25,700","\"They would just put the VHS's in these kind of unmarked things\""]
["47:25,700","47:30,260","\"That would just say the title of the movie and just have like a little blockbuster logo\""]
["47:30,260","47:34,480","\"So you had no idea what the contents of the movie actually were past the title\""]
["47:34,480","47:36,500","\"So I saw Super Mario Brothers\""]
["47:36,500","47:42,900","\"I expected it to kind of like you know look like this and then it was like just this weird fucking Blade Runner movie\""]
["47:42,900","47:49,740","\"It's funnier than it was. I was like three or four. So it kind of like super upset me. I was like what the fuck is this?\""]

["48:45,620","48:48,180","\"- I think that, yeah, the Crusades were actually waged\""]
["48:48,180","48:49,940","\"over a similar scenario.\""]
["48:49,940","48:52,620","\"Yeah, where Mario said to like the Pope something\""]

["58:24,340","58:29,620","\"There's no stars left in the dark. Exactly on time. It would just be like oh, yeah, that's just a cork wax did that\""]

["58:33,260","58:35,980","\"I don't know at least for artistic stuff\""]

["58:43,020","58:47,540","\"They knew how to throw in the human errors that were just but they weren't so bad that they ruined it\""]
["58:47,540","58:50,580","\"I mean at that point then it would then it might just be like weird\""]
