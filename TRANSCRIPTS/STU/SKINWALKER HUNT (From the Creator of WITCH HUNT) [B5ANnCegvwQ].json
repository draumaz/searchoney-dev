A couple of weeks ago mutilated bodies of terrorists were found in a long-lived valley. There were also reports that local animals became very aggressive. And some people say they're strange animal roars at night. Those are clear signs of skin loss. And those animals are probably in the gee-foolies of skin loss.\""]
["00:56,000","01:00,420","\"owners of that bland became desperate and hired me to let me down.\""]

["15:19,060","15:20,940","\"Honestly, I'd be playing this game by the edge.\""]
