["06:51,740","06:52,780","\"and turned in blue.\""]
["06:52,780","06:55,100","\"And that's one of the reasons why he becomes super Sonic\""]

["17:46,860","17:47,980","\"'cause I was a bit on \"\"Tangent\"\"\""]
["17:47,980","17:51,620","\"but like old McDonald's toys were really well made.\""]
["17:51,620","17:53,780","\"They were like straight up toys that you could buy\""]
["17:53,780","17:54,980","\"in like a little plastic thing\""]
["17:54,980","17:56,300","\"and even not long ago, honestly,\""]

["18:39,940","18:43,740","\"They thought McDonald's that Pokemon is was gonna do great\""]
["18:43,740","18:48,380","\"And then Burger King got Lion King and they fucking sold out of all their little plastic toys\""]
["18:48,380","18:49,820","\"They made an entirely new toy line\""]
["18:49,820","18:54,420","\"And then they did a Latin for Burger King Burger King was like getting the best toys\""]
["18:54,420","18:58,300","\"Yeah, I was gonna say don't just getting like fucking plastic cups and other crap from like\""]

["19:07,680","19:15,220","\"Like just little figure reads a little Pokemon is it actually in the pokeball never tell you about the bootleg Pokemon figures\""]
["19:15,220","19:20,400","\"My parents sold no where the official Pokemon figures back in the day\""]
["19:20,400","19:24,740","\"They were like really small right you could fit them in your you know between your index finger and your thumb\""]
["19:24,860","19:30,820","\"But they all they all had this watermark on the bottom of them that was like made in it was even made in to one\""]
["19:30,820","19:35,600","\"Or made in China and a bunch of like you know, they let you know that they're official, right?\""]
["19:35,600","19:40,180","\"So when my mom and dad got in the bootleg Pokemon figures they looked like\""]
["19:40,180","19:46,920","\"fucking shit, right? It was like for Charmander. They definitely just got like a small dinosaur mold and\""]
["19:46,920","19:50,680","\"Like like every time yeah\""]
["19:50,680","19:52,460","\"like\""]
["19:52,460","19:59,460","\"Like it's a little awful like like like everything boo like my mom and that ever got it was it was like it was so bad\""]
["19:59,460","20:03,820","\"And but like I was like doesn't have the watermark. That's what I cared about the most\""]
["20:03,820","20:09,260","\"I didn't care that it looked like utter shit right then eventually they got in figures that looked like insane\""]
["20:09,260","20:13,700","\"Utter shit, but they like faked the watermark on to it. I was like that's it because of you did no\""]
["20:13,700","20:17,380","\"Hell no, that's not cuz I'm like did they like buy the ones with the watermark is you told?\""]

["20:21,460","20:26,580","\"But it was just like a weird coincidence that I happen to be over the watermark and then finally\""]
["20:26,580","20:32,060","\"But that made you into it. Will you saw the watermark? No, then I was like, okay. I accept this. This is official\""]
["20:32,060","20:36,380","\"It was clearly not it was clearly so shit, but I was like, yeah, what's the watermark though?\""]
