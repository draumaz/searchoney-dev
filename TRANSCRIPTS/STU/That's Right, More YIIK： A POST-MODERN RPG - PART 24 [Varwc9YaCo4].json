["18:55,200","19:00,260","\"The only reason I got into flash was because I had a friend that lived down the road for me and he one day\""]
["19:00,260","19:02,400","\"Was just like I'm doing flash cartoons now\""]
["19:02,400","19:07,800","\"And then I was like I guess I have to do it now - and then I looked up\""]
