["00:07,200","00:10,400","\"And you have a dead sister who has died. *laughs*\""]
["00:10,400","00:11,700","\"I know that.\""]

["00:35,240","00:46,000","\"He's the guy who skips the tutorial when he's playing a game here you go guys are not allowed to have a goofball anymore\""]
["00:46,000","00:48,160","\"Okay, they completely changed us\""]
["00:48,160","00:56,400","\"And that's the thing the original is so goofy that I feel like there's got to be something wrong for you to really believe like\""]
["00:56,880","01:00,740","\"That was not intentional. Yeah that he doesn't get it. He doesn't say lemonade\""]
["01:00,740","01:09,680","\"This seems like a shift that was done because of all the complaints he wanted to just be cool\""]
["01:09,680","01:16,860","\"Yeah, which is not as interesting. I think the cutscene obviously flows a lot better now. It's stage better\""]
["01:16,860","01:22,220","\"I do miss the old out I have the epic alpaca. I\""]
["01:22,220","01:25,760","\"Killed my silly well, fucker brother\""]

["02:09,900","02:19,520","\"Oh no.\""]
["02:19,520","02:22,480","\"What?\""]
["02:22,480","02:24,520","\"Right in the dick.\""]
["02:24,520","02:28,560","\"So this isn't the boss fight anymore?\""]
["02:28,560","02:30,040","\"It wasn't.\""]
["02:30,040","02:31,560","\"It was, wasn't it?\""]
["02:31,560","02:33,040","\"No, you fought the alpaca instead.\""]
["02:33,040","02:34,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:34,040","02:36,040","\"That's what I'm talking about.\""]
["02:36,040","02:37,040","\"Oh no.\""]
["02:37,040","02:43,960","\"This is getting too deep, guys.\""]
["02:43,960","02:46,160","\"I can't play anymore.\""]
["02:46,160","02:51,800","\"The star man junior, I mean, Rory died.\""]
["02:51,800","02:52,800","\"Was Rory.\""]
["02:52,800","02:53,800","\"Okay.\""]
["02:53,800","02:58,960","\"Why the cut him and the, and the two pieces like that?\""]
["02:58,960","03:01,680","\"This is a magic trick.\""]
["03:01,680","03:02,940","\"And now you.\""]
["03:02,940","03:06,800","\"How will you justify your continued existence?\""]
["03:06,800","03:08,300","\"I dunno.\""]
["03:08,300","03:10,600","\"You, the viewer.\""]
["03:10,600","03:14,280","\"He got sick of waiting for me.\""]
["03:14,280","03:16,760","\"I didn't push a there.\""]
["03:16,760","03:19,420","\"This is a different song too.\""]
["03:19,420","03:21,760","\"Yeah, so the original just.\""]
["03:21,760","03:26,600","\"I like the real stuff I was just tweeting and it's the funniest shit ever\""]
["03:26,600","03:30,720","\"There you go, then you you appreciated the joke. Yeah\""]
["03:30,720","03:40,240","\"Fuck I like it for a few years. Yeah, can I I guess I would have to ask why would you think in alpaca coming in through a vortex\""]
["03:40,240","03:43,280","\"Sliding into shot and then sing lemonade and flexing\""]
["03:43,280","03:47,280","\"How how would you take that as something being serious?\""]
["03:47,280","03:50,320","\"How would you find that to be a moment where it was supposed to have heart?\""]
["03:50,320","03:55,760","\"I don't think it was supposed to be serious. I think the problem was that that they went from such a dramatic moment to such a\""]
["03:55,760","04:02,360","\"Dumb moment and I think that's how most people I think his dumb moment was supposed to be serious that that's what I don't know\""]
["04:02,360","04:05,960","\"I have no idea. I'm not the guy who made it. It just came off that way\""]
["04:05,960","04:07,320","\"I like it for a few reasons\""]
["04:07,320","04:08,480","\"I like number one\""]
["04:08,480","04:14,200","\"I like that it's just it's just because I like shattering the mood like that because it's a thing that happens in real life\""]
["04:14,200","04:15,480","\"you have a fucking\""]
["04:15,480","04:22,800","\"Like tragedy happened to you and then like you look around and people are like still going to school and like eating hamburgers and shit\""]
["04:22,800","04:24,040","\"That's true\""]
["04:24,040","04:25,760","\"You get that sort of contradiction\""]
["04:25,760","04:31,800","\"But then also just like I like the sort of world building that it gives the idea of like oh that\""]
["04:31,800","04:38,960","\"Like some great like unfathomable cosmic power, you know, it can only be perceived by a human\""]
["04:38,960","04:43,000","\"Something that it is something stupid. I think that's a that's an interesting idea\""]
["04:44,000","04:44,500","\"What?\""]
["04:44,500","04:47,600","\"And I like that it makes it less fucking serious to...\""]
["04:47,600","04:49,500","\"Oh, you have to have her banish it.\""]
["04:49,500","04:50,500","\"It's general.\""]
["04:50,500","04:54,100","\"In general, I don't respond well to things that take themselves too seriously,\""]
["04:54,100","04:59,400","\"so the idea that it can make a joke of itself makes the story more appealing to me.\""]
["04:59,400","05:03,600","\"The problem is when the plot's trying to be serious at already is making a joke of itself.\""]
["05:03,600","05:04,100","\"It's true.\""]
["05:04,100","05:07,000","\"I'm thinking that's probably what threw people off until that moment.\""]
["05:07,000","05:10,000","\"It makes it hard for people to understand what's intentional.\""]
["05:10,000","05:13,900","\"I mean, I was doing it earlier than I was asking about the fucking game\""]
["05:13,900","05:21,500","\"play mechanics but the product of that was now having that moment removed which is a shame\""]
["05:21,500","05:23,820","\"I'm sorry I bumped the mic no more lemonade\""]
["05:23,820","05:31,660","\"go to school what just happened yeah so what is this warning meter I don't know that's a new thing\""]
["05:31,660","05:37,260","\"I just the way this fight used to work is that he would keep summoning those and if you didn't\""]
["05:37,260","05:41,260","\"get rid of them he would absorb them and get muscular and become stronger I guess that's what you need\""]
["05:41,260","05:43,260","\"But I tried hitting them and they didn't do that.\""]
["05:43,260","05:44,500","\"You have to use a skill.\""]
["05:44,500","05:46,260","\"She has one called Banish that she has to use.\""]
["05:46,260","05:48,140","\"Oh, I see.\""]
["05:48,140","05:51,260","\"Yeah, I would you have noticed.\""]
["05:51,260","05:53,660","\"They probably should have established that earlier.\""]
["05:53,660","05:55,820","\"Yeah, that's a problem.\""]
["05:55,820","05:56,820","\"A lot of the things.\""]
["05:56,820","05:58,780","\"You need to have like an enemy to practice it on.\""]
["05:58,780","06:01,060","\"That is something I like about this is most of the things\""]
["06:01,060","06:03,460","\"you do have to figure out on your own.\""]
["06:03,460","06:05,820","\"I can see the appeal in that.\""]
["06:05,820","06:08,580","\"It's weird to be because you can only progress\""]
["06:08,580","06:10,220","\"if you actually explore this.\""]
["06:10,220","06:14,260","\"I don't take it as intentional though because the pause menu has the hint option\""]
["06:14,260","06:21,260","\"Oh, that's a good point that if they would if they were gonna leave you the discovery entirely up to you\""]
["06:21,260","06:24,180","\"They wouldn't they wouldn't give you that sort of assistance\""]
["06:24,180","06:26,180","\"Okay skill\""]
["06:26,180","06:29,220","\"Vanish right there and you do it to the yep\""]
["06:29,220","06:37,660","\"Wait, oh fuck. What am I doing? Yeah, don't press anyone you're around it really you have to attack it. Yes\""]
["06:37,660","06:39,780","\"You have to drain its health\""]
["06:39,900","06:43,700","\"Okay, he's gonna dream mine too. Oh fuck. Oh\""]
["06:43,700","06:47,960","\"Thank God for that. That was so stressful\""]
["06:47,960","06:51,240","\"Yeah\""]
["06:51,240","07:02,020","\"For tonight so you have to face it later. Yes, is that the implication in the mind dungeon it sends it to us\""]
["07:02,020","07:04,420","\"Does that get you like extra experience or anything like that?\""]
["07:04,420","07:08,180","\"I feel like it does give you something I forget what though\""]
["07:08,180","07:11,880","\"But yeah, it hovers over one of the doors now in the mind dungeon\""]
["07:11,880","07:15,940","\"Okay, go banish again. You son of a bitch\""]
["07:15,940","07:22,020","\"He's like why\""]
["07:22,020","07:35,300","\"Jesus what's your time limit? I'm fucked is it just literally you keep going until one of you dies? Well, you got me fuck\""]
["07:36,460","07:38,460","\"Way harder\""]
["07:38,460","07:49,440","\"Yeah, you can play the animation if anything make a secondary animation that shorter and she fumbles on the haver explode I\""]
["07:49,440","07:55,140","\"Swear he just forgot that Michael was even a character at this point\""]
["07:55,140","08:00,860","\"At least the new cutscene acknowledged he was here. That's true. You feel him more than in the original\""]
["08:00,860","08:06,140","\"Yeah, the original cutscene. He's not even present Michael. Yeah, do you think he would have added stuff?\""]
["08:06,140","08:13,100","\"Like later on the game is that one of the complaints that you think he listened to I feel like this was probably partially rushed\""]
["08:13,100","08:15,100","\"It was already in development for a long time\""]
["08:15,100","08:17,780","\"but there's a lot of stuff that\""]
["08:17,780","08:22,580","\"Got left out. There's unused content in the original build of the game that you can find\""]
["08:22,580","08:29,440","\"I know he said he changed the ending kind of like last second during its development and everything -\""]
["08:29,440","08:35,600","\"Early demos of this game kind of went around a different concept to\""]
["08:35,600","08:39,760","\"areas got redesigned so I don't know what the process was like during its\""]
["08:39,760","08:43,680","\"development I don't know where things went but clearly things shifted around\""]
["08:43,680","08:46,800","\"a lot as it was being made I'm glad we're playing this game because it's really\""]
["08:46,800","08:51,680","\"interesting to study I mean that's what I think it takes in terms of like value\""]
["08:51,680","08:57,040","\"here I think that's what it has to offer Rory please eat this fucking\""]
["08:57,040","09:04,160","\"cheeseburger please I'm begging you she's a fucking bastard okay this still did\""]
["09:04,160","09:08,660","\"Better than whatever the fuck the other one was if he's a pacifist what he also refused to eat meat\""]
["09:08,660","09:13,980","\"Yeah, that's what I was gonna say is he also a vegetarian if so there's a problem because you can feed him those items\""]
["09:13,980","09:16,520","\"The cramming into his mouth\""]
["09:16,520","09:18,680","\"You have to pin them down\""]
["09:18,680","09:25,520","\"Great his warning meter went up. Oh, so what's he gonna do now? No\""]
["09:25,520","09:29,760","\"What did it do in the original fight? He got muscular remember\""]
["09:29,760","09:32,400","\"Then there may be hope yet\""]
["09:32,400","09:33,400","\"*laughs*\""]
["09:33,400","09:35,400","\"Oh, maybe this file will be okay.\""]
["09:35,400","09:36,400","\"*laughs*\""]
["09:36,400","09:37,400","\"Oh, Julian.\""]
["09:37,400","09:40,400","\"Maybe being erased from existence wouldn't be the worst thing.\""]
["09:40,400","09:45,400","\"Okay, I'm just gonna use her and Ginger and the other two can heal.\""]
["09:45,400","09:48,400","\"Yeah, you.\""]
["09:48,400","09:49,400","\"Fucking useless bastard.\""]
["09:49,400","09:51,400","\"You need a cheeseburger, why don't you?\""]
["09:51,400","09:53,400","\"Yeah, like that.\""]
["09:53,400","09:55,400","\"Make a smack noise.\""]
["09:55,400","09:58,400","\"Slaps her in the face with it.\""]
["09:58,400","09:59,400","\"Uh-oh.\""]
["09:59,400","10:00,400","\"Holy fuck.\""]
["10:00,400","10:01,400","\"What?\""]
["10:01,400","10:03,800","\"What? Oh no. Holy shit.\""]
["10:03,800","10:08,200","\"Well, that's scary.\""]
["10:08,200","10:11,640","\"Does that heal everybody? It's a full heal of everybody.\""]
["10:11,640","10:14,280","\"It's probably just one person. Yeah, probably one person.\""]
["10:14,280","10:18,840","\"There is a party member you get later who can share like an item with the entire party.\""]
["10:18,840","10:21,800","\"Really? Which is why she's useful to have around.\""]
["10:21,800","10:25,320","\"Oh, hit him now and then I'll use someone else to do that.\""]
["10:25,320","10:29,240","\"That's a good way of upgrading the items without just adding more to the deal.\""]
["10:30,680","10:33,800","\"Although it means you're probably always going to have that party member in them.\""]
["10:33,800","10:36,360","\"That's just too useful of a function.\""]
["10:36,360","10:36,920","\"True.\""]
["10:36,920","10:37,800","\"Okay, you.\""]
["10:37,800","10:42,120","\"If everybody here had something insanely useful, that's how you would balance it out.\""]
["10:42,120","10:45,240","\"A lot of these skills are kind of throw away.\""]
["10:45,240","10:47,720","\"Do you always have to have Alex in the party?\""]
["10:47,720","10:48,520","\"I'm pretty sure.\""]
["10:48,520","10:50,200","\"Okay.\""]
["10:50,200","10:51,800","\"I hate wasting her.\""]
["10:51,800","10:54,040","\"I hate the fact she's the only one that can banish it.\""]
["10:54,040","10:57,880","\"It's just a crap shoot whether or not...\""]
["10:57,880","11:03,520","\"Just don't stand in like any of those eight directions where it shoots fireballs from its body.\""]
["11:03,520","11:04,920","\"It seems like they are everywhere.\""]
["11:04,920","11:06,120","\"It seems like they home in on you too.\""]
["11:06,120","11:06,760","\"Oh, right.\""]
["11:06,760","11:07,520","\"They do zigzag.\""]
["11:07,520","11:08,000","\"I forgot.\""]
["11:08,000","11:08,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:08,240","11:12,920","\"No, it's just standing at an angle from a running away after you hit it is a good idea.\""]
["11:12,920","11:16,360","\"OK, and then he'll I don't even want to heal the other guy.\""]
["11:16,360","11:17,040","\"What's the point?\""]
["11:17,040","11:18,360","\"Just give the alpaca a burger.\""]
["11:18,360","11:20,200","\"Probably friends with him.\""]
["11:20,200","11:23,080","\"He'll buy the first nice thing anybody's ever done for him.\""]
["11:23,080","11:24,360","\"He's really touched.\""]
["11:24,360","11:26,000","\"OK.\""]
["11:26,000","11:27,640","\"Oh, God.\""]
["11:27,640","11:31,560","\"Whoops.\""]
["11:31,560","11:33,060","\"Right on the edge.\""]
["11:33,060","11:34,900","\"Oh no.\""]
["11:34,900","11:36,600","\"That rocks, honestly.\""]
["11:36,600","11:39,520","\"Well at least you have a beauty of his own salts.\""]
["11:39,520","11:40,520","\"He's dead anyway.\""]
["11:40,520","11:44,000","\"I mean he was hardly here to begin with.\""]
["11:44,000","11:46,360","\"Have Rory use the smelling salts.\""]
["11:46,360","11:47,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:47,360","11:48,360","\"He's apparently weak to her too.\""]
["11:48,360","11:49,960","\"Yeah, that's why, yeah.\""]
["11:49,960","11:52,640","\"So she's like the most important one in this fight.\""]
["11:52,640","11:54,640","\"There it is.\""]
["11:54,640","11:59,640","\"Who did that?\""]
["11:59,640","12:01,640","\"Mike likes...\""]
["12:01,640","12:02,640","\"Stop!\""]
["12:02,640","12:06,640","\"You should have dumped a man in shoe that's fucking unfair.\""]
["12:06,640","12:09,640","\"What the fuck, man?\""]
["12:09,640","12:13,640","\"Just fucking leave the other guy dead.\""]
["12:13,640","12:14,640","\"Michael?\""]
["12:14,640","12:15,640","\"Yeah?\""]

["22:22,000","22:23,280","\"I spoke with her manager.\""]
["22:23,280","22:24,920","\"It's like he's anti-girl.\""]
["22:24,920","22:25,840","\"He's repellent.\""]
["22:25,840","22:27,880","\"He can push them all away by existing.\""]
["22:27,880","22:30,480","\"She said she needed to take some time off so I gave it to her.\""]
["22:30,480","22:33,080","\"I want to help. Thank you. See you later, Jackass.\""]
["22:33,080","22:36,080","\"I hadn't spoken with Rory since that night.\""]
["22:36,080","22:37,580","\"It's such an angry man.\""]
["22:37,580","22:38,880","\"As soon as we got out,\""]
["22:38,880","22:42,380","\"Vella went into death on her soul survivors and metaphysics.\""]
["22:42,380","22:45,080","\"Then he ran off saying he needed to clear his head.\""]
["22:45,080","22:47,080","\"Goodbye.\""]
["22:47,080","22:48,880","\"Oh.\""]
["22:48,880","22:50,380","\"He left the stove on.\""]
["22:50,380","22:51,680","\"Nope.\""]
["22:51,680","22:53,280","\"Shit.\""]
["22:53,280","22:56,280","\"Okay, so listen up.\""]
["22:57,480","23:03,020","\"Since a soul survivor has spent a lot of time down here, it's likely we're going to find some very strange things.\""]

["23:04,380","23:05,640","\"\"\"The Talking Poops.\"\"\""]
["23:05,640","23:06,140","\"[laughs]\""]
["23:06,140","23:09,680","\"Okay.\""]
["23:09,680","23:19,080","\"For example, anytime you clip out of bounds, that's just reality breaking.\""]

["23:32,820","23:36,820","\"You know what I'm glad they didn't make any Mario references because there's pipes.\""]
["23:36,820","23:38,820","\"That's actually quite commendable.\""]
["23:38,820","23:39,820","\"It's true.\""]
["23:39,820","23:41,820","\"That would have been the easy thing to do.\""]
