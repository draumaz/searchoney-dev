["01:01,280","01:06,240","\"It's like in the back of your eye that's like rubbing up against the inside of your head.\""]
["01:06,240","01:08,200","\"You have to rinse it off under a sink every once in a while.\""]
["01:08,200","01:11,160","\"It's rubbing up against your optical nerve.\""]
["01:11,160","01:15,160","\"Did you hear about the guy who was walking in the street with his mother's urn?\""]
["01:15,160","01:18,280","\"And there was another man walking in the street with delicious Doritos?\""]
["01:18,280","01:20,840","\"And they both bumped into each other and dropped him.\""]
["01:20,840","01:22,640","\"And they both, oh, sorry about that.\""]
["01:22,640","01:24,640","\"And then the guy lifted up with Doritos.\""]
["01:24,640","01:26,400","\"- With the ashes on it.\""]
["01:26,400","01:28,800","\"- Hey, that's not bad.\""]

["03:24,380","03:27,020","\"a chicken, everybody just treats him like he's some\""]
["03:27,020","03:29,780","\"like virtuoso or genius.\""]
["03:29,780","03:33,220","\"- Seems like a good idea for one single idea\""]

["08:43,340","08:47,100","\"That's definitely the way you're meant to kill them all I think\""]
["08:47,100","08:47,600","\"Oh!\""]
["08:47,600","08:52,560","\"What why did pick it up a key to that? Yeah, I don't get that. That's not fucking fair\""]

["08:55,660","09:01,080","\"You have to get a new costume kill one of these chef's men's I will do just that oh\""]
["09:01,080","09:08,100","\"No, so many people here. It's music scary. It's like the key. What can you open that office?\""]
["09:08,100","09:12,880","\"I guess I need a proper\""]
["09:13,680","09:18,040","\"You can shoot open locks if you have a good enough gun, but the silence gun isn't good enough\""]
["09:18,040","09:23,440","\"So the trade-off is everyone hears it. Yep. I see I see what you're saying\""]
["09:23,440","09:26,520","\"I see I see what you're saying\""]
["09:26,520","09:28,880","\"We gotta become someone new\""]

["09:41,920","09:44,880","\"Aww, see, life's not so bad anymore now.\""]
["09:44,880","09:47,480","\"Oh, maybe we can subdue her and drag her somewhere.\""]
["09:47,480","09:51,320","\"And then drag her under his chandelier.\""]
["09:51,320","09:54,680","\"That is probably the most effective way,\""]
["09:54,680","09:56,320","\"'cause I don't think it'll count.\""]
["09:56,320","09:57,920","\"As long as she isn't dead,\""]
["09:57,920","09:59,760","\"first you gotta clear this room out though.\""]

["10:06,520","10:07,520","\"She'll run away.\""]
["10:07,520","10:10,200","\"Okay, I think I know what to do.\""]
["10:11,560","10:12,600","\"Tom, are you believe?\""]
["10:12,600","10:15,440","\"I believe...\""]
