["00:01,500","00:02,000","\"[DING]\""]
["00:02,000","00:03,600","\"You're living your best life, Chris.\""]
["00:03,600","00:04,600","\"Dang straight.\""]
["00:04,600","00:07,280","\"You're being chased by a giant turd, by the way.\""]
["00:07,280","00:08,840","\"I ain't not going to argue.\""]
["00:08,840","00:10,280","\"I'm a stupid French frog.\""]
["00:10,280","00:12,440","\"He's going to be a sexy monkey later.\""]
["00:12,440","00:14,320","\"Like, you've got to think for the future.\""]
["00:14,320","00:16,840","\"So can you follow you around as War Greymon?\""]
["00:16,840","00:17,340","\"Yes.\""]
["00:17,340","00:18,340","\"Wow.\""]
["00:18,340","00:18,840","\"It'll be fun.\""]
["00:18,840","00:20,560","\"I can't wait to see that.\""]
["00:20,560","00:22,240","\"Chris, you're going to have your man.\""]
["00:22,240","00:22,880","\"My man?\""]
["00:22,880","00:24,240","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["00:24,240","00:27,200","\"Eventually, I really need some memory upgrades.\""]
["00:27,200","00:27,880","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:27,880","00:32,040","\"I forgot that that's not how they regulate how many Digimon are in your party.\""]
["00:32,040","00:37,160","\"It's more about that each Digimon has like a value that gets added.\""]
["00:37,160","00:40,360","\"The nice thing about Succaman, does any give you an experience bonus?\""]
["00:40,360","00:43,720","\"Yes. No, it's gold.\""]
["00:43,720","00:45,080","\"I thought it gives you like a mild one.\""]
["00:45,080","00:46,440","\"Gold, my mind or something like that.\""]
["00:46,440","00:48,520","\"Yeah, I know there's those new mamamam that do it.\""]
["00:48,520","00:52,440","\"You could potentially turn Succaman into that though.\""]
["00:52,440","00:53,480","\"Succaman.\""]
["00:53,480","00:53,960","\"Couldn't you?\""]
["00:53,960","00:55,880","\"Yes, I could potentially.\""]
["00:55,880","00:58,380","\"Can we play a game that has bigger tits?\""]
["00:58,380","01:00,280","\"I don't know if you're gonna find one.\""]
["01:00,280","01:00,880","\"Okay.\""]
["01:00,880","01:02,480","\"Sorry.\""]
["01:02,480","01:03,680","\"Well, but that are alive.\""]
["01:03,680","01:05,080","\"Can we play that are alive?\""]
["01:05,080","01:06,880","\"We have that are alive.\""]
["01:06,880","01:08,880","\"I don't think I could play it.\""]
["01:08,880","01:11,580","\"Oh, it is a fighting game.\""]
["01:11,580","01:12,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:12,180","01:18,380","\"And you are anti violence and the anti nudity and anti fun.\""]
["01:18,380","01:20,880","\"Oh, wait, just go to history and I jiggle.\""]
["01:20,880","01:23,080","\"I had to say something.\""]
["01:23,080","01:25,480","\"- TV original Dead Aralay's breast physics.\""]
["01:25,480","01:27,340","\"- No, it's good.\""]
["01:27,340","01:29,580","\"- No, that's why it's good.\""]
["01:29,580","01:30,420","\"- I wanna see.\""]
["01:30,420","01:32,480","\"- They go in slow motion and they have like\""]
["01:32,480","01:35,800","\"moon gravity on them and they move independently.\""]
["01:35,800","01:36,640","\"- Good.\""]
["01:36,640","01:38,920","\"- It's like you're fighting a weird alien creature.\""]
["01:38,920","01:41,000","\"- I'm gonna look up Dead Aralay physics.\""]
["01:41,000","01:43,360","\"Oh yeah, came up straight away.\""]
["01:43,360","01:47,800","\"Hey team Ninja, thanks for not backing down.\""]
["01:47,800","01:52,000","\"What's going on now?\""]
["01:52,880","01:56,240","\"We just went to do a mission for her.\""]
["01:56,240","01:57,720","\"- Is she as bait is macking on you?\""]
["01:57,720","02:00,360","\"- She introduced us to the idea that some people\""]
["02:00,360","02:03,720","\"abuse their Digimon and then--\""]
["02:03,720","02:05,000","\"- Why would anyone do such a thing?\""]
["02:05,000","02:06,160","\"- Yeah, I can't imagine.\""]
["02:06,160","02:09,960","\"And then now that we've done that,\""]
["02:09,960","02:13,440","\"she's gonna tell us that we can send them\""]
["02:13,440","02:16,040","\"on their own little investigations if we want.\""]
["02:16,040","02:17,320","\"- I see.\""]
["02:17,320","02:19,200","\"- What are the investigations for?\""]
["02:19,200","02:20,040","\"'Cause I know that's how I can--\""]
["02:20,040","02:22,600","\"- I remember just being like, they bring back money\""]
["02:22,600","02:24,440","\"and they get experience or something like that.\""]
["02:24,440","02:25,600","\"- Okay.\""]
["02:25,600","02:26,840","\"It's neat, it's cool idea.\""]
["02:26,840","02:27,600","\"- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,\""]
["02:27,600","02:31,200","\"that's what I'm thinking of, like,\""]
["02:31,200","02:32,560","\"you can have them hunt for items.\""]
["02:32,560","02:33,880","\"- Yeah, I'm thinking of them.\""]
["02:33,880","02:35,040","\"- No, no, no, that's what I was thinking of too,\""]
["02:35,040","02:35,880","\"is the iron thing.\""]
["02:35,880","02:38,920","\"- They find you additional jobs to take on,\""]
["02:38,920","02:39,760","\"is what it actually is.\""]
["02:39,760","02:40,600","\"- Oh.\""]
["02:40,600","02:43,560","\"- They're always small and consequential things,\""]
["02:43,560","02:45,240","\"they're not like story related or anything,\""]
["02:45,240","02:48,440","\"but it's like extra work if you need more money.\""]
["02:48,440","02:50,680","\"- It's cool, there's so much to do grinding,\""]
["02:50,680","02:56,480","\"Yeah, it's no it's I could play this game forever. I know there is a new Digimon game like\""]
["02:56,480","03:05,360","\"That's survived. Yeah, I forgot I hope it's good because I like the idea why I like the first season the best\""]
["03:05,360","03:08,520","\"Is I really like that survival angle?\""]
["03:08,520","03:14,860","\"I like the idea of being alone in a place that you don't know that's what's gonna be about. Yeah cool\""]
["03:14,860","03:16,860","\"I want to play that\""]
["03:16,860","03:18,920","\"So do I is it out yet?\""]
["03:19,240","03:26,760","\"Don't know I haven't looked into it cuz I knew it was in development and looked interesting is it from the same people that made this\""]
["03:26,760","03:32,080","\"It's not the same style at all actually it's like an isometric strategy. Yeah, I was gonna say isn't it like a\""]
["03:32,080","03:34,920","\"strategy game or something like that\""]
["03:34,920","03:36,640","\"weird\""]
["03:36,640","03:38,160","\"So it's interesting\""]
["03:38,160","03:44,560","\"Tactics yeah kind of it's interesting. How did you mind games just kind of go through all these different designs?\""]
["03:45,080","03:50,680","\"Yeah, every Digimon game is like its own weird thing. Oh, that looks kind of cool actually. They're not like that\""]
["03:50,680","03:57,000","\"I'll come on. There's that new season. They redid adventure. Yeah, I don't assume you've watched that right Chris\""]
["03:57,000","04:04,440","\"There's a new season of adventure. Yeah, it's like a remake of the first make up the first season of Digimon\""]
["04:04,440","04:10,040","\"Why would they do that? I don't trust it. That sounds like I haven't seen that so I don't know that sounds like a bad idea\""]
["04:10,040","04:12,040","\"But it might be good everybody that I've heard\""]
["04:12,040","04:14,480","\"That watched it liked it\""]
["04:14,640","04:21,760","\"But but then again, I think I'm the biggest Digimon nerd out of people that I know I just remembered. I really like Debbie Mons\""]
["04:21,760","04:23,440","\"He is cool\""]
["04:23,440","04:24,880","\"Can you get him?\""]
["04:24,880","04:31,480","\"Like when there were humanoid Digimon back then if they were like that they'd have some kind of weird feature they usually had\""]
["04:31,480","04:37,440","\"They always had weird proportions. I was just like a really long overly long arms. Oh\""]
["04:37,440","04:40,160","\"Wow, I haven't looked at the leaves in a long time\""]
["04:40,160","04:43,600","\"He's just looking to Digimon design. Yeah\""]
["04:43,600","04:44,800","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:44,800","04:47,000","\"- I remember I was obsessed with it as a kid.\""]
["04:47,000","04:49,920","\"I had the virtual pet first,\""]
["04:49,920","04:51,800","\"the anime I watched all the time.\""]
["04:51,800","04:53,920","\"I even have a lot of those cards.\""]
["04:53,920","04:58,240","\"- Did you like the digital pet before the cartoon?\""]
["04:58,240","05:00,360","\"- Did I like it before the cartoon?\""]
["05:00,360","05:02,200","\"- Like as in, were you more familiar\""]
["05:02,200","05:05,400","\"with the tiny little pixel sprites?\""]
["05:05,400","05:06,440","\"- Oh, yeah, I was.\""]
["05:06,440","05:07,840","\"- For their actual designs.\""]
["05:07,840","05:09,840","\"- Getting to have it actually on a cartoon obviously\""]
["05:09,840","05:11,980","\"is way better than just having a tiny little thing\""]
["05:11,980","05:13,000","\"on a screen. - Yeah.\""]
["05:13,000","05:17,000","\"It was ninking to see everything come to life because all those designs are really good.\""]
["05:17,000","05:23,500","\"And the anime ended up turning out pretty well, like considering what it is.\""]
["05:23,500","05:25,500","\"Could have been really bad.\""]
["05:25,500","05:26,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:26,000","05:27,300","\"It could have been absolutely.\""]
["05:27,300","05:30,700","\"Or just like extremely uninteresting and formulaic.\""]
["05:30,700","05:38,400","\"Like Pokemon, I tried to follow it as a kid and I jumped off it pretty early just because it didn't feel like anything really mattered in it.\""]
["05:38,400","05:39,800","\"It wasn't making progress.\""]
["05:40,200","05:43,240","\"It's really frustrating how much padding there was in Pokémon.\""]
["05:43,240","05:46,280","\"It starts off strong, like it starts off with promise.\""]
["05:46,280","05:51,000","\"It's not amazing or anything, but it has an okay start.\""]
["05:51,000","05:54,520","\"It does, no, because for the first few episodes they, they must have been\""]
["05:54,520","06:00,440","\"either on purpose or accidentally like a change of philosophy when writing those episodes.\""]
["06:00,440","06:05,480","\"You know, it's weird with a lot of shows. The first episode is one of the weaker ones because\""]
["06:05,480","06:07,200","\"It's essentially the pilot\""]
["06:07,200","06:11,680","\"But with Pokemon the first episode might be one of the strongest episodes\""]
["06:11,680","06:16,720","\"Which is kind of bizarre her one ashes voices all alone weird in the first I do yeah\""]
["06:16,720","06:19,800","\"I find it more charmed calls it a pokeball pokeball\""]
["06:19,800","06:27,800","\"Oh my god, I've been seeing these in so long\""]
["06:27,800","06:32,360","\"Atemon fucking weird glasses monkey. That's the one that Julian wants\""]
["06:33,920","06:35,920","\"God that's so weird looking\""]
["06:35,920","06:41,560","\"Do you like that? It's like the like his costume has like veins on it. I like it\""]
["06:41,560","06:44,240","\"It's like it's part of his body. Why do you think he is what he is?\""]
["06:44,240","06:52,680","\"I don't know every Digimon like has a bio like you can look into what sort of data they're supposed to be made of I think\""]
["06:52,680","07:00,360","\"Yours he's just like an mp3 file or something. Yeah, I like the big bug that chases them in the first episode\""]
["07:00,360","07:02,360","\"He's like coagum on yeah, it was cool\""]
["07:03,040","07:05,940","\"All the bugs are really fun. They always have like\""]
["07:05,940","07:12,900","\"Intense mouths. Yeah, they're very buggy. They're not like the bugs are buggy. They're not a\""]
["07:12,900","07:15,960","\"Anthroporifies as much as a lot of the other ones are\""]
["07:15,960","07:26,700","\"Did you have the virtual pet croose? No, I just had a tomagotchi. I didn't know that that was a thing for years later\""]
["07:27,440","07:28,720","\"- Tellgachi.\""]
["07:28,720","07:32,000","\"- Whoa, I sort of, but yeah, it's on like both.\""]
["07:32,000","07:35,200","\"- I think the anime is what actually let a lot of people\""]
["07:35,200","07:36,760","\"know about Digimon. - I would assume.\""]
["07:36,760","07:39,520","\"- The virtual pet, I loved it,\""]
["07:39,520","07:42,160","\"but I don't remember many people talking about it.\""]
["07:42,160","07:43,360","\"Like I remember being one,\""]
["07:43,360","07:45,700","\"the only people I knew of who had one.\""]
["07:45,700","07:48,480","\"But the anime was a big hit.\""]
["07:48,480","07:50,840","\"People liked it. - I already saw it.\""]
["07:50,840","07:52,880","\"- It was on Fox Kids, remember?\""]
["07:52,880","07:55,040","\"Subbanjo did. - I better not have a fucking sub.\""]
["07:55,040","07:57,360","\"- Oh, I remember Impmon was he in season three.\""]
["07:57,360","08:01,120","\"Yeah, I like him his evolution is not very fun to me\""]
["08:01,120","08:05,920","\"I wish that it was still like goofy looking but I like him on a wizard mod\""]
["08:05,920","08:08,280","\"That's stupid\""]
["08:08,280","08:14,060","\"That's just a word and then mine. He dies remember. I do good radio mine\""]
["08:14,060","08:16,640","\"good\""]
["08:16,640","08:22,000","\"Why can't that be Zelda's personality in the new game I was active I would love that\""]
["08:22,880","08:24,520","\"- More personality than she's ever had.\""]
["08:24,520","08:26,560","\"- I would love to see. - Tetra was getting close.\""]
["08:26,560","08:27,880","\"- It's true, and then--\""]
["08:27,880","08:29,840","\"- I know they had heard her stuff.\""]
["08:29,840","08:32,320","\"Weirdest fucking thing to me, I don't understand.\""]
["08:32,320","08:34,640","\"- It is really bizarre, 'cause I really like Tetra.\""]
["08:34,640","08:35,480","\"- Me too.\""]
["08:35,480","08:37,680","\"- For some reason, when I look up list of Digimon,\""]
["08:37,680","08:39,760","\"nothing fucking good comes up.\""]
["08:39,760","08:40,760","\"- No, you're, 'cause there's more--\""]
["08:40,760","08:42,040","\"- You're gonna see a lot of new designs.\""]
["08:42,040","08:44,800","\"- It's been going for so long that there's more boring stuff\""]
["08:44,800","08:46,400","\"than there is interesting stuff.\""]
["08:46,400","08:47,240","\"- That's sucks.\""]
["08:47,240","08:48,760","\"- The designs can go all over the place,\""]
["08:48,760","08:50,920","\"depending on what year they were designed in.\""]
["08:50,920","08:52,080","\"- I don't know if there's like at least\""]
["08:52,080","08:54,400","\"- Some of the more recent ones,\""]
["08:54,400","08:57,680","\"they're sort of trying to make a certain attempt\""]
["08:57,680","08:59,400","\"to capture the original style.\""]
["08:59,400","09:00,240","\"- Yeah, okay.\""]
["09:00,240","09:01,840","\"- But it's still not gross, it's just,\""]
["09:01,840","09:04,240","\"okay, now it can be a weird object again.\""]
["09:04,240","09:06,000","\"- Ooh, I remember Andrew Mona liked him.\""]
["09:06,000","09:07,920","\"- Yeah, he's cool. - He's super cool, yeah.\""]
["09:07,920","09:12,680","\"- He's got his Phantom of the Paradise mask.\""]
["09:12,680","09:16,080","\"Season two, I know, is like the jumping off point\""]
["09:16,080","09:17,320","\"for a lot of people.\""]
["09:17,320","09:19,080","\"- I mean, I understand it was a mess.\""]
["09:19,080","09:20,560","\"- Yeah, it was.\""]
["09:20,560","09:21,960","\"It was multiple writers, right?\""]
["09:21,960","09:26,360","\"Just kept going in different directions. Everybody was like talking the story and the direction they wanted to go\""]
["09:26,360","09:32,160","\"So therefore it doesn't go anywhere. What was season four like cuz I never watched that was frontier\""]
["09:32,160","09:36,560","\"That's where did you ever see it? Yeah, did you ever see that one Chris? I would imagine not\""]
["09:36,560","09:45,600","\"Yeah, it's that instead of having Digimon they turn into them which what to me is not as interesting an idea\""]
["09:45,600","09:51,900","\"They're also all like a lot more boring. It's that later aesthetic of like everything is a cool\""]
["09:51,900","09:56,580","\"Robot Man. What is it about kids and just liking fucking scary ass monsters, huh?\""]
["09:56,580","10:02,940","\"It's a good question. I don't I don't really have an answer, but it I like I definitely like it\""]
["10:02,940","10:05,420","\"I'm not sure. I'm not sure what it is\""]

["15:03,740","15:04,280","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:04,280","15:09,100","\"But then it's a deleted scene and you can see a rough animatic of it.\""]

["15:24,540","15:26,980","\"Pretty good\""]
["15:26,980","15:33,060","\"But the thing was in an interview he makes a big deal out of this because he's like oh we have a response in the words\""]
["15:33,060","15:41,020","\"That's what they came up with and they didn't even use it because they realized like it's not you gotta do more than that\""]

["15:46,940","15:53,020","\"You have to have a little more of a response than that. Did I ever tell you about the there's a video on YouTube?\""]
["15:53,020","15:58,480","\"It was called Trey Parker's micro penis or something. I remember that one. It's a really like\""]
["15:58,480","16:05,580","\"Visually they capture the style. Yes, but the voice acting and everything the script itself. Oh no, but here's the thing right?\""]
["16:05,580","16:07,580","\"I'm pretty sure that so\""]
["16:07,580","16:10,680","\"First first of all context was some guy made a video called\""]
["16:10,680","16:14,020","\"Trey Parker's micro penis impressive. Yeah, it's really impressive\""]
["16:14,020","16:21,100","\"He made like a 10 minute video in the style of South Park that looked exactly spot onto the show 100% perfect\""]
["16:21,100","16:28,140","\"But it's about like Trey Parker singing about having a micro penis and what I assumed happened was this guy was like\""]
["16:28,140","16:31,280","\"I'm gonna make this and hopefully Trey Parker will see it\""]
["16:31,280","16:32,120","\"I don't love it\""]
["16:32,120","16:37,980","\"But because it was like so badly like written then like it's about Trey Parker having a micro penis\""]
["16:37,980","16:39,980","\"I'm sure Trey Parker saw it and went\""]
["16:42,180","16:48,260","\"Yes, and then just like like you know skipped over and then it got deleted like really shortly after I don't know who made it\""]
["16:48,260","16:54,060","\"But it was really well done. Yeah, it was really well done and it was it was from like years and years and years ago\""]
["16:54,060","16:59,920","\"I remember it used to come up as recommended, but let that be a lesson to all the people who think that getting a guy\""]
["16:59,920","17:04,020","\"Know she'd buy and salt again the thing I'd say is if you're gonna be\""]
["17:04,020","17:08,100","\"Imitating something like that take note of everything not just the visuals. Yeah\""]
["17:09,260","17:13,800","\"You know writing style. No, it kind of did seem like he got the writing style down\""]
["17:13,800","17:19,620","\"It just wasn't funny because of the voices and it's like a loose vague understanding of the writing styles\""]
["17:19,620","17:23,260","\"What it feels like just like oh micro penis. That's like a concept\""]
["17:23,260","17:27,580","\"They'd probably throw away into an episode somewhere but like also sometimes if you get\""]
["17:27,580","17:33,900","\"Like over the the line of being close to the original it becomes kind of try-hard and cringy\""]
["17:33,900","17:37,820","\"I don't know. I mean there there's yeah, there's kind of like a dip off\""]
["17:38,300","17:40,300","\"It's like the uncanny valley. Yeah\""]
["17:40,300","17:45,400","\"That if you play just right then everyone gets to be impressed by like\""]
["17:45,400","17:52,300","\"5% less than the original so he was in the uncanny valley. Yeah, I'm sorry to insult you guy if you're out there\""]
["17:52,300","17:58,520","\"No, I'm gonna say everybody's gotta go through it. Yeah\""]
