["08:11,900","08:16,940","\"Fuck you're in last place. No dumbass. So I really am supposed to be collecting shit. Yeah, it does not matter\""]
["08:16,940","08:22,020","\"It's not an actual race. There's nothing counting what they were like. Oh, it's your end. So the game is not\""]
["08:22,020","08:24,300","\"No, you have to actually just collect those. That's it\""]
["08:24,300","08:31,340","\"He said he had to win it for George. Yeah, I said he had to win it. No, he said he had to collect ten of those things to win\""]
["08:31,340","08:36,980","\"Sure, we could race, but I could also collect a bunch of eggs. You just collect a bunch of ends. I'm gonna get my my inward pass\""]

["09:04,200","09:11,340","\"They just not feel confident in this racing points, but they just want you to collect ends\""]
["09:11,340","09:15,620","\"Yeah, they weren't confident. That's it. That's all you have to do. Yeah, I guess so\""]
["09:15,620","09:18,940","\"Well, you did it. So there was no challenge there. No, that was it\""]
["09:18,940","09:22,620","\"Now I think you have to go find the exit. I could do that\""]
["09:22,620","09:26,240","\"Or you have to collect those two apparently no\""]
["09:26,240","09:29,660","\"Please no is it riding a magic carpet?\""]
["09:29,660","09:33,180","\"The one we go the one in red. No, it's like a paddle boat\""]

["09:38,820","09:41,740","\"So you just have to fucking collect all ten and then complete the race\""]
["09:41,740","09:49,460","\"What's sailing like that I would have been in the Navy you're a tiny mouse that wouldn't go well\""]

["10:08,400","10:13,800","\"This is not a rage you just have to collect the ten things again. Are you serious? That's our mo control car from Radio Shack remember\""]
["10:13,800","10:15,800","\"Yeah, we're the stoops\""]
["10:15,800","10:20,640","\"This is real family that gave them up and now they race them as well. Yeah, they\""]
["10:20,640","10:26,920","\"Wasn't it was like that fucking ranch if you remember the movie they were two impersonators that weren't his real parents really\""]
["10:26,920","10:34,440","\"Wait, is that real? No, there's family and there was also the the whole thing at the beginning that there's a bunch of kids\""]
["10:34,440","10:38,080","\"up the orphanage that they could adopt, but then they see a mouse on the floor and they\""]
["10:38,080","10:39,720","\"decided to cut that instead.\""]
["10:39,720","10:42,920","\"Imagine being so brain dead that you would pick a mouse over an actual human child.\""]
["10:42,920","10:44,880","\"It's just insulting to all the kids there.\""]
["10:44,880","10:48,080","\"It's just that the mouse had weird kind of brain power.\""]
["10:48,080","10:52,880","\"Yeah, but like on the count of the fact that he thought like a human, he had like a weird\""]
["10:52,880","10:55,240","\"brain that's more like a normal kid.\""]
["10:55,240","10:57,240","\"That's true.\""]
["10:57,240","10:58,240","\"You would have done the same.\""]
["10:58,240","11:00,040","\"Oh, this kid hates him.\""]
["11:00,040","11:01,040","\"This map is so small.\""]
["11:01,040","11:06,100","\"Just like if you go past it after collecting all five you just get five more in the same position\""]
["11:06,100","11:13,220","\"That happened last time - fuck did it yeah, also now. I remember the stutes. You're right. Yeah the two CGI rats show up\""]

["29:35,240","29:37,480","\"Yeah, he does like that\""]

["29:52,080","29:56,960","\"Don't think that's what Stuart Little's doing. He functions kind of like a person rather than a mouse\""]
["29:56,960","30:03,600","\"He's wearing little sneakers. We're not fucking the last three pieces of this shit\""]
["30:03,600","30:09,240","\"It's not on the ground you already got it there. There's nothing on the ground. It has to be up here\""]

["30:13,040","30:18,160","\"We've been going up to these branches how many times now it's true my turn\""]
["30:18,160","30:20,900","\"All right, hold on we get to the top for you a little bit boy\""]
["30:21,280","30:23,280","\"You've been playing the whole time\""]
["30:23,280","30:27,600","\"What's up here? That's just cheese\""]
["30:27,600","30:34,700","\"I have done that go to the left maybe there's something\""]
["30:34,700","30:42,340","\"Can you make that jump can you get up there? There's probably a thing up there\""]
["30:42,340","30:45,240","\"Wait a minute\""]
["30:45,240","30:48,000","\"Now if you go this way, this is all yeah\""]
["30:48,600","30:52,520","\"But there's definitely a way to get up there. There's gotta be how I do know\""]
["30:52,520","30:55,400","\"Let's try step it on that thing\""]
["30:55,400","30:57,880","\"Let's see\""]
["30:57,880","31:04,560","\"Where's this there you go? I hate these fucking branches more than any. Oh, I just hold it just speed it up while you're bouncing\""]
["31:04,560","31:07,400","\"Oh, yeah\""]
["31:07,400","31:17,440","\"You don't to keep bouncing you can I mean if you keep your velocity will go. I'm a miss you it. Yeah\""]
["31:18,000","31:21,920","\"Manging doing here. I love being a rat. What do you get up there?\""]
["31:21,920","31:28,840","\"We're trying to bounce and use the bouncing it up there actually couldn't no I don't think it looks like there's stuff up there though\""]
["31:28,840","31:30,840","\"there yeah\""]
["31:30,840","31:32,840","\"Don't do it Stuart\""]
["31:32,840","31:34,840","\"He's wave-dashing\""]
["31:34,840","31:40,700","\"I'm starting to suspect that Stuart little on Game Boy Color might not be the best game. No, it's awesome\""]
["31:40,700","31:44,760","\"But shit, I don't know that might just be me or something no no no no\""]
["31:45,600","31:50,700","\"Dickey gawkey gawd look at me go. Oh look at me go look at me go. I'm a little rat\""]
["31:50,700","32:01,220","\"Man there's a real difficulty curve that happened around this level 6 after the racing, you know, it gets really hard\""]
["32:01,220","32:03,220","\"It's really open the level\""]
["32:03,220","32:07,220","\"Have you guys played Stuart little on Game Boy Color it gave me quite a challenge\""]
["32:07,220","32:14,600","\"The forest area was quite difficult all right make that jump\""]
["32:14,600","32:15,600","\"What?\""]
["32:15,600","32:16,600","\"You shit!\""]
["32:16,600","32:17,600","\"That's fucking awful!\""]
["32:17,600","32:23,600","\"I thought the bouncy branches were a neat idea, but they're pretty tricky to get a hold\""]

["32:24,600","32:25,600","\"Look, where is this place?\""]
