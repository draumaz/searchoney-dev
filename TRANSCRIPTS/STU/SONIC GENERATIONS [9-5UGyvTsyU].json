["00:07,960","00:09,320","\"I just start playing it.\""]
["00:09,320","00:10,180","\"And he drives home.\""]
["00:10,180","00:14,560","\"This game has one of the worst stories in like Sonic history, but the gameplay is like the best.\""]
["00:14,560","00:15,780","\"Explain?\""]
["00:15,780","00:17,060","\"The story just sucks.\""]

["00:24,000","00:24,960","\"It just doesn't hit.\""]

["00:25,440","00:26,320","\"Oh my god, isn't that strange?\""]
["00:26,320","00:28,760","\"It's like, oh god, it's like Sonic.exe.\""]
["00:28,760","00:32,160","\"Look at this scary shit. So I turn it all the way down to make it like a\""]
["00:32,160","00:36,380","\"Way too scary. We're gonna push this into October\""]
["00:36,380","00:41,760","\"Serve to piss me off. All right. I'll just do that. No, I don't need hands\""]

["00:48,400","00:54,360","\"Okay, sorry guys, it's okay, man\""]
["00:54,880","01:00,160","\"You just can't be doing stuff like that. So we're coming off of right off of Shadow the Hedgehog\""]
["01:00,160","01:04,960","\"You're literally seeing the future which you would be I don't know you say to the past so yeah\""]
["01:04,960","01:09,820","\"We just we just got off like Shadow the Hedgehog and Corey loved it so much\""]
["01:09,820","01:14,320","\"You're pretty fast\""]
["01:14,320","01:16,320","\"Yeah in this game you go really quickly\""]
["01:16,320","01:23,260","\"Whoa, I know it's not a one-to-one of the original classics, but it's still way better than what forces fucking attempted\""]
["01:23,260","01:27,700","\"Why didn't they just make a full game of this huh? They did it's called sonic generations\""]
["01:27,700","01:33,700","\"But what I mean after that when they take this engine and just make a new game for I think that's what the okay\""]
["01:33,700","01:36,460","\"This is what sonic frontiers is gonna be no, it's not\""]
["01:36,460","01:41,100","\"Yeah, I mean without classic sonic, but the modern stages look a lot like it\""]
["01:41,100","01:43,740","\"Have you seen them? No? Yeah\""]
["01:43,740","01:46,140","\"They look pretty similar maybe\""]
["01:46,140","01:52,100","\"Like Haiti on that game. I've literally I've not seen that much of it, but I'm just I can go I can go in my spiel\""]
["01:52,100","01:57,500","\"Please cuz I actually have an ignoramus. No, it's fine. It's fine. I don't know any about Sonic Frontiers\""]
["01:57,500","02:03,460","\"Um the thing about Sonic's frontiers is it had one of the worst marketing campaigns ever its first\""]
["02:03,460","02:09,620","\"Reveal trailer was like the worst quality and it was like the person playing had no idea\""]
["02:09,620","02:13,140","\"I'm also a giant empty nothing. No, no, yeah\""]
["02:13,140","02:20,020","\"It was also an early build like they were showing early everything. Is it that scary that they're releasing footage. That's early\""]
["02:20,020","02:27,980","\"Yeah, I mean to me that's really bad. That's just read is like honest. No, it wasn't it wasn't honest because the thing about frontiers\""]
["02:27,980","02:32,060","\"They lied to make it look worse. No, no, you're you're being antagonistic\""]
["02:32,060","02:35,960","\"Frontiers, there's two different types of play styles\""]
["02:35,960","02:43,620","\"There's speed and like platform control the dipshit that was playing was just walking around because nobody probably told him that he needed to speed\""]
["02:43,620","02:49,700","\"So he was just meandering around instead of like speeding around like anyone who plays a sonic game would do\""]
["02:49,700","02:57,260","\"Because if you look at future like gameplay examples, it shows like you know real parkouring and stuff and real sense of movement\""]
["02:57,260","02:59,900","\"Instead of just like me angering back and right\""]
["02:59,900","03:04,260","\"But the thing about first years that I want to talk about compared to like so fucking loud\""]
["03:04,260","03:11,540","\"I'm just gonna delegate. Yeah, like just a shh minute. We'll turn down to like there. Yeah, yeah, that's good\""]
["03:11,540","03:15,900","\"That's so much better. I'll go into frontiers about this. It's me and my friend's birthday, so\""]
["03:17,140","03:21,700","\"Been there done that it was your birthday yesterday. He didn't fucking tell me. I'm sorry\""]
["03:21,700","03:26,060","\"I was sick and I forgot I would have held the bucket for you\""]
["03:26,060","03:31,860","\"I literally forgot that it was my birthday until one day a year. I would have done. I opened my pocket before he pooped it\""]
["03:31,860","03:36,940","\"I forgot it was my birthday until I opened Twitter and saw balloons popping up and I'm like, oh shit\""]
["03:36,940","03:38,940","\"Yeah, it's my birthday\""]
["03:38,940","03:43,860","\"Even Rouge came to his birthday. That's nice of her. Yeah, I thought she didn't give a shit about nobody\""]
["03:44,180","03:49,120","\"Well sonic became friends with everybody you get jealous by using his try that Rouge was like\""]
["03:49,120","03:52,040","\"Do you have any weird shit? She was a message me and she's like not\""]
["03:52,040","03:57,300","\"She's good jealous. I told you she was no way that's how\""]
["03:57,300","04:02,840","\"I want proof and I don't want proof that she sent you a trial version of her fuck she did\""]
["04:02,840","04:06,820","\"She didn't she didn't tell me to subscribe to her only fan. She was actually interested me for me\""]
["04:06,820","04:08,820","\"No, she sent you the trial version\""]
["04:08,820","04:12,100","\"Rouge pussy and\""]
["04:12,100","04:14,100","\"Yeah, but we're working up to it\""]
["04:14,100","04:19,220","\"$1,000 I'm not just saying this but can you not like flirt with her?\""]
["04:19,220","04:32,420","\"I'm not just saying this I like I kind of like her you kind of like Rouge. Yeah, well I like blazing\""]
["04:32,420","04:36,260","\"Talking no one's talking about those\""]
["04:38,900","04:43,420","\"But her pussy's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway. I'm sure I'm no it's yeah\""]
["04:43,420","04:49,500","\"I got a hallway size hot. I'm just gonna find that just means it's gonna stay a bit more places. It's she's built for me\""]
["04:49,500","04:55,260","\"Shut up. She's built for horses. I'm sorry. You're just being a dickhead Chris. I'm actually sorry\""]
["04:55,260","04:59,140","\"Take don't Chris is tossing water bottle\""]
["04:59,140","05:01,940","\"- Oh, no, the fuck. - Holy shit.\""]
["05:01,940","05:04,220","\"You just stand and get the law, it's pretty fucking soda.\""]
["05:04,220","05:05,780","\"- It's pretty soda. - Yeah.\""]
["05:05,780","05:07,060","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:07,060","05:09,340","\"- The bit went too far, okay there, man.\""]
["05:09,340","05:10,700","\"- Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris, I played this thing\""]
["05:10,700","05:12,740","\"at 8th of all, it slid in.\""]
["05:12,740","05:14,260","\"- So that's the story basically.\""]
["05:14,260","05:15,740","\"We just go to each level and like,\""]
["05:15,740","05:17,960","\"- Like color it and really fast? - Yeah.\""]
["05:17,960","05:20,120","\"So I wanna talk about sonic frontiers.\""]
["05:20,120","05:21,460","\"So the thing about sonic frontiers,\""]
["05:21,460","05:23,620","\"like people are complaining about like,\""]
["05:23,620","05:25,420","\"they're, oh this is really disturbing, I was like.\""]
["05:25,420","05:26,260","\"- No, no, no, no, no. - What's the point?\""]
["05:26,260","05:27,620","\"- Before you say, I just wanted to,\""]
["05:27,620","05:29,820","\"Is the consensus now that it was like,\""]
["05:29,820","05:30,740","\"(Crowd cheering)\""]
["05:30,740","05:32,260","\"is the now consensus,\""]
["05:32,260","05:33,260","\"'cause you know, I don't really,\""]
["05:33,260","05:34,300","\"it's just interesting to know,\""]
["05:34,300","05:35,580","\"'cause I haven't really checked.\""]
["05:35,580","05:37,180","\"But are people now saying what you're saying\""]
["05:37,180","05:38,860","\"or are you kind of defending it against people\""]
["05:38,860","05:40,820","\"that largely don't like it?\""]
["05:40,820","05:42,580","\"- I'm, what does the internet think of it?\""]
["05:42,580","05:44,620","\"- The internet is totally mixed.\""]
["05:44,620","05:46,860","\"Here's what I personally think Frontier's gonna do.\""]
["05:46,860","05:49,380","\"I think Frontier's is gonna do great with critics\""]
["05:49,380","05:51,300","\"and it's gonna be mixed with fans.\""]
["05:51,300","05:54,380","\"But I also think that Frontier's the first time\""]
["05:54,380","05:57,020","\"in a very long time that they're trying something new.\""]
["05:57,020","06:04,700","\"It's been a very long time since they've just done something that wasn't like Sonic running to point like the the generation style sages that they're doing are like in the game\""]
["06:04,700","06:11,540","\"But they're like their side content the actual game itself is like like a Tony Hawk playground\""]
["06:11,540","06:16,700","\"Where you run around and like grind on rails and stuff to get to the next area and like fight enemies and level up and shit\""]
["06:16,700","06:20,600","\"It's very it seems like they ripped off breath of the wild a little bit\""]
["06:20,600","06:21,660","\"They definitely\""]
["06:21,660","06:25,060","\"A lot of games tried to do that after that they ripped off breath of the wild\""]
["06:25,060","06:31,400","\"But it's not the same because it's not open world. It is no it isn't it isn't it's it's separated in hemispheres\""]
["06:31,400","06:33,900","\"There's like I like the wild though breath of the well\""]
["06:33,900","06:38,800","\"I don't like breath of the wild because it's redundant and I'm sure I'm sure you hate that amazing gave a love\""]
["06:38,800","06:43,740","\"Because I like redundant games I play sonic, but the thing is like\""]
["06:43,740","06:48,980","\"The problem I have with breath of the wild and I don't really want to get in tangent because then I'll start hurting feelings\""]
["06:48,980","06:54,820","\"But like I'll cry I would actually cry in front of you. I genuinely hold on. I gotta pay to say this game is visually beautiful\""]
["06:54,820","06:57,980","\"I know it's awesome. I'm in heaven. I'm in heaven\""]
["06:57,980","07:03,020","\"That was bad. I didn't mean to do that. I gotta pay attention\""]
["07:03,020","07:07,120","\"Were you both meaning to sing to the song properly? No, I fucked up. That's what happens\""]
["07:07,120","07:11,420","\"It's like\""]
["07:11,420","07:16,220","\"That was a making a reference. I think the start of the green mile. He's in the old man's home\""]
["07:17,460","07:23,580","\"Don't you remember that was just sonic fucking turned around at the exact time that called for an OO in the song?\""]
["07:23,580","07:24,620","\"I guess\""]
["07:24,620","07:27,740","\"The only part of the grim all I really remember is the mouse\""]
["07:27,740","07:34,080","\"Traumatize I'm not even kidding is my hamster died. Oh, that happened so he stepped in the house\""]
["07:34,080","07:37,660","\"I was so mad that was the saddest fucking thing\""]
["07:37,660","07:43,300","\"I actually didn't affect me on a very deep love that movie even though it doesn't really mean anything\""]
["07:44,940","07:48,320","\"Doesn't need to be something could just be a guy revives a mouse with green\""]
["07:48,320","07:54,220","\"He blows fucking bugs out of his mouth. Yeah scariops out of his mouth into the mouse's body\""]
["07:54,220","08:01,220","\"Oh\""]
["08:01,220","08:07,260","\"Yeah, I I'm excited for sonic frontiers because it feels like Sega's doing something different\""]
["08:07,260","08:12,180","\"They've been playing it safe and forces with the culmination of playing away too safe and trying to make everybody happy\""]
["08:12,180","08:14,420","\"And that only ever makes everybody mad\""]
["08:14,420","08:22,720","\"So when they're doing something new while trying something similar like they're doing the generation style and people talk about asset using and it's like alright\""]
["08:22,720","08:25,240","\"People talk about complaining about fucking reusing assets\""]
["08:25,240","08:31,840","\"Don't even talk to me about that when Splatoon 3 is coming out with the same fucking story mode assets being used in all three fucking games\""]
["08:31,840","08:37,840","\"They don't talk to me about acid reusing okay. There's nothing wrong with reusing assets. It's how you go about it\""]
["08:37,840","08:41,800","\"You can reuse assets and repurpose stuff. I don't like the fact that they're reusing stuff\""]
["08:41,800","08:47,720","\"But at the same time I understand why they are because they had this stuff around and they're like we want to add more to the game\""]
["08:47,720","08:51,480","\"They had this big open world and they wanted to add a little more to it\""]
["08:51,480","08:55,680","\"So that's why they did it doesn't bother me as long as it's done well and to me it looks fun\""]
["08:55,680","08:59,840","\"Cory and that's all I care about if they took a crate from Dark Souls one\""]
["08:59,840","09:03,600","\"And used it in bloodborne. I would think I would give it a one out of ten\""]
["09:03,600","09:11,760","\"They fucking used one of those panels that is one of the most fart-smelling critiques you can get\""]
["09:11,760","09:16,060","\"That is like so I found that they reused a thing from you\""]
["09:16,060","09:24,720","\"To realize how many games are repurposed. I'm pretty sure Mario Odyssey wouldn't have exist if it wasn't for breath of the wild\""]
["09:24,720","09:31,440","\"Because I'm pretty sure it uses the same fucking like stamina thing because that little bar when Mario swimming is the exact same as\""]
["09:38,400","09:40,400","\"I guaranteed it for game engine\""]
["09:40,400","09:45,420","\"Guaranteed they repurposed Lincoln like gave him like red and blue overalls in the hat. No\""]
["09:45,420","09:53,220","\"I'm not being facetious. I'm serious. I guarantee they reuse stuff for because how the fucking they do\""]
["09:53,220","09:56,520","\"No time what's a matter fistfight?\""]
["09:56,520","10:01,920","\"No, we had an engine with breath of the wild and they've repurposed stuff from over the years\""]
["10:02,920","10:07,440","\"Fight with no weapons with Mario or Zelt Lake waited a fight Mario or Lincoln a fist fight\""]
["10:07,440","10:09,760","\"Well, you can play smash and find out\""]
["10:09,760","10:15,160","\"Video game because the league's got a sort of that I'm saying like outside of a bar. Oh\""]
["10:15,160","10:20,260","\"Yeah, this game is awesome. Yeah, you could be like a sure\""]
["10:20,260","10:26,580","\"Really good now that there's no dumbass cutscenes. How's that? It's good whoops?\""]
["10:26,580","10:29,600","\"Kill the blue blur\""]

["22:43,460","22:44,460","\"That was bad.\""]
["22:44,460","22:46,460","\"Your demise is so close.\""]
["22:46,460","22:51,460","\"Then you only might even be like what coined the phrase monster of the week, but I'm not sure.\""]
["22:51,460","22:52,460","\"I would be surprised.\""]
["22:52,460","22:53,460","\"No, I do like those shows.\""]

["22:59,460","23:03,460","\"Cory, if you could live in any Sonic zone, where would you live?\""]

["23:05,460","23:08,460","\"Ooh, something cool that I would like.\""]
["23:08,460","23:09,460","\"I probably enjoy it.\""]
["23:09,460","23:10,460","\"Brian Hill's own.\""]

["23:15,460","23:21,420","\"Don't like that it becomes like a fucking Australian forest fire once in a while. What about the gray bugs the gray box\""]
["23:21,420","23:23,420","\"No, I don't want to live near oil ocean\""]
["23:23,420","23:27,300","\"It's oil is that the dad a\""]

["23:43,340","23:48,340","\"When did they start to understand where you don't lose all your coins when you get hit?\""]
["23:48,340","23:49,740","\"Oh, you didn't even notice.\""]
["23:49,740","23:51,540","\"You didn't in shadow either, I noticed.\""]
["23:51,540","23:53,580","\"Yeah, that was kind of weird.\""]
["23:53,580","23:54,580","\"That's always been the thing.\""]

["24:00,540","24:03,540","\"I don't know, but I don't really care because losing rings sucks.\""]
["24:03,540","24:04,940","\"I guess that's true.\""]
["24:04,940","24:07,280","\"I mean you don't want to but sometimes it just happens.\""]
["24:07,280","24:09,640","\"That's the risk versus reward challenge.\""]
["24:09,640","24:11,480","\"Losing little rings doesn't really bother me.\""]
["24:11,480","24:13,640","\"I'd rather lose a little bit than all of them.\""]
["24:13,640","24:17,460","\"Actually what would be better is if they had a mode that was like hard mode\""]
["24:17,460","24:20,480","\"and your rings just fucking disappeared so you had to beat it without getting hit.\""]
["24:20,480","24:21,080","\"That would be interesting.\""]
["24:21,080","24:23,120","\"That's the opposite of what you just said you liked.\""]
["24:23,120","24:25,420","\"Yeah but that is built on a challenge.\""]
["24:25,420","24:26,460","\"That's not the game.\""]
["24:26,460","24:28,640","\"If the game itself was that it wouldn't be very fun.\""]
["24:28,640","24:30,560","\"But if it was like a mode then that's fine.\""]
["24:30,560","24:32,160","\"I guess.\""]
["24:32,160","24:33,660","\"I don't know.\""]

["24:34,660","25:04,620","\"I did being weird. Okay. Oh, no. All right. I guess we're just going to we're just going to name calling then. I'm not named calling nasty territory. I'm not name calling. It's been a truly nasty week for you. It has this. This is Cory's big, this is this is a good nasty week. This is my big nasty return. This is what I was trying to say like the green pillars that fall and Sonic 3. The dark core size your hand. Agreed pill. What on absolute earth. Would you agree? Bill Corey?\""]
["25:04,620","25:06,980","\"A green one a green pill would you eat a green pill?\""]

["25:15,540","25:19,340","\"Well now he wants it well, let's just say it's my poop\""]
["25:19,340","25:24,140","\"Let's just say it's my greed poop after anything plants that he grows more\""]
["25:24,140","25:27,740","\"Now do you know what you Chris just said there Corey? Yeah\""]
["25:27,740","25:33,340","\"What he said he plants his shit. It's a little fable. You know the fable is no\""]
["25:33,900","26:00,900","\"The game Chris law. Why don't you explain the Corey here? What old fable is a fable? You have to eat Zach's poop. Yep. Yep a fable is something that's brought down from generations and generations. Nope. No, that's a misconception. It's a misconception. Every the reason why they call the fable is because they're written stables and what happens in a stable. The horses eat the poop horses. She's bored horses. She piggy. This seems more like a what came first the chicken or the egg. Yeah, well the poop came first.\""]
