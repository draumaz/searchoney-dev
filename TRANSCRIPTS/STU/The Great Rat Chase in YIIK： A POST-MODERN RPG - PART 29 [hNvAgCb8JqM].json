["03:38,840","03:43,040","\"This is at least an interesting sequence\""]
["03:43,040","03:52,320","\"It's still happening plenty, but there's been less moments where I'm frustrated by the verbose verbosity or verbosity\""]
["03:52,320","03:54,320","\"I guess it's verbose of me to say that\""]

["05:01,500","05:03,500","\"They're like 12.\""]
["05:03,500","05:06,500","\"Probably close the door so that no security doesn't see you.\""]
["05:06,500","05:10,500","\"Sorry, but violence is just not the answer, so I don't agree with Bella on this at all.\""]
["05:10,500","05:12,500","\"I'm actually kind of upset looking at it.\""]
["05:12,500","05:15,500","\"What would your solution to this problem be?\""]
["05:15,500","05:16,500","\"Go to their parents.\""]

["06:36,300","06:37,200","\"Let's do this.\""]
["06:37,200","06:39,000","\"Listen to these sick beats.\""]

["06:50,380","06:52,620","\"Getting past two cycles is- is good.\""]
["06:52,620","06:53,120","\"Okay.\""]
["06:53,120","06:54,120","\"Are they protected by something?\""]
["06:54,120","06:55,860","\"So what do you do about that?\""]
["06:55,860","06:56,860","\"I don't know.\""]
["06:56,860","06:58,780","\"Is there an item that un- protects people?\""]

["07:08,800","07:12,360","\"You know, if only I could have read the text it said.\""]
["07:12,360","07:16,800","\"I only saw the word protected. I have no idea what else it said\""]
["07:16,800","07:21,480","\"Could it be that they want you to use Michael so that it can inflict status on him instead?\""]
["07:21,480","07:26,640","\"We go says they're protected by some unknown force. I don't I have no idea what that means\""]
["07:26,640","07:31,640","\"Maybe status can affect it. Maybe it's just not physical. This apparently is doing something\""]
["07:40,600","07:46,200","\"You're getting better at this mini game Chris. You don't get hit as much. He's gonna try you best. Oh come on\""]
["07:46,200","07:49,200","\"Me and my big mouth\""]
["07:49,200","07:50,920","\"It wasn't fair\""]
["07:50,920","07:57,240","\"Why do you think it controls that way that like eats your inputs and doesn't do anything because he didn't add any buffering to it?\""]
["07:57,240","07:58,920","\"It's really weird\""]
["07:58,920","08:01,480","\"Well, yeah, cool. I can't do anything now, so\""]
["08:01,480","08:10,360","\"It's got somebody's skill has to be able to remove it or like get around I think banish might have been the right choice\""]
["08:10,360","08:16,620","\"That's what I I would have guessed because that just killed my panda they had an entity there\""]
["08:16,620","08:18,780","\"So no pandas only up for two turns\""]
["08:18,780","08:23,880","\"And a panda dies you can't use them anymore in the fight oh\""]

["08:30,660","08:37,140","\"Is that what you like him for I like his voice is so friendly and cheerful and he's really sarcastic\""]
["08:38,780","08:40,900","\"It's very charming as a character to me\""]
["08:40,900","08:46,780","\"You fuck you think okay, let's see if it works or if it just does nothing\""]
["08:46,780","08:50,940","\"Hey, yes, I knew it okay good job\""]
["08:50,940","08:55,060","\"Thank you\""]

["09:40,820","09:42,820","\"They wouldn't ask you to help them with some...\""]
["09:42,820","09:45,820","\"No, Vella, you could have referenced a specific Saturday morning cartoon.\""]
["09:45,820","09:47,820","\"Like, kept in the plan.\""]
["09:47,820","09:49,820","\"It's the 1990s. Yeah.\""]
["09:49,820","09:54,820","\"I'm gonna go ahead and assume you just picked up the keys and carry them around pretending to be its evil minions.\""]
