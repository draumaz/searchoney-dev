04:24,840;04:26,840;"Yeah, the fabric guy with the giant vacuum arm."
04:26,840;04:28,840;"It was the president he did that."
04:28,840;04:35,840;"And he was like, ""Ah, this was one small step away from Taft or whoever sent me here."""
04:35,840;04:36,840;"Thanks."

05:27,380;05:30,520;"*coughing*"
05:30,520;05:31,600;"Are we collecting?"
05:31,600;05:32,900;"-Weee! -Which logo?"
05:32,900;05:34,860;"That's just what we do. We collect, man."
05:34,860;05:36,860;"We just hoard."
05:36,860;05:40,000;"It's an admirable trait in video games."
05:40,000;05:43,900;"So much on the like, real life, where if I hoard, people yell at me and have interventions."
05:43,900;05:45,340;"You're getting a high"
05:45,340;05:49,360;"out of thinking that you've got sequel matter in your food."
05:49,360;05:52,360;"It's my last, it's my last blaze of glory."
05:52,360;05:54,120;"Do you remember a little big planet?"
05:54,120;05:57,420;"Those were the days before all this."
05:57,420;06:00,780;"That was like a really overhyped thing that wasn't actually that great."
06:00,780;06:05,840;"Yeah, I was gonna say they made a big deal about it and they put a lot of effort into it and I never really thought it was fun."
06:05,840;06:10,740;"I think it was supposed to be like their big like Mario killer, I think, was the idea."
06:10,740;06:14,380;"I thought it was like a Mario Maker type game even before Mario Maker."
06:14,380;06:19,180;"Wait, before that was a thing. I mean that was the idea right where they were like people who make their own fun."
06:19,180;06:22,360;"I don't know if it predated Minecraft or not, but it was definitely..."
06:22,360;06:23,660;"Oh, I'm pretty sure it did."
06:23,660;06:27,260;"Definitely like around the same arrow where they were like oh let's give"
06:27,260;06:32,380;"Infinite levels if you keep tapping circle if you can do what the fuck happened"
06:32,380;06:40,420;"You can get on me. Yeah, I just what you can just roll on your buddy. Yeah, let me try. It's pretty cool. They look at me go I"
06:40,420;06:46,660;"Feel like these games. Oh, you got it. You got a jump from dude to dude. Okay"
06:46,660;06:50,500;"All right, this might this might be the best game of her play"
06:50,500;06:53,380;"Okay, we go"
06:53,380;06:55,380;"Yes"
06:55,380;06:58,820;"It's actually pretty sick. Yeah"
06:58,820;07:03,100;"He wants me to get it. Let's see how long till the novelty way is right"
07:03,100;07:07,860;"Yeah, I mean that's true these games are always like way way better with other people though. Oh for sure"
07:07,860;07:12,500;"But what did I get I get a new costume piece? What I want that?"
07:12,500;07:19,100;"I think it's I have no idea. Hey, you even wear the costumes. Oh, you can probably customize your thing"
07:19,940;07:24,780;"I'm sure it'll teach us in time. Is that a cloud? Can I fuck that up? Oh?"
07:24,780;07:29,320;"Hey, wait, how'd you do that? I jumped to press triangle. Oh, I"
07:29,320;07:35,620;"Don't know what triangle does otherwise, but if you press it in midair you yeah, it's like it's like a it's like a face dive"
07:35,620;07:43,180;"Wait, is there way up? Oh, okay. How'd you do that? Just it just bounces you like a bouncer there. Okay? Oh"
07:43,180;07:47,580;"We better collect all the things"
07:48,780;07:56,700;"They're obviously integral. Yeah, no, I'm just habitually collecting shit because my stupid video game at old brain is like this is shiny"
07:56,700;07:59,740;"I better go for it, but I have no idea what the value of any of it is"
07:59,740;08:05,700;"I just assume that it has value and that's half the journey Tomar is I'm watching a number tick up"
08:05,700;08:09,140;"Oh my freaking second"
08:09,140;08:12,580;"You might as well just play a clicker game I"
08:12,580;08:17,560;"Know I know if you play that cookie clicker game that game is"
08:17,820;08:23,620;"I recommend that anybody that wants to get acquainted with actually how stupid they are. Just play that game"
08:23,620;08:29,180;"That's gonna fucking mean me. Yeah, I mean it's true, right? Like you don't realize like how"
08:29,180;08:34,860;"Susceptible your stupid lizard brain is just watching a number. Click up. I know I am look"
08:34,860;08:38,460;"I've played enough clicker games. I there's even bigger games. I still"
08:38,460;08:45,660;"Occasionally play just like when I'm bored and I and I can't be bothered to get invested in something"
08:45,660;08:50,820;"I think the interesting thing about cookie clicker is it doesn't even have the pretense of being good"
08:50,820;08:56,400;"Like it's just like it's a cookie click it you dumb asshole and then you do it and then it's like okay"
08:56,400;09:02,240;"You saw the number move now you're addicted and it's just like I thought I thought cookie at least the cookie clicker"
09:02,240;09:07,080;"I remember playing I felt like you got all the content you needed within like an hour anyway"
09:07,080;09:13,320;"Well, yeah, I mean that's kind of the point though is like I feel like a lot of games try to build themselves on cookie clicker"
09:13,320;09:16,700;"and people are like, ""I'm having fun with this, but you're not really having fun with it."""
09:16,700;09:18,960;"It's just like, cookie clicker, you know what I mean?"
09:18,960;09:20,440;"It's scarlet."
09:20,440;09:22,160;"I don't like her. Not one bit."
09:22,160;09:24,080;"Pure creative energies."
09:24,080;09:28,520;"I lost this eye in a great war. I've seen much death."
09:28,520;09:31,560;"Now go to the Humblgum Junction."
09:31,560;09:35,600;"Yes, they gouged it. Yes, you heard."
09:35,600;09:37,680;"But magical adventure awaits."
09:37,680;09:41,400;"I have family talks to Chris' sack and our sacks just disappear."
09:41,400;09:46,680;"Wait off camera because our sacks are shorn and underneath the circumcised dick"
09:46,680;09:50,160;"To be like acknowledge you have to be a brown hairy sack"
09:50,160;09:56,240;"Green sacks need not apply I see or shiny"
09:56,240;09:59,320;"And white sacks are"
09:59,320;10:03,240;"Too afraid to speak up for fear of being perceived a certain way"
10:03,240;10:08,120;"If she was real I pick out her hair individually. I'd feed her worms"
10:09,640;10:11,640;"Diabrow"
10:11,640;10:16,680;"Now she's dead now. I'm glad full me guys. I know what we're doing. Oh"
10:16,680;10:20,160;"This is just like you know, they would be plenty"
10:20,160;10:26,160;"Ye
