["12:25,520","12:32,160","\"You can't get some hits on him you just got to watch out I suppose\""]
["12:32,940","12:36,700","\"There's just certain things. I don't know how to dodge you'll figure it all out\""]
["12:36,700","12:42,500","\"He's got a pretty broad moves set, but it's still you'll you'll learn it all eventually\""]
["12:42,500","12:50,020","\"He's got I I could complain up and down the wall about this guy. He's got a few things that I kind of I'm like really\""]

["12:53,540","13:00,140","\"Which all right, which is kind of pissing me out really is just about knowing the timing and dodging it\""]
["13:00,140","13:06,300","\"Is that just the one-hit kill no no just a nasty nasty hit nasty oh nasty\""]
["13:06,300","13:10,340","\"I'm gonna try that again. I have heard that the jellyfish works really well against him\""]

["13:14,520","13:17,680","\"But it does feel a little bit like cheating I\""]
["13:17,680","13:22,780","\"Did it on a like a second character because I just didn't want to deal with him again\""]
["13:22,780","13:24,780","\"And yeah, it does fucking destroy him\""]

["13:35,940","13:37,940","\"Yeah, he's got a few that are like good openings.\""]
["13:37,940","13:40,740","\"The move where he jumps at you is a good opening if you roll into it.\""]
["13:40,740","13:42,780","\"Oh yeah, the lower he jumps and stabs down.\""]
["13:42,780","13:44,100","\"Even that one where he's...\""]

["13:48,660","13:50,740","\"No, the jumping one's always pretty safe.\""]
["13:50,740","13:53,020","\"Okay.\""]
