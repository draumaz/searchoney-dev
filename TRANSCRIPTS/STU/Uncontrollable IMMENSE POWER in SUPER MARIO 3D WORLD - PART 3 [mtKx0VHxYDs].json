["03:50,480","03:52,760","\"That's you now, that little yellow horrid thing.\""]
["03:52,760","03:55,480","\"I don't want to be part of this stupid elitist party anyway.\""]
["03:55,480","03:57,360","\"Oh, look at that little guy.\""]
["03:57,360","03:59,800","\"Yeah, we got a sticker of him after we beat his ass.\""]
["03:59,800","04:02,920","\"I'm going to put a sticker over my ass, so I never have to shoot again.\""]
["04:02,920","04:07,680","\"Imagine an incident in which a child beat up their fellow kindergartners\""]
["04:07,680","04:10,240","\"and when asked why they replied,\""]
["04:10,240","04:12,680","\"they thought they were going to get a cool sticker of their friend.\""]
["04:12,680","04:13,760","\"Or maybe they did.\""]
["04:13,760","04:18,920","\"They got a sticker of their friend and then put it on their friend's mutilated body.\""]
["04:19,160","04:21,740","\"And it's like, look, one is upon the other.\""]
["04:21,740","04:22,580","\"That's a, you know what?\""]
["04:22,580","04:25,100","\"You guys have a really great idea sometimes.\""]
["04:25,100","04:27,020","\"It'd be cool if there was a teacher out there\""]
["04:27,020","04:30,460","\"who made really detailed stickers of all of their children.\""]
["04:30,460","04:33,660","\"- Just to give them the students one beats up the other.\""]
["04:33,660","04:34,860","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:34,860","04:36,980","\"- No, not for that, but just in general.\""]
["04:36,980","04:39,540","\"It's like, you get a Mikey sticker.\""]
["04:39,540","04:40,380","\"It's like, why?\""]
["04:40,380","04:41,220","\"I don't like Mikey.\""]
["04:41,220","04:43,020","\"- Yeah, she should rank them at the beginning\""]
["04:43,020","04:45,540","\"and that'll be their numerical value.\""]
["04:45,540","04:46,780","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:46,780","04:49,180","\"She puts way too much value in one student.\""]
["04:49,180","04:52,940","\"That would mess with kids' minds so hard.\""]
["04:52,940","04:53,420","\"Yeah, you have to--\""]
["04:53,420","04:54,380","\"Sure would.\""]
["04:54,380","04:57,340","\"If you beat one up, it changes the value of their sticker,\""]
["04:57,340","04:58,980","\"so there's a whole system.\""]
["04:58,980","04:59,480","\"No.\""]
["04:59,480","05:03,260","\"And that would actually rot at child's mind,\""]
["05:03,260","05:06,660","\"because there would be no fucking logic nor reason.\""]
["05:06,660","05:09,100","\"I mean, I think we've established a pretty detailed\""]
["05:09,100","05:10,900","\"and fair system.\""]
["05:10,900","05:15,260","\"If a child can't handle it, then maybe they don't get a sticker.\""]
["05:15,260","05:15,760","\"Sounds like a child problem.\""]
["05:15,760","05:19,060","\"They would definitely fuck them up even more if the stickers were super polished in high\""]
["05:19,060","05:20,060","\"quality.\""]
["05:20,060","05:21,560","\"Like they look, they're really good art.\""]
["05:21,560","05:22,560","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:22,560","05:25,320","\"Like a cool big one.\""]
["05:25,320","05:29,760","\"The amount of mental anguish those suffer is exactly.\""]
["05:29,760","05:32,960","\"Yeah, it would entirely correlate to how good the heart is.\""]
["05:32,960","05:34,520","\"How good the art looked.\""]
["05:34,520","05:39,200","\"And there'd be like a like shiny thomas, shiny McCulcan.\""]
["05:39,200","05:40,200","\"Shiny McCulcan.\""]
["05:40,200","05:41,200","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:41,200","05:42,200","\"Oh no.\""]
["05:42,200","05:43,200","\"You like McCulcan.\""]
["05:43,200","05:44,400","\"I got a step I can do.\""]
["05:44,400","05:45,240","\"- You like my colleague?\""]
["05:45,240","05:46,680","\"Like my colleague, how can I do that\""]
["05:46,680","05:47,600","\"where you're thinking of?\""]
["05:47,600","05:49,840","\"- Yeah, yeah, that's right.\""]
["05:49,840","05:53,400","\"Let me add to this freaking plate, there we go.\""]
["05:53,400","05:57,000","\"Stupid, by skating Google, I wanna be in that.\""]
["05:57,000","06:00,800","\"Yeah, this rocks, life is not horrible.\""]
["06:00,800","06:02,400","\"- You're a shoe, man.\""]
["06:02,400","06:03,720","\"- I am a shoe.\""]
["06:03,720","06:07,000","\"- What kind of fucking smurf mobile is that?\""]
["06:07,000","06:07,880","\"- It's a toilet.\""]
["06:07,880","06:11,280","\"- Well, anything's a toilet if you try hard enough.\""]
["06:12,560","06:17,200","\"my bedroom. Fuck you Goomba, you can't kill. Look, you guys can have one too now.\""]
["06:17,200","06:21,680","\"It's cool how when you jump on ice you do a little like like a little twirl.\""]
["06:21,680","06:24,560","\"Oh well I fucked it immediately. You just threw it into that ring.\""]
["06:24,560","06:28,560","\"What the hell did you do that for? I crashed. I can get this. See, I'm doing pretty good now.\""]
["06:28,560","06:33,840","\"It's like that movie Crash and I made that that woman horny. Bandicoot? Yeah. Well no,\""]
["06:33,840","06:37,200","\"she did want to fuck a bandicoot but that's a different thing. Wait no, he's crashed the one\""]
["06:37,200","06:39,200","\"What's going on?\""]
["06:39,200","06:48,200","\"No, no, that's crank crashes crashes a movie that like won an Oscar and it's just about like a woman that gets horny when she sees car crashes. I\""]
["06:48,200","06:50,840","\"Think that's normal\""]
["06:50,840","06:52,440","\"probably\""]
["06:52,440","06:56,760","\"So people get horny just from seeing door and it's not me and I'm not looking right into the camera\""]
["06:56,760","07:04,280","\"I will say it is satisfying to see like an especially bad car crash when you're like stuck in traffic\""]
["07:05,720","07:07,720","\"What's wrong with you? No, it's not.\""]
["07:07,720","07:10,720","\"No, like at the end of it, you're like, \"\"Ah, at least.\"\"\""]
["07:10,720","07:11,720","\"It's not me.\""]
["07:11,720","07:13,720","\"It's something not boring happened.\""]
["07:13,720","07:18,720","\"If it's like a shitty little fender bender, it's like, \"\"Fuck you.\"\"\""]
["07:18,720","07:21,720","\"But if you see one of those little family stickers,\""]
["07:21,720","07:25,720","\"and there's like eight people on it, and there's this minivan collapsed into itself,\""]
["07:25,720","07:26,720","\"you're like, \"\"Okay.\"\"\""]
["07:26,720","07:31,720","\"All right, that was a good sacrifice to the universe to fucking make me late for work.\""]
["07:31,720","07:34,720","\"Did you hear about the car crash where the guy crashed his car so hard\""]
["07:34,720","07:41,020","\"so hard his head got blown off of his body and landed in another car in front of him next to the guy in the seat\""]
["07:41,020","07:43,420","\"And he looked horrible. Yeah, no, it didn't happen\""]
["07:43,420","07:51,960","\"No, there is an actual story kind of like that Tomar see see what Tomar does when he's got a pro controller\""]
["07:51,960","07:53,960","\"Instead of a game-cute\""]
["07:53,960","07:57,920","\"Tomar so good. I knew you're good. But yeah, anyway\""]
["07:57,920","08:04,080","\"No, there was actually a story where something kind of similar that to that happened and the guy fused consciousness is with the car\""]
["08:04,080","08:06,080","\"*laughs*\""]
["08:06,080","08:08,640","\"His head landed on the exhaust.\""]
["08:08,640","08:11,140","\"Let's go to that Bowser statue thing. What's that do?\""]
["08:11,140","08:15,720","\"And then it was like that car was like someone's dad and then that kid was like\""]
["08:15,720","08:19,960","\"\"\"I'm gonna live with my dad forever\"\" and he kept that car for as long as he could but then...\""]
["08:19,960","08:21,160","\"Oh, it just didn't end up.\""]
["08:21,160","08:23,160","\"It's like the movie Jack Frost, but with a car?\""]
["08:23,160","08:31,760","\"Yeah, but then planned obsolescence happened and they stopped making like rotor belts for it and the kids dad inevitably had to be scrapped.\""]
["08:31,760","08:32,760","\"That's really fucking sad.\""]
["08:32,760","08:33,760","\"Oh no!\""]
["08:33,760","08:36,760","\"When shit goes out of commission like that, it's the most annoying thing.\""]
["08:36,760","08:37,760","\"Dude, yeah.\""]
["08:37,760","08:38,760","\"I was trying to buy a thing.\""]
["08:38,760","08:39,760","\"Who was that Bill?\""]
["08:39,760","08:42,760","\"I was trying to buy...well actually, I wasn't going to buy it because it was too expensive,\""]
["08:42,760","08:46,760","\"but I was looking to buy a seaboard piano, you know those things?\""]
["08:46,760","08:48,760","\"What is a seaboard?\""]
["08:48,760","08:52,760","\"It's a piano that has squishy keys, so you can do vibrato and pitch banding and stuff.\""]
["08:52,760","08:53,760","\"Oh!\""]
["08:53,760","08:56,760","\"And they discontinued the full keyboard.\""]
["08:56,760","08:57,760","\"Oh, that sucks.\""]
["08:57,760","09:00,760","\"So they don't do 8, they don't do 88 keys?\""]
["09:00,760","09:01,760","\"Nope.\""]
["09:01,760","09:02,760","\"It's just 48 now.\""]
["09:02,760","09:09,120","\"And any pianist would know that's fucking shit cuz everyone wants an 88. Oh, no\""]
["09:09,120","09:12,360","\"Sorry, no, how do you know?\""]
["09:12,360","09:19,100","\"Regenerates did you know that I'm actually like really really amazing at piano. Did you know that?\""]

["09:42,600","09:48,960","\"What does that entail? What is the scale entail? You have to hit all 88 keys within one second?\""]
["09:48,960","09:55,200","\"So you just mash your arm across the piano basically no no no it's very difficult only I can do it\""]
["09:56,640","10:03,860","\"Sorry, I was just really into that fact. Yeah, see fucking I actually really dislike levels like this where the camera just moves\""]
["10:03,860","10:10,280","\"Consistently yeah me too. I'm not a fan. Oh, but you know what what it's called variety\""]
["10:10,280","10:13,800","\"Sometimes you have to do something shit for right. No, you're right\""]
