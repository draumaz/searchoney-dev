["00:05,900","00:08,400","\"I thought you had to buy every individual game and then install it.\""]
["00:08,400","00:10,200","\"No, you nasty idiot.\""]
["00:10,200","00:11,000","\"Oh.\""]

["00:58,380","01:01,040","\"You're like most people who like it only like it because of the music.\""]
["01:01,040","01:02,540","\"This is the weird funkiness of it.\""]
["01:02,540","01:04,500","\"Or you know what I'd maybe compare it to?\""]
["01:04,500","01:07,600","\"Did you ever play that goof troop game for the Super Nintendo?\""]

["01:42,460","01:43,460","\"Once again is correct.\""]

["01:44,460","01:45,460","\"Look, we don't have any games.\""]
["01:45,460","01:46,460","\"You do need to buy the games.\""]
["01:46,460","01:49,460","\"I told you we had to buy all the games and then install it as DLC.\""]
["01:49,460","01:50,460","\"Are you sure?\""]
["01:50,460","01:51,460","\"I'm pretty sure.\""]

["02:14,980","02:17,140","\"We need to bring it.\""]
["02:17,140","02:18,420","\"I love this game.\""]
["02:18,420","02:22,020","\"I haven't played in a while, so how long has that love been there?\""]
["02:22,020","02:24,420","\"Wait, who the fuck's that orange idiot?\""]
["02:24,420","02:25,540","\"It's Knuckles.\""]
["02:25,540","02:30,360","\"Okay, can I just say I never played this one as a kid. I only played one which is the worst one apparently\""]
["02:30,360","02:37,020","\"But everyone knows this fucking song a little laggy is it yeah, I also like this like virtual\""]
["02:37,020","02:43,700","\"Wall the grid the second grid. I love that thing. It's crazy. We see feel like I'm actually inside the TV\""]
["02:43,700","02:50,360","\"Yeah, but don't go beyond it. Is it actually laggy in what way? It's just a little laggy. Oh, it's probably the emuletor\""]
["02:50,360","02:52,360","\"I only get this little shoe here\""]
["02:53,500","02:58,020","\"When I hit the spring okay, I just want to make a joke like like when he gets that shoe\""]
["02:58,020","03:01,660","\"It's almost like he's he's on cracker speed. Yeah, that's really true\""]
["03:01,660","03:07,700","\"It's almost like he's doing some kind of like hardcore like illegal drug of some sort that that is inherently just a hilarious\""]
["03:07,700","03:09,700","\"concept I just tried to drop that\""]
["03:09,700","03:15,360","\"No, but you know, I'm kind of glad I never played this as a kid because it would have like\""]
["03:15,360","03:21,300","\"Unleashed my full autism. I love this game. This would have gotten me absolutely hugged forever\""]
["03:21,540","03:26,220","\"Yeah, I beat it so many times actually what's funny is this game's kind of ruthless for the last boss\""]
["03:26,220","03:32,820","\"Yeah, kind of like throws you at the wolves and then the wolves eat the remains because it's like they expect a lot from you\""]
["03:32,820","03:36,340","\"As a kid towards the end because you're kind of like they kind of like\""]
["03:36,340","03:42,100","\"Once you get to it, you're like I can do anything I can take on the world and then they remove your source of life\""]
["03:42,100","03:46,680","\"They're like oh you need rings. We'll be sure to make you fight two bosses and then fucking\""]
["03:46,680","03:49,900","\"Have fun with no rings. So as a kid you're like\""]
["03:50,380","03:52,380","\"Your heart's breathing\""]
["03:52,380","04:04,820","\"This game's awesome also Chris I don't think that this would have like unlocked your full potential of I\""]
["04:04,820","04:10,980","\"Don't think these are the games that do it because these are just whatever that I think this is the game that did it to\""]
["04:10,980","04:18,380","\"Most people no, I think it's more the later ones where sonic starts like fighting the military and characters start like giving speeches about\""]
["04:19,580","04:24,600","\"I don't think that happens until like kind of the sonic adventure era where they're they tried to be like\""]
["04:24,600","04:27,360","\"Sonic is cool. Sonic is\""]
["04:27,360","04:32,280","\"Sonic is what saves the world sonic sonic fights wars\""]
["04:32,280","04:35,260","\"Yes, you're right, but no, I think this is still the game\""]
["04:35,260","04:38,960","\"So okay, there's the thing about sonic one is everyone wants to like sonic\""]
["04:38,960","04:43,760","\"But it's sonic one is so boring and shit that no one ever actually really completes it that much\""]
["04:43,760","04:45,600","\"Yeah, sonic one is boring most kids\""]
["04:45,600","04:48,080","\"I know never beat sonic one because it's just so shit to get through\""]
["04:48,320","04:53,900","\"Sonic one was like a test and most people agree like they play the first level of sonic one and they're like I love\""]
["04:53,900","04:56,440","\"Yeah, yeah, so yeah green hills. I love green hills green\""]
["04:56,440","05:00,200","\"Hill then the next level you're like this sucks and then that whole the whole rest of the game is like this sucks\""]
["05:00,200","05:04,280","\"Okay, Corey dr. Robotnik is he deep down a good guy?\""]
["05:04,280","05:09,160","\"No, he's an asshole well, then how come it's Sonic adventure - at the end of the game? He seems like a good guy\""]
["05:09,160","05:12,360","\"It's all rude they do that a couple times actually\""]
["05:13,000","05:19,760","\"That happens in the first Sonic adventure - he's like I promise I will never be a dick again and then he's immediately a dick again\""]
["05:19,760","05:22,560","\"Yeah, he goes and they got a fucking trusty thing\""]
["05:22,560","05:28,600","\"Tails goes to shake his hand and pulls a gun on him and says nobody follow me\""]
["05:28,600","05:36,400","\"Was uh was the spin dash in Sonic 1 I know sort of came in this game. Yeah, what is this one? Yeah?\""]
["05:36,400","05:42,480","\"Yeah, this isn't that's what and that's a thing too is like momentum in Sonic 1 was really like it was all trial and error\""]
["05:42,480","05:47,180","\"I think what I was trying to say before is like Sonic one started out you do the first level and you're really into it\""]
["05:47,180","05:49,820","\"Sorry for me rolling all the time. It's a habit anytime. I see like a\""]
["05:49,820","05:58,100","\"Thing anyone who plays Sonic games knows that once you see a hail you instinctively roll. It's like it's it's what everybody knows\""]
["05:58,100","06:02,900","\"But so like they did the first level and then they were like we don't want to like wear everybody out\""]
["06:02,900","06:05,340","\"We give them like an endorphin thing and then they're ready to go\""]
["06:05,340","06:10,260","\"So let's slow it down to a crawl with the next level where you have to wait for blocks over lava\""]
["06:10,260","06:15,860","\"And then they pick it up again because you do the casino stage. Yeah, and then it's the worst stage ever labyrinth zone and\""]
["06:15,860","06:20,780","\"Then you stop playing the game because you hate it. Okay, that's fair\""]
["06:20,780","06:23,220","\"That's basically how you play Sonic the Hedgehog by the way\""]
["06:23,220","06:29,980","\"I'm not gonna become supersonic because then it would be annoying because I constantly jump jump and become supersonic because if you hold jump\""]
["06:29,980","06:35,780","\"Once you have 50 rings you become supersonic. There's like no way to do it and all the new games that come out\""]
["06:35,780","06:38,780","\"You have to press a button to instinctively do it. Okay. Well\""]
["06:39,540","06:44,140","\"Lyle yes my friend if you were to make a good sonic game. How would you do it?\""]
["06:44,140","06:49,580","\"Well the first thing it would start with a quote from bro broke Spinoza\""]
["06:49,580","07:01,340","\"Yeah, I think just like involving philosophy in Sonic would be a good idea sonic sonic would say what?\""]
["07:01,340","07:05,780","\"What does life even mean you look off into the distance and then and then\""]
["07:06,220","07:08,860","\"spoiler alert dark sonic right you just\""]
["07:08,860","07:11,860","\"are ripping off shadow this book but he's no no\""]
["07:11,860","07:15,100","\"this is not running this is not what he's evil okay\""]
["07:15,100","07:18,260","\"dark sonic because that's what's cool is when you see a\""]
["07:18,260","07:20,420","\"character and then there's another character that's exactly\""]
["07:20,420","07:22,820","\"like him everyone thinks dark sonic is sonic\""]
["07:22,820","07:26,340","\"all right this isn't shadow but it's dark sonic okay low\""]
["07:26,340","07:29,340","\"and the dark sonic yes you're Mary's Amy\""]
["07:29,340","07:33,780","\"and he has yeah he has my hair and Amy gets pregnant with\""]
["07:33,780","07:35,660","\"- The dark sonic's made me-- - Is he also on half tattoos?\""]
["07:35,660","07:36,500","\"- Yes.\""]
["07:36,500","07:37,820","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:37,820","07:39,160","\"- Was he a fan of Jack Daniel?\""]
["07:39,160","07:40,500","\"- Yes.\""]
["07:40,500","07:41,340","\"- Okay.\""]
["07:41,340","07:44,300","\"- And then dark sonic looks right at the camera\""]
["07:44,300","07:46,500","\"and says, \"\"Your dad was wrong about you.\"\"\""]
["07:46,500","07:48,300","\"And that's the video game.\""]
["07:48,300","07:49,140","\"- That's fucking awesome.\""]
["07:49,140","07:50,780","\"- He sucks him off when it's over.\""]
["07:50,780","07:51,940","\"- I knew that, that would be cool.\""]
["07:51,940","07:52,780","\"- No!\""]
["07:52,780","07:53,620","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:53,620","07:54,460","\"- Oh shit.\""]
["07:54,460","07:55,660","\"- He tails is dead now.\""]
["07:55,660","07:57,380","\"- You dropped him into purple acid.\""]
["07:57,380","07:58,220","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:58,220","07:59,300","\"- He's never gonna be the same.\""]
["07:59,300","08:00,620","\"- It's all right.\""]
["08:00,620","08:02,660","\"Kinda sucks as a character in this.\""]
["08:02,660","08:05,020","\"He's just sort of like a puppet that you school around.\""]
["08:05,020","08:06,300","\"Every time he comes in from flying,\""]
["08:06,300","08:08,180","\"he's usually falling to his death a second later.\""]
["08:08,180","08:09,980","\"- Well, he got out, but that probably took\""]
["08:09,980","08:12,220","\"like a year and a half off his lifespan.\""]
["08:12,220","08:13,060","\"- Yeah. - Of course.\""]
["08:13,060","08:14,700","\"- Of course, 53 is gonna go to the doctor\""]
["08:14,700","08:17,300","\"and find out he's got like heart issues 'cause of that.\""]
["08:17,300","08:18,140","\"- What's up?\""]
["08:18,140","08:20,980","\"- Cory, make a dorkly cartoon about Sonic right now.\""]
["08:20,980","08:22,020","\"- A dorkly cartoon?\""]
["08:22,020","08:22,940","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:22,940","08:24,900","\"- Okay, well, Tails is trying to be his friend\""]
["08:24,900","08:27,700","\"and he's just like, \"\"Tails, have you paid rent yet?\""]
["08:27,700","08:29,100","\"\"\"Is that kinda like how it is?\"\"\""]
["08:29,100","08:30,140","\"And then he's just like--\""]
["08:30,140","08:32,300","\"- Nah, you're missing the entire point of dorkly.\""]
["08:32,300","08:37,360","\"Actually, if I'm trying to think right dorkly they did sonic for hire. Yeah, I'm not sure actually\""]
["08:37,360","08:44,080","\"Sure it sure does seem the same you're right well if you want to know what they would do as a sonic parody look up sonic for hire\""]
["08:44,080","08:46,080","\"He basically that's all it was\""]
["08:46,080","08:54,300","\"I think now because machinima as a whole is gone. Yeah, they liquidated or clean still around no what dorkly does is that they'll take a\""]
["08:54,300","09:00,900","\"Really really obvious video game observation and be like tails can't die. It's on its own speed. Yeah\""]
["09:00,900","09:04,980","\"It'll be like that, but there was one episode where it's like oh tails you're dead\""]
["09:04,980","09:10,900","\"And then tails like actually I'm still alive what you're immortal and then the rest of the cartoon is about him being immortal\""]
["09:10,900","09:12,900","\"I mean that's a dorkly idea\""]
["09:12,900","09:18,420","\"That's the guy from the cartoon. Oh, yeah, except he's not green grounder. Yeah\""]
["09:18,420","09:21,580","\"Mm-hmm is the chicken in this scratch?\""]
["09:21,580","09:25,220","\"I don't think he is puppy\""]
["09:25,220","09:27,220","\"No, that's scrappy as he\""]
["09:28,180","09:34,360","\"Has he ever been in a Sonic game the chicken man? I don't know. He must have been I don't know\""]
["09:34,360","09:39,360","\"I don't think better of bid. I think it was not Corey was only for adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\""]
["09:39,360","09:44,040","\"This is the part by the way. You have to ride these things or else you'll be fucked. There's an easier way to do it\""]
["09:44,040","09:50,820","\"Dude grander was this Patrick star in a robot suit there. I skipped it. You really done it now Corey\""]
["09:50,820","09:55,740","\"This is the maximum Corey I wanted\""]
["09:56,320","10:03,760","\"This level's pretty I'll give it that music rocks. Oh no. Oh fuck. I love the first track that I\""]
["10:03,760","10:08,280","\"Bet when a Greek guy built this he wanted you to do this\""]
["10:08,280","10:18,420","\"Yeah, blue hedgehog will fly through here and then this column will fall right as he gets up to it\""]
["10:18,420","10:21,300","\"And then I learned to do my real native accent\""]
["10:21,300","10:23,300","\"I\""]
["10:23,300","10:30,980","\"Is\""]
["10:30,980","10:35,860","\"Like a dude a Greek person in a dove like the early 90s. Oh shit\""]
["10:35,860","10:39,980","\"Come on Eggman not wood and fucking support that\""]
["10:39,980","10:42,860","\"Eggman you're fucking stupid. Yeah\""]
["10:44,980","10:46,660","\"I build it up to you and support.\""]

["10:51,700","10:56,140","\"- Yeah, as far as inventions go, I think maybe stone pillars\""]

["19:02,900","19:09,540","\"It's true though. It's also fact the 90s died when friends went off the air which I believe was yeah like 2008\""]
["19:09,540","19:15,300","\"That's a good point, which is also probably not true. Basically the 90s wasn't dead while Scott was still popular\""]

["19:33,860","19:35,480","\"but I don't think it really has a place here\""]

["23:43,940","23:49,360","\"But for who dorkley they love it okay, what if we insulted them every step of the way\""]
["23:49,360","23:56,180","\"Do you think that they would honestly care do you think anyone at dorkley is sitting around like I'm so passionate about this\""]

["25:11,200","25:16,900","\"More than I like the stage. Okay. Wait, this is this is gonna. This is gonna sound really stupid\""]
["25:16,900","25:22,400","\"What it's how I truly feel I think a 2d doesn't really suit sonic very well\""]
["25:22,400","25:27,860","\"I thought actually do prefer it's on a 3d just because you can see where you're going it and when you're going fast\""]
["25:27,860","25:33,440","\"Well, if it's any consolation, that's what everybody's been wanting a holy 3d sonic game\""]

["25:44,660","25:49,320","\"I was just about to say that because you yeah if you can see further in front of you\""]
["25:49,320","25:56,440","\"It would be real cool and that's what mania did and also like the re-releases of sonic Wow good spot for a spike\""]

["25:59,120","26:04,280","\"I was kind of managed to hurt yourself on that stupidly\""]
["26:05,160","26:09,320","\"The thing I'm trying to look for these like there's like these circle things that shoot you around\""]
["26:09,320","26:12,840","\"It's level so long\""]
["26:12,840","26:19,160","\"So am I I hate these kind I don't I don't really like it in games when like you get in a bar like Donkey Kong\""]
["26:19,160","26:22,500","\"Like you just shoots you around and like there's no point. Yeah\""]
["26:22,500","26:29,920","\"Where it'll like it like yeah like over six barrels at a time. Yeah, it's just it's a spectacle for like five seconds\""]
["26:29,920","26:33,800","\"I guess I don't mind it. I think that that's fine. You know\""]
["26:33,800","26:36,160","\"Sometimes it's a deal or nothing. Sometimes it doesn't\""]
["26:36,160","26:42,960","\"Wow, yeah, the way you expect it to but I mean Sonic's always had that like the loop D loops in the shader completely pointless\""]

["26:44,960","26:48,920","\"But loop D loops are satisfying to go through\""]
["26:48,920","26:51,800","\"Yeah, it's really satisfying in 3d\""]
["26:51,800","26:57,560","\"I mean that that's what they're trying to do with that. I think they're like, oh look he's being shot through all these cannons\""]
["26:57,560","27:03,760","\"Yeah, I really like Sonic 2, but I felt like they mastered the sonic design in levels at Sonic 3 and Knuckles\""]
["27:03,760","27:07,760","\"You know we could have played that instead right?\""]
["27:07,760","27:12,460","\"No, no, I still want I still like Sonic 2. It's shorter. We should play that. Sonic 3 and Knuckles is a little longer\""]

["27:20,340","27:24,500","\"Let me ask you something. When do you think I first played Sonic 2 when you were?\""]
["27:24,500","27:33,220","\"Let me guess a bit because you're asking me this question. I'm gonna guess when you were 12 a little later\""]
["27:33,220","27:36,600","\"Oh, wow, you must feel like an idiot now\""]
["27:36,600","27:43,520","\"This course age when he played Sonic - you moron. Sorry core. Go ahead. No, it's fine\""]
["27:43,520","27:46,240","\"I was born in like 1990s\""]
["27:46,240","27:50,080","\"So people would have thought like oh you would have been all about Sonic is like as a kid little kid\""]
["27:50,080","27:52,520","\"I would have loved it, but I didn't play Sonic until\""]
["27:52,520","27:59,280","\"The PlayStation 2 was out Wow like I I didn't even have a Sega Genesis\""]
["27:59,280","28:05,420","\"This is around the time when owning like a console like that like you could get it for like 50 bucks and\""]

["28:08,620","28:12,820","\"Well, my parents just brought back this huge box full of Sega Genesis games and\""]
["28:12,820","28:16,620","\"Inside the box had a notebook that had codes\""]

["28:19,880","28:24,000","\"So I had a game genie with codes that these last people had and I had like 40 Sega Genesis games\""]
["28:24,000","28:28,660","\"I had every single Sonic game and like four pages worth of codes for every single game\""]
["28:28,660","28:34,760","\"And that's how I played love that's why I played Sonic because I had a fucking I had a gold mine\""]
["28:34,760","28:38,020","\"Unless playing ability so I don't know it anymore\""]
["28:38,020","28:40,220","\"But I used to know the level select code by heart\""]
["28:40,220","28:45,300","\"So if I wanted to just skip a stage I could just click a button and go back to the main menu and go to like a stage\""]
["28:45,300","28:49,260","\"I wanted to play that's sick and I also knew how to do debug mode by heart\""]
["28:49,260","28:52,100","\"Which I think is the traitor of this of Sonics\""]
["28:52,100","28:57,860","\"I don't know if it's the creator of Sonics birthday or the guy who made this games birthday. I should know my mom gave my\""]
