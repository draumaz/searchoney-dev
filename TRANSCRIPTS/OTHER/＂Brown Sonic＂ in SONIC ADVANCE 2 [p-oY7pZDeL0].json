["06:20,680","06:28,200","\"Kind of wanted to die if you would be so kind of slow. Yeah, this level is good is Sonic in the digital realm\""]
["06:28,200","06:30,520","\"Yeah, it's a virus now\""]
["06:30,520","06:39,160","\"We're almost done. There's only two levels left. You don't mean that. I'm serious. I'm serious. Okay\""]
["06:39,160","06:47,320","\"I don't think it's serious. I don't think he's serious. I don't think you're too seriously approaching attempt to play every single son of game\""]
["06:47,320","06:50,120","\"Advanced two will be knocked off the list\""]
["06:50,120","06:54,360","\"Completing is a different story, but playing is is is one\""]
["06:54,360","07:00,200","\"We might not beat every one of them, but the advanced games you probably could well. Where's your try?\""]
["07:00,200","07:05,160","\"I'm confident with advanced games. I'm not so confident with certain 3d ones\""]
["07:06,200","07:09,880","\"That's not foreshadowing or anything. It's just foreshadowing.\""]
["07:09,880","07:12,600","\"Corey?\""]
["07:12,600","07:14,600","\"You're on it today.\""]
["07:14,600","07:17,800","\"No, I genuinely didn't think. Do you really think I have the brain capacity?\""]
["07:17,800","07:19,160","\"Just take the credit buddy.\""]
["07:19,160","07:21,400","\"I'm not taking the credit for something I didn't think of.\""]
["07:21,400","07:25,320","\"Do you think people would be hyped if they announced Shadow of the Hedgehog 2?\""]
["07:25,320","07:26,040","\"Yes.\""]
["07:26,040","07:27,480","\"Yeah, absolutely.\""]
["07:27,480","07:31,880","\"I think there would be a weird contingent of people that insist that that one didn't get a fair shake.\""]
["07:31,880","07:34,520","\"Yeah, they'd be like, \"\"That came just didn't get its fair shot.\"\"\""]
["07:34,520","07:40,800","\"Yeah, you know, it's so fun to fight to kill enemies and I have to teleport to previous checkpoints to find more enemies\""]
["07:40,800","07:44,920","\"I think giving a gun was a good call\""]
["07:44,920","07:46,220","\"It was good\""]
["07:46,220","07:51,860","\"Do that more I feel like it would have just been fun if I could run around like this and just blow the brains off people as I'm running\""]
["07:51,860","07:55,600","\"I think you should have like a bag of acid that I can just toss on unsuspecting\""]
["07:55,600","08:01,680","\"I think you should have I think you should have a trench coat. I'm so sorry. I missed the ball bomb vest\""]
["08:03,480","08:05,480","\"Do you think\""]
["08:05,480","08:11,600","\"Sega would get in trouble if they put out an R rated shadow game? I mean, I don't I don't think so\""]
["08:11,600","08:15,480","\"I don't think so that'll be cool if you could play shadow and just like curb stomp people\""]
["08:15,480","08:20,600","\"Just like a GTA mod like but it's like American history X, but your shadow\""]
["08:20,600","08:25,880","\"I mean that would be cool, but I don't think they could do that. I don't think they don't want to write their name on that\""]
["08:25,880","08:29,040","\"What did you dodge into it? I don't know how\""]
["08:29,760","08:34,500","\"You know how you know I don't know how to do the launch thingy. Oh, okay. That one's confusing\""]
["08:34,500","08:36,940","\"I think they could do like Deadpool with shadow\""]
["08:36,940","08:42,640","\"They could give shadow a sword and a gun breaking the fourth wall all the time\""]
["08:42,640","08:48,860","\"Huh, I just don't care to say anything to the person on the other side. I don't need to impress you\""]
["08:48,860","08:51,760","\"What if Sonic the Hedgehog was yellow?\""]
["08:51,760","08:59,360","\"He is bad idea no no, I mean when he's not amoralized and then he turns blue when he gets the emeralds\""]
["08:59,360","09:04,480","\"Yeah, that would be more make more sense. I think so. What if something the hedgehog was red?\""]
["09:04,480","09:06,760","\"What is something the hedgehog was?\""]
["09:06,760","09:09,680","\"Green turquoise. Where's supersonic - how come he has a\""]
["09:09,680","09:15,080","\"Brown oh he's that'd be cool. That's a good idea. Yeah\""]
["09:15,080","09:20,800","\"Doom in on brown sonic from the fucking fleet lake comics. Yes. I read your comments comments\""]
["09:20,800","09:22,860","\"We did it again like we did in the past but now\""]
["09:28,360","09:32,520","\"Blue screen out every shade of blue separately and make it the shard darker shades of brown\""]
["09:32,520","09:34,920","\"Yes for the rest of the video\""]
["09:34,920","09:37,480","\"You just caught all of us telling you to do that and just\""]
["09:37,480","09:39,480","\"I don't care if the background's brown too\""]
["09:39,480","09:41,480","\"Make everything brown out of there\""]
["09:41,480","09:43,480","\"No Corey why did you do this?\""]
["09:43,480","09:45,480","\"I fucking know I'd fall to my dad\""]
["09:45,480","09:47,480","\"Look it's the brown techno zone\""]
["09:47,480","09:53,880","\"Look I love this little like normal head chug just because it's brown doesn't mean you can't call it the same thing Chris\""]
["09:53,880","09:58,240","\"What do you mean? It just it's just the techno zone all right the brown\""]
["09:58,240","10:02,640","\"the brown zone I feel like the brown zone has poo connotations\""]
["10:02,640","10:05,720","\"brown sound doesn't always have poo connotations\""]
["10:05,720","10:08,040","\"I feel like the music roach should have been called the brown\""]
["10:08,040","10:13,440","\"there's a there's like a famous like guitar amp tone called the brown sound\""]
["10:13,440","10:18,840","\"I don't I mean come on man I can't fucking react fast enough they're\""]
["10:18,840","10:22,000","\"asking so much like I'm gonna launch you across and you land and you can't\""]
["10:22,000","10:25,400","\"fall off I'm gonna give you exactly fucking one inch of movement space\""]
["10:25,400","10:32,800","\"Well now you got it. I just believe yeah, okay. Well I am still on the first fucking stage. Yeah, but I believe\""]
["10:32,800","10:38,520","\"I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Corey the headshot\""]
["10:38,520","10:43,540","\"Corey the you said that like Jimmy neutron. I can't talk like that\""]
["10:43,540","10:47,960","\"No, it's soon. I guess I'm gonna go on a different path now\""]
["10:47,960","10:53,920","\"Sonic just went totally stiff and flipped over that skill. Yeah\""]
["10:54,600","11:00,360","\"I'm glad I wasn't the only person that was that disappeared the fuck is even happening. I hate this background\""]
["11:00,360","11:05,680","\"Before the editor made it brown. I hated this background. Oh\""]
["11:05,680","11:12,400","\"Clarify that that I don't hate it because it's brown. Oh, well, you don't have to be such a coward epilepsy warning fine\""]
["11:12,400","11:14,400","\"I hate it a little more now that it's brown\""]
["11:14,400","11:17,880","\"It's too brown for the naked eye\""]
["11:17,880","11:23,440","\"Do you think that Sonic has like a regular butthole or do you think he has like the little like thing like a cat?\""]
["11:23,440","11:27,820","\"We said he has a little penny-sized butthole that we did talk about his penny size butthole\""]
["11:27,820","11:31,240","\"But we were debating more the size of that and if it's bigger small\""]
["11:31,240","11:35,440","\"He doesn't need one he doesn't always need\""]
["11:35,440","11:38,120","\"He's saying he's like Kim Jong-un where he doesn't poop\""]
["11:38,120","11:42,960","\"Basically because when he fuse with the chaos emeralds he doesn't need that need for food anymore\""]
["11:42,960","11:45,560","\"So the perfect chaos am Iling crashed into a bystanding\""]
["11:45,560","11:50,980","\"So where does it go and eat the chili burns it so fast. That's why he can move so fast\""]
["11:51,520","11:53,280","\"He doesn't need a shit anymore.\""]
["11:53,280","11:54,800","\"Yeah, he has light speed metabolism.\""]

["12:06,760","12:08,320","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["12:08,320","12:10,120","\"Because maybe.\""]

["12:13,280","12:16,240","\"they changed when he said that, because he never said that.\""]
["12:16,240","12:19,440","\"They literally faked in a line to make the trailer more awesome.\""]
["12:19,440","12:21,360","\"Which, you know, credit where credit's due.\""]
["12:21,360","12:24,360","\"It was epic, but be honest with your\""]
["12:24,360","12:29,080","\"Compardres yeah, they totally rode out the butthole side plot not that\""]
["12:29,080","12:36,180","\"You know, it's crazy. We watched the Mario trailer as of today's recording. We're gonna date the video with sannis\""]
["12:36,180","12:44,640","\"The Mario trailer came out today in this video, but uh, no, it's crazy how much the whole movie being CG makes it so much more likeable\""]
["12:44,640","12:50,060","\"I think the sonic movie really fucked itself by being alive. Nobody wanted it to be live action\""]
["12:50,060","12:57,100","\"I mean they say I still think they managed to like succeed in some regard. I like all the sonic parts\""]
["12:57,100","12:58,760","\"I honestly think the ring Chris\""]
["12:58,760","13:02,820","\"You know why you like it and this is what I stand by I wasn't able to say this before\""]
["13:02,820","13:07,360","\"But I do believe that there were two opposing forces to the sonic movie. This isn't a crock pot theory\""]
["13:07,360","13:10,100","\"I believe this to be true. Yeah, Tim Miller\""]
["13:10,100","13:16,860","\"Sucks fucking rear at writing. He's horrible. This is he done. He's done the fucking\""]
["13:17,780","13:20,000","\"First and furious you all the family crap\""]
["13:20,000","13:24,780","\"So think of all the parts in the sonic movie where he's like I love my mom and dad and then the fucking\""]
["13:24,780","13:30,620","\"Bianca wedding all that crap remember that shit. Yeah, that was Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler\""]
["13:30,620","13:35,120","\"Probably did all the sonic stuff if we're being honest. I don't think Tim Miller\""]
["13:35,120","13:41,700","\"No, Sonic as much as he knows how fucking families work. I guess so I'm pretty sure Tim Miller's fucking ass\""]
["13:41,700","13:44,500","\"He made the tournament that one fucking oh\""]
["13:44,580","13:50,760","\"You know what he made a movie about family and going fast. I think that that's not the worst\""]
["13:50,760","13:55,400","\"Think of it, but I see one paper why they went with it\""]
["13:55,400","13:59,900","\"But do you see do you understand why their human parts were probably written by Tim Miller and\""]
["13:59,900","14:04,460","\"Who directed scenes in Shadow the Hedgehog if you don't believe me you can look it up\""]
["14:04,460","14:08,960","\"He did direct stuff in the shadow the hedgehog. Yeah, the headshot opening. Yeah, he did that\""]
["14:08,960","14:14,540","\"Yeah, I am 100% convinced that the only reason I even liked the sonic movies is because of Jeff\""]
["14:14,540","14:20,440","\"Fowler all this fucking cool sonic scenes were Jeff Fowler and all the dumb shit was Tim Miller\""]
["14:20,440","14:23,200","\"Trying to fucking in sell himself to the public\""]
["14:23,200","14:29,420","\"Don't worry. He publicly did and then he fucking like went back on it. What I'm gonna die there\""]
["14:29,420","14:34,340","\"No, that's what I was supposed to do what about that? I'm gonna die there. I mean, I don't think these levels are late\""]
["14:34,340","14:40,740","\"Ever I think the instant kill death that's just sucked dick. No that you never put in this is just like a general consensus\""]
["14:40,940","14:44,420","\"Like it makes sense like a game like crash baneku where you can see that they're gonna kill you\""]
["14:44,420","14:49,340","\"Yeah, it makes no sense in Sonic Sonic actually genuinely doesn't have a lot of like insta kill death pits\""]
["14:49,340","14:53,860","\"There's a few stages like flying battery zone and like that one stage in Sonic 2 where you're\""]
["14:53,860","14:59,920","\"It's like, you know fucking we're flying on a plane and they do usually just drop you on the spikes or something, huh?\""]
["14:59,920","15:06,080","\"Oh, what the fuck does it happen? I did the dash thing again by accident why did you turn around though?\""]
["15:06,580","15:09,200","\"Cuz I'm like you okay when I play platforming games\""]
["15:09,200","15:14,680","\"I try to like preemptively plan where I'm gonna land and by doing that I move back and forth on the controller\""]
["15:14,680","15:19,920","\"But for some reason they decided to make pressing back and forth and jump do that move\""]
["15:19,920","15:23,160","\"Yeah, and I don't know why that was a horrible decision\""]
["15:23,160","15:29,260","\"Like and that that's supposed to knock you up there, but it never works. It's yeah, it's awful\""]
["15:29,260","15:34,760","\"Yeah, anyways, I still think this game is better than fucking advanced one. I still think it is. I don't care\""]
["15:34,760","15:38,700","\"I know it's annoying, but I would rather if we weren't on like you know like\""]
["15:38,700","15:44,200","\"We weren't trying to waste their fucking time. I would probably still be fine doing the stage over again\""]
["15:44,200","15:47,480","\"But I don't want to do the stage over again. Don't worry. We'll be okay now. Yeah\""]
["15:47,480","15:54,360","\"Yeah, he did it again. He went stiff and he flipped\""]
["15:54,360","15:57,280","\"You don't like that, huh? No, I like it\""]
["15:59,640","16:05,960","\"Shit I do think Sonic more often should go stiff or ragdoll like a skate three character. It is funny\""]
["16:05,960","16:09,080","\"Whoa, I didn't touch anything. So afraid something would happen\""]
["16:09,080","16:14,640","\"Cory you're doing great, and I think me and Lyle respects you so much because of this game\""]
["16:14,640","16:19,460","\"Yeah, because of this game guys you guys like you know I really want to see how you place on a good\""]
["16:19,460","16:21,300","\"Vance before I think you're cooler\""]
["16:21,300","16:28,400","\"This is before we decide if someone's allowed in the club we make them play sonic advanced - I'm fine with that\""]
["16:28,400","16:34,000","\"I wish I was like I mean again like I'm making dumb mistakes when I'm paying attention, but I\""]
["16:34,000","16:40,000","\"Was moving too fast. Oh, geez fucking god. That was nice that you didn't die\""]
["16:40,000","16:42,640","\"Yeah, it was very nice that they put a fucking ground there\""]
["16:42,640","16:50,040","\"Oh my god, don't why you putting those platforms that move fast? Why would I ever want that ever?\""]
["16:50,040","16:54,720","\"Don't do that\""]
["16:54,880","17:01,040","\"Moving quick no, he's on part two. There we go fucking hell Corey. That was\""]
["17:01,040","17:03,880","\"Desperating I know\""]
["17:03,880","17:09,680","\"This boss sucks you said that about every boss you always say that\""]
["17:09,680","17:13,040","\"Where you're running suck?\""]
["17:13,040","17:18,480","\"This one does suck. I remember this one's all about timing and these things spin and shoot bullets at you\""]
["17:18,480","17:20,160","\"I don't have spikes up here\""]
["17:20,160","17:22,160","\"Wait, it's about what you'll see\""]
["17:22,160","17:26,540","\"See that see a little laser things that come out this one is the worst boss\""]
["17:26,540","17:28,800","\"But you did so good\""]
["17:28,800","17:32,200","\"It shoots lasers. I can't see because the fucking thing is yellow\""]
["17:32,200","17:36,140","\"So I can't see the yellow bullets when they shoot. I think you just get over that\""]
["17:36,140","17:42,800","\"I mean you're just being a pussy see that background is hell. That is all really annoying really\""]
["17:42,800","17:45,000","\"It's too much too busy\""]
["17:45,000","17:47,280","\"You know what they say last too busy\""]
["17:47,880","17:55,980","\"I'm always on that hustle. I hope Sonic's still brown. Dear editor. This is a letter from the past. Does Sonic still brown?\""]
["17:55,980","17:57,980","\"I hope he is. I\""]
["17:57,980","18:01,100","\"Hope you're doing well. Okay, save right after this. Your friend\""]
["18:01,100","18:04,260","\"Sonic\""]
["18:04,260","18:08,180","\"I was writing about himself a third person being brown\""]
["18:08,180","18:12,800","\"But he's blue so he's in his own fucking warp reality\""]
["18:12,800","18:15,960","\"Whoa, look what you did you silly little monkey\""]
["18:17,760","18:24,140","\"Missed it. What's got an extra you guys ever do a time capsule as a kid. Yeah, we did actually in school\""]
["18:24,140","18:29,740","\"Those are never coming back up are they I don't they're definitely forgotten about where do you see time capsules?\""]
["18:29,740","18:31,740","\"You take a break in the school\""]
["18:31,740","18:38,780","\"You dig up the ancient crypt in the school and you bury your time capsule in it. No, I know what it is, but like\""]
["18:38,780","18:41,580","\"We did take up an old lady\""]
["18:41,580","18:47,380","\"She knows the location. Yeah, I don't understand why you would make\""]
["18:47,380","18:54,640","\"Like spikes appear that's you're already dodging too much stuff to begin with you're making me do this crap\""]
["18:54,640","19:03,120","\"I mean, I think it's just a fun a challenge, you know, Corey's the biggest baby. I know and don't you forget it\""]
["19:03,120","19:10,140","\"If there was a baby and it was six feet tall would it be stronger or weaker than a normal guy I\""]
["19:10,140","19:13,140","\"Don't like this\""]
["19:13,860","19:19,660","\"It's faces mush, but they're like I can't fight back. They're like girthy though for their size\""]
["19:19,660","19:20,700","\"Oh\""]
["19:20,700","19:26,580","\"So you mean if you scale the baby up? Yeah? Yeah, if you scaled a baby up to six feet would it be stronger or weaker than a normal guy?\""]
["19:26,580","19:31,620","\"It'd probably be stronger. No, no, no, it no it would not so it would be frail\""]
["19:31,620","19:36,740","\"No, but if you scaled up and like a buff dude, he surely gets stronger by being scaled up\""]
["19:36,740","19:38,860","\"Yeah, he also has to be scaled up six feet\""]
["19:38,980","19:43,780","\"But what would it like it's what it dry out the density so he's technically not getting any stronger?\""]
["19:43,780","19:49,780","\"I don't know. I'm not talking about the science of scaling it up. I'm saying like the baby. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know\""]
["19:49,780","19:55,080","\"It's called honey. I blew up the baby and I've seen it when I was a shit\""]
["19:55,080","19:57,860","\"I would love that movie, but then if you watch this adult it sucks\""]
["19:57,860","19:58,580","\"It's horrible\""]
["19:58,580","20:03,660","\"It's really bad and like I was expecting the effects to be like really good the effects of him\""]
["20:03,660","20:07,860","\"Why did you put this bike away for literally one millisock?\""]
["20:07,860","20:09,060","\"You take it all?\""]
["20:09,060","20:10,700","\"Not really, but I\""]
["20:10,700","20:15,520","\"But the baby's running around the house and it's clearly just like a grown man and a baby\""]
["20:15,520","20:21,980","\"So bad, I like yeah like I I still remember that looking so good, but it looks terrible\""]
["20:21,980","20:24,800","\"It looks so bad. I do remember that\""]
["20:24,800","20:31,340","\"I'm thinking about it the kid is like this like he has this like orange ginger hair that you can't miss it\""]
["20:31,340","20:36,700","\"And he has these like fucking like oh fuck he has these like Stewie overalls that are like\""]
["20:36,700","20:43,060","\"Unmissable as well. Yeah, so when you see this tiny man running around. It's creepy. Yeah, you know what?\""]
["20:43,060","20:48,560","\"I I remember this recently because I was watching I was watching the Kenobi show\""]
["20:48,560","20:54,300","\"Kenobi yeah, yeah, the fucking Obi Kenobi show. Yeah, and that show was so boring\""]
["20:54,300","21:00,160","\"Yeah, that show that like half of that show the cast is actress for like baby Leia, which is\""]
["21:00,660","21:03,980","\"Not shouldn't be a thing, but thank you Chris for being on it\""]
["21:03,980","21:10,340","\"Like half of it is it's a kid that's like so young that when she runs\""]
["21:10,340","21:16,280","\"She's still like off balance and stuff. Yeah, and it reminded me of like the opening of baby geniuses\""]
["21:16,280","21:22,220","\"When they have like the baby escaping from the facility and they just have it like fucking like running around\""]
["21:22,220","21:28,940","\"Yeah, I remember that that looks so bad. Oh, I did it. Oh, I did it. Oh God fuck that boss\""]
["21:28,940","21:33,660","\"Fuck everything about everything that could be about that boss. You know what was the only good thing about honey\""]
["21:33,660","21:38,540","\"I blew up the kid when he got fucking exploded into a million pieces when the military came and blues face up\""]
["21:38,540","21:43,120","\"Yeah, no actually was this song that played the ice cream band song. I still remember it was like\""]
["21:43,120","21:52,380","\"You were that I just remember like they sung a song to the baby excuse me\""]
["21:52,380","21:57,260","\"I mean a burp I remember the facility looking really fucking cool. I think they nuked the baby in the end, right?\""]
["21:57,820","22:01,980","\"Well, like sure they realized that it wasn't going to stop growing and they make the tearful decision\""]
["22:01,980","22:09,840","\"No spoilers. They make the mom big to quell the baby. Really? Yeah, and then and then later on like she do like really big\""]
["22:09,840","22:15,060","\"Breast no no what I was gonna say is like they hint that like oh\""]
["22:15,060","22:22,140","\"He's like maybe we can go on a date like this sometime and she like kind of like you know really clearly like some macro micro\""]
