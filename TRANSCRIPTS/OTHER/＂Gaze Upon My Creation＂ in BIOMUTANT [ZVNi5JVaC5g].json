["06:13,260","06:16,140","\"I hate these fucking animals, dude\""]
["06:16,140","06:21,960","\"This game is all about like preserving animals in the environment, but it's making a horrible case\""]
["06:21,960","06:26,240","\"Yeah, it makes me want to fucking splash toxic sludge on that thing\""]
["06:26,240","06:31,420","\"Yeah, you're telling me if we save the animals are gonna start evolving and saying muma and spillie dorath\""]
["06:31,420","06:33,100","\"Yeah\""]

["06:54,420","07:03,040","\"Here's here's my unpopular video game opinion. I love these go on. Yeah, I think crafting systems\""]
["07:03,040","07:07,800","\"just fucking weakened design because then the developers don't know exactly like what\""]
["07:07,800","07:09,600","\"stats you're packing.\""]
["07:09,600","07:10,920","\"I just don't want to find them fun.\""]
["07:10,920","07:12,560","\"I don't find them fun either.\""]
["07:12,560","07:16,960","\"I see like why they're like intuitively appealing like oh I can put whatever I want.\""]
["07:16,960","07:21,880","\"Number one like nine times out of ten like you just slap every possible attachment on\""]
["07:21,880","07:24,720","\"the gun and you're good to go.\""]
["07:24,720","07:29,440","\"But also like I don't know I sort of like when there's like a strength to design because\""]
["07:29,440","07:31,160","\"'cause what you sacrifice when you put in\""]
["07:31,160","07:34,360","\"a crafting system like this is like you can't put\""]
["07:34,360","07:37,320","\"like a special thing anywhere.\""]
["07:37,320","07:39,280","\"Like a good example is like Fallout 3,\""]
["07:39,280","07:42,360","\"like Lincoln's repeater and Fallout 3.\""]
["07:42,360","07:45,160","\"Like I still remember where you fucking find that thing\""]
["07:45,160","07:48,880","\"because it's like, oh yeah, it's in the fucking museum.\""]
["07:48,880","07:51,000","\"And when you get it, it's like, holy shit,\""]
["07:51,000","07:53,120","\"this is like the special item.\""]
["07:53,120","07:56,320","\"But I don't know where I got any of my fucking like,\""]
["07:56,320","08:02,740","\"Guns with four scopes and eight bump stocks on them and fall out for yeah, or in any Borderlands game\""]
["08:02,740","08:09,820","\"Yeah, exactly. I want to make something for mooma. I want to paste my eyes on another creature\""]
["08:09,820","08:15,140","\"Unpresented to mooma bleeding another thing about crafting is I just don't want to learn all the recipes\""]
["08:15,140","08:19,720","\"I just don't care. Yeah, that's the other thing is it. It's just more time in a menu also\""]
["08:19,720","08:25,640","\"She's definitely clipping. I knew it clipping what you tried to gaslight me look at her fucking flank on her left\""]
["08:25,640","08:29,840","\"like her left hip or I guess her right your left look at that look at that\""]
["08:29,840","08:45,240","\"clipping right under her belt well you are I oh you can't say that you are gonna\""]
["08:45,240","08:47,240","\"to bleed that out and make it look like I said.\""]
["08:47,240","08:48,620","\"- It kinda sounds so much better.\""]
["08:48,620","08:50,240","\"- You're an asshole.\""]
["08:50,240","08:52,160","\"- No, her.\""]

["09:34,440","09:41,920","\"Really am not investing this dialogue. Well, it'll fuck this feels like I'm back in time\""]
["09:41,920","09:44,640","\"I don't know why oh it feels like a plain fable\""]

["10:08,840","10:14,260","\"He says you're right. Nobody can tell him what he can and can't do and that includes you\""]

["10:29,440","10:35,960","\"Maybe we judge this game too early. I you know what mm-hmm. I will say about this game\""]
["10:36,320","10:41,600","\"Hmm. I feel like once we're out of the tutorial eight years from now it might get fun\""]
["10:41,600","10:47,440","\"I could like it definitely has mechanics that it's really really trying to show you\""]
["10:47,440","10:50,920","\"Maybe once it leaves you the fuck alone. It'll be better\""]
["10:50,920","10:55,880","\"You know what I don't get how come when people make games like this and everyone unanimously is like\""]
["10:55,880","11:01,880","\"You know the if the first hour is so fucking boring. It sucks. Oh you got a struggle against him\""]

["11:08,960","11:15,580","\"Was it not working when you're mashing it? Yeah, it didn't go up at all. That was like a lightsaber battle. Did they steal your weapon?\""]
["11:15,580","11:25,360","\"The most important does not just sound like a Sam like doing the dishes it does yeah\""]
["11:25,360","11:29,320","\"Why do that you know?\""]
["11:30,280","11:33,360","\"Because like then you then you gotta like correct him like oh no\""]
["11:33,360","11:42,120","\"It doesn't sound quite right. Can you do like more of a gaga gaga bossing sing is this your slow poo-pah or whatever?\""]

["12:25,080","12:34,500","\"Whoa, dude you got some fucking sick moves for a weed child. You're having a fucking ball dude. Yeah, Tomer's having so much fun.\""]
["12:34,500","12:39,640","\"Well, I'm trying to enjoy the game while I can before I get dragged into another 15 cut scenes.\""]
["12:39,640","12:41,640","\"You know why this reminds me of Fable?\""]
["12:41,640","12:47,800","\"Oh, why? It just always has music going off. That's true. You know what? It does kind of like\""]
["12:48,760","12:52,880","\"Evoke fable sort of in the way that you're like walking around and like digging you know like\""]
["12:52,880","12:56,840","\"Fable like those like patches of dirt that you dig and fucking I\""]
["12:56,840","12:59,280","\"Don't know I\""]
["12:59,280","13:02,840","\"Think this game would benefit from just not having music all the fucking time\""]
["13:02,840","13:09,560","\"You know breath of the wild was really minimalist with how it used music and I think that that was\""]
["13:09,560","13:15,880","\"Ultimately a good call. Yeah, I heard that I heard other people were annoyed with it because it's like not as bomb by\""]
["13:15,880","13:17,880","\"Stake is the other games\""]
["13:18,080","13:20,080","\"Yeah, it's definitely like\""]
["13:20,080","13:23,120","\"It's definitely like got a lot of restraint\""]
["13:23,120","13:27,340","\"For a game like it is but I heard they didn't do enough of the\""]
["13:27,340","13:31,480","\"Minimalist music so it got really repetitive hearing the same little piano bit\""]
["13:31,480","13:38,520","\"So I never got tired of it that that was a very like relaxing game like at the end of a the end of a long day\""]
["13:38,520","13:44,240","\"When Zack's done with his fucking stupid TV show we should definitely play that again\""]
["13:44,240","13:47,020","\"I'd be down to breath of the whizzy\""]

["14:12,540","14:16,660","\"and you're back in like a young shit tutorial they probably originally put this at the beginning\""]
["14:16,660","14:21,340","\"in the game and everyone told them it was boring and tedious so instead of doing anything\""]
["14:21,340","14:25,340","\"about that they just pushed it slightly further back into the game.\""]
["14:25,340","14:27,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["14:27,340","14:30,420","\"This game definitely does seem like it has two tutorials.\""]
