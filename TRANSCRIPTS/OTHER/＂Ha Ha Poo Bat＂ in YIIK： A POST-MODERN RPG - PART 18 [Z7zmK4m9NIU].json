["00:00,000","00:06,000","\"Would you be surprised if there was a Pokemon called Poobat because of Wano?\""]
["00:06,000","00:08,000","\"Because Nintendo would not want to do that now.\""]
["00:08,000","00:10,000","\"They didn't even have a fish gun.\""]
["00:10,000","00:12,000","\"There's Poop Digimon.\""]
["00:12,000","00:17,000","\"Well, that's the thing is Digimon has always been fine to do stuff like that.\""]

["00:18,000","00:20,000","\"Pokemon's always tried to be a lot more tame.\""]
["00:20,000","00:24,000","\"You feel like Cloister was intentionally designed to evoke a vagina.\""]
["00:24,000","00:28,000","\"Yeah, because they all got horny while they're making it.\""]
["00:28,000","00:30,800","\"Know I did so why is that okay, but not poop\""]
["00:30,800","00:38,800","\"Because you can say that's artistic and also it's a reproductive organ which is a part of nature\""]
["00:38,800","00:41,520","\"They got muck. He's part of nature\""]
["00:41,520","00:47,460","\"Yeah, but poop is like the ha ha funny side rather than seeing a cloister and going ah, yes\""]
["00:47,460","00:50,680","\"I say I say sex is the funny ha ha part of nature\""]
["00:50,680","00:57,600","\"If you said the word sex to Miyamoto, I guarantee he would not laugh he would clasp his hands over his mouth like a cloister\""]
["00:57,600","01:00,600","\"Yeah, he's using withdraw\""]

["01:38,860","01:42,260","\"It's just gonna run right back into it. Did you really think people wanted this in an RPG?\""]
["01:42,260","01:44,260","\"I want a room full of trampolines\""]
["01:44,260","01:47,260","\"That would be more fun\""]
["01:51,680","01:57,180","\"Oh, because he's poo so he says poo now you're getting it. I think I'm getting it. It's actually an acronym\""]

["06:01,240","06:07,220","\"No more Rory. Yeah Rory's honestly kind of useless\""]
["06:07,220","06:09,880","\"Because what's the point of him taking damage?\""]
["06:09,880","06:12,440","\"What's the point?\""]
["06:12,440","06:14,440","\"You can also use items\""]
["06:14,440","06:22,440","\"So can anyone he can say people are people people are people what other stuff like what what it was other?\""]
["06:22,440","06:29,160","\"I don't remember all of them. I know he has one where he can talk to the enemy and I think with encounters\""]
["06:29,160","06:31,660","\"It can at least do things but with bosses it does nothing\""]
["06:31,660","06:36,520","\"And he can cry yeah, I really\""]
["06:36,520","06:39,600","\"Which of those is more preferable\""]
["06:39,600","06:43,920","\"You can bitch. Hey, that's a new one. What the hell a stop sign\""]
["06:43,920","06:47,520","\"Stop playing. Why do you think he's in a cave?\""]
["06:48,920","06:53,840","\"I don't know because I remember there's a post that you read later on about the stop signs coming to life\""]
["06:53,840","06:56,540","\"Oh, really? I don't remember fighting one of these guys here\""]
["06:56,540","07:00,120","\"She's kind of cute though. Got it say that\""]
["07:00,120","07:07,960","\"They'll see in a lot of RPGs random encounters. They last you know, maybe 30 seconds. Oh my god not here\""]
["07:07,960","07:13,440","\"Yeah, no these battles an event how the fuck did they allow this to happen?\""]
["07:13,440","07:17,680","\"I don't necessarily mind that idea of expanding. I don't mind if the battles are actually\""]
["07:17,680","07:23,580","\"Yeah, if they're interesting, but then you also can't have like goombas you can't know you have to have any variety\""]
["07:23,580","07:27,480","\"Yeah, you have to have actual combat it can't just be this it's true\""]
["07:27,480","07:31,480","\"There's also this is a mini game. I like was that it's not like a fun system\""]
["07:31,480","07:36,060","\"You hold a and you let go of it when it's over the little marker. Oh my bad\""]
["07:36,060","07:38,600","\"So I guess they just\""]
["07:38,600","07:41,960","\"Repositioned where that mini game is because that used to be as attack mini game\""]
["07:41,960","07:45,120","\"Okay\""]
["07:45,360","07:51,320","\"Let's use a skill you guys. That one does a lot of damage. I remember if you line it up. I think LPTOS LPTOS is really good\""]
["07:51,320","07:56,920","\"Yeah, yes, it does. That's really good. Panda is also a good idea. Yes, Panda is good and LPTOS is good\""]
["07:56,920","08:00,040","\"Alex at least has some skills that have use\""]
["08:00,040","08:03,240","\"Uh-huh\""]
["08:03,240","08:06,240","\"Check her skills. Oh, does she have yeah?\""]
["08:06,240","08:11,200","\"She has spread item already that means you can use any item and just use it on everybody at the same time\""]
["08:11,200","08:17,280","\"That's pretty cool. So she's really good to have that. I really don't know how to classify any of these party members\""]
["08:17,280","08:20,640","\"Michael is the guy of the group\""]
["08:20,640","08:23,760","\"Alex is the man of the group\""]
["08:23,760","08:28,080","\"Chandra is the confusing one of the group\""]
["08:28,080","08:34,200","\"I thought you were also gonna say she was like a dude or something like that. Damn it. Just interchangeable\""]
["08:34,200","08:37,520","\"Descriptors for all of them\""]
["08:37,520","08:41,240","\"Claudio hits things, but Alex also hits things.\""]
["08:41,240","08:45,040","\"But he hits things with a circular object.\""]
["08:45,040","08:47,720","\"Well, Claudio uses a pointy object.\""]
["08:47,720","08:52,520","\"Go, Chandra. Go, Chandra.\""]
["08:52,520","08:56,320","\"Uh huh. Uh huh.\""]
["08:56,320","08:59,240","\"Do you like that the blocks are scrolling faster than the ground is?\""]
["08:59,240","09:03,480","\"Yeah, what's that about? Oh, thanks, Chandra.\""]
["09:05,720","09:07,720","\"Funny ones okay\""]
["09:07,720","09:14,440","\"Her tiny tiny little hands. He's gonna get me. No, he isn't. Yes. I just son him again\""]
["09:14,440","09:24,400","\"Oh fuck you it's not like they have very good pathing dungeon key stun him\""]
["09:24,400","09:29,720","\"I hate you\""]
["09:29,720","09:32,640","\"Nothing like having to take some damage to get a key\""]
["09:33,680","09:37,840","\"Yeah, what the hell's going on even oh no, you're becoming Alex\""]
["09:37,840","09:40,120","\"What's happening?\""]
["09:40,120","09:45,280","\"Okay, look at these two something's happening in here. There's so many yeah, there's a lot of people here today\""]
["09:45,280","09:50,160","\"The terrified boy are you I go go go go\""]
["09:50,160","09:58,880","\"Alex says yes, excited girl all this ghost hunting has really relieved the spark in our revive the spark in our relationship\""]
["10:00,040","10:07,040","\"They really relieved the spark of a relationship. No passion anymore. I wish we could just run into the spikes and ragdoll. Oh\""]
["10:07,040","10:12,080","\"Hey, got bored. Oh, yeah the kitty kit. I\""]
["10:12,080","10:16,880","\"Hate you guys. You just run past him. Hey, whoa\""]
["10:16,880","10:22,360","\"Hit him again. There you go. He's kind of again. See get ready\""]
["10:22,360","10:25,600","\"And I think you escaped him\""]
["10:28,160","10:33,640","\"Oh god, no, no, no, no, no. I think it's only gonna get harder and harder to avoid these guys. Yeah, I use your hair\""]
["10:33,640","10:35,640","\"I think I think\""]
["10:35,640","10:41,340","\"Alexique the creator of this game. What is his actual name Alex? He\""]
["10:41,340","10:48,480","\"I'm getting the impression that he's intentionally like, you know setting up these enemies so that you have to fight them\""]
["10:48,480","10:51,280","\"most likely\""]
["10:51,280","10:54,320","\"It's still pretty easy to get around them though\""]
["10:54,320","10:59,760","\"I don't know in that case why not just make it random encounters. I mean the world map does that\""]
["10:59,760","11:04,560","\"I guess that's true. It's because he also wanted to mix in like a bit of earthbound here. You can see them\""]
["11:04,560","11:07,200","\"So you could get around them potentially\""]
["11:07,200","11:12,040","\"He's very impressed by this you're playing him a nice song fuck I\""]
["11:12,040","11:16,720","\"Bet it's poop poop and maybe a bat. Oh\""]
["11:16,720","11:22,760","\"Sorry, I got a little bit wrong two bats and a poop. I said two poops and a bat the bats have less HP\""]
["11:22,760","11:25,040","\"It seems like it's true. They do shit. Oh\""]
["11:25,040","11:29,600","\"Still think we're gonna die here\""]
["11:29,600","11:34,840","\"You have so many items. I think you'll be okay remember Chandra can use items that affect everybody\""]
["11:34,840","11:39,460","\"Yeah, she can she has a skill for it. Well, we do we can do cheeseburgers\""]
["11:39,460","11:42,480","\"Yeah\""]
["11:42,480","11:46,000","\"Cheeseburgers for every she's the best character so far. I\""]
["11:46,000","11:52,280","\"Mean both her and Claudia or party members that at least have something and okay, so it's Claudia's deal\""]
["11:52,280","11:57,960","\"He has some skills that can do good damage output and they can like target everybody\""]
["11:57,960","12:04,800","\"The thing is Alex and Claudia both have some similar functions. So it's kind of like yeah, okay a little bit repetitive\""]
["12:04,800","12:12,600","\"Claudio's mini games are different though. Oh, that was that's Michael's old attack mini game\""]
["12:12,600","12:15,280","\"And that one really stinks because there's nothing to it\""]
["12:17,640","12:24,200","\"That was the thing the the attack mini games. I guess they got oh this one's really long and slow what\""]
["12:24,200","12:29,140","\"Okay\""]
["12:29,140","12:37,460","\"So depending on how many times you hit him you do a different move really yes see it changed\""]
["12:37,460","12:44,600","\"Okay problem with that ability to\""]
["12:45,740","12:50,660","\"Different versions of this game are gonna have more latency. You're not gonna respond to that very quick\""]
["12:50,660","12:53,880","\"You'd say that about any game though. It's true\""]
["12:53,880","13:00,460","\"I always see people complaining about like oh don't bring up frames per second. Don't bring up latency that made me\""]
["13:00,460","13:02,220","\"Oh, it makes me mad\""]
["13:02,220","13:05,600","\"Do you think do you think at some point it would be considered a bonus?\""]
["13:05,600","13:12,220","\"Well, that they're good that it like a like in those those magazine reviews you always show me how it has the little\""]
["13:12,680","13:17,920","\"Rating scale at the bottom like that you're gonna have a game from a five out of ten for latency\""]
["13:17,920","13:22,880","\"I don't think it'll happen. It's got the most latency out of any game too specific of a concept\""]
["13:22,880","13:28,660","\"Yeah, why did these fights have to literally take 15 minutes like what is happening?\""]
["13:28,660","13:35,120","\"Because then you could put on the back of the box that this game is 40 minutes or sorry 40 minutes\""]
["13:35,120","13:37,200","\"if only\""]
["13:37,200","13:39,920","\"No, I'm sick of games trying to be long\""]
["13:41,000","13:47,160","\"This game should have been all of a minute and maybe four times the price maybe eleven minutes exactly oh\""]
["13:47,160","13:51,360","\"To go with the title because it's a nice I see yeah\""]
["13:51,360","13:56,440","\"It should have been a year 11 minutes and then a thousand more years it should have been a hundred and nineteen\""]
["13:56,440","13:59,160","\"Fuck this\""]
["13:59,160","14:08,540","\"I remember last time it didn't do it a lot of damage, but he was missing a lot\""]
["14:08,540","14:13,700","\"Yeah, so we'll see you can get them caught is the thing you can hit one and it keeps turning around left and right\""]
["14:13,700","14:17,140","\"Oh, you can move yeah like that. That's how you do it cool\""]
["14:17,140","14:24,760","\"Well stops it when you hit it. What was so if you keep doing that just keep it trapped you can just pile it up what?\""]
["14:24,760","14:27,740","\"I'm confused. I\""]
["14:27,740","14:29,860","\"Did okay. Yeah, I did alright\""]
["14:29,860","14:32,420","\"that skill hits everybody and\""]
["14:33,180","14:38,480","\"Every time you hit one of those guys it pauses them and it makes them turn the opposite direction\""]
["14:38,480","14:43,820","\"So you can just keep them caught forever. Hmm. I think if you stack up like 30 hits, it does a lot of damage\""]
["14:43,820","14:49,860","\"It used to be better. I think from what I remember. I remember it used to be like the only game breaking\""]
["14:49,860","14:52,580","\"We use you would just use it constantly and kill everything\""]
["14:52,580","14:56,400","\"And Panda was broken too because Panda didn't\""]
["14:59,900","15:04,220","\"It's not even the idea of like, oh he blocks magic damn, what magic?\""]
["15:04,220","15:10,540","\"Have you been seeing these enemies doing magic? They have one thing they can do. So all Panda does is just lock everything.\""]
["15:10,540","15:12,300","\"You're telling me I stopped this thing?\""]
["15:12,300","15:13,500","\"Is it the red one only?\""]
["15:13,500","15:14,460","\"Well, like, what is there?\""]
["15:14,460","15:16,780","\"There is no red one this time, so I don't know what the deal is.\""]
["15:16,780","15:20,700","\"These are things that he gets so easily fixed. Why not?\""]
["15:20,700","15:25,100","\"Or maybe if people weren't complaining about the alpaca, he could have actually even had a game.\""]
["15:25,100","15:27,260","\"Yeah, it's a very good point.\""]
["15:27,900","15:30,940","\"They complain about the funniest part of the whole fucking game.\""]
["15:30,940","15:32,060","\"[laughs]\""]
["15:32,060","15:35,740","\"I feel bad for me, clearly cares.\""]
["15:35,740","15:38,220","\"No, you can tell, like he wanted to make something.\""]
["15:38,220","15:40,460","\"It's just he's very clueless in a lot of areas.\""]
["15:40,460","15:40,860","\"Bro.\""]
["15:40,860","15:43,900","\"And then where other people could come in and give input,\""]
["15:43,900","15:45,580","\"nobody actually ended up doing it.\""]
["15:45,580","15:46,940","\"They just told him stop making games.\""]
["15:46,940","15:48,300","\"Oh, you were talking, yeah.\""]
["15:48,300","15:51,420","\"You go into that discussion, you were having it the other day\""]
["15:51,420","15:53,740","\"while we weren't recording about like a lot of the problems\""]
["15:53,740","15:56,700","\"this game has and his response to it specifically.\""]
["15:56,700","15:59,260","\"Oh, I mean everybody has that quote from him.\""]
["15:59,260","16:00,960","\"I think that was really foolish on his end.\""]
["16:00,960","16:03,360","\"Like I can't get behind him on anything that he said.\""]
["16:03,360","16:04,360","\"I think it's ridiculous.\""]
["16:04,360","16:06,560","\"I get where it's coming from.\""]
["16:06,560","16:09,880","\"Imagine the idea of that, that you spent years making a game like this.\""]
["16:09,880","16:11,440","\"It's full-scale, it's voice acted.\""]
["16:11,440","16:15,840","\"You really tried your best and it ended up being just a mess.\""]
["16:15,840","16:21,640","\"And then before it even came out, everyone just decided already that it was terrible\""]
["16:21,640","16:24,000","\"and you needed to stop making things.\""]
["16:24,000","16:25,200","\"Yeah, no, that's really mean.\""]
["16:25,200","16:27,200","\"So this game was just doomed on arrival.\""]
["16:27,200","16:28,520","\"It was dead on arrival.\""]
["16:28,520","16:31,280","\"And then any criticism he was getting,\""]
["16:31,280","16:32,400","\"it was usually stuff like that.\""]
["16:32,400","16:34,720","\"It was like the Alpaca scene.\""]
["16:34,720","16:37,040","\"People were mad about the Elisa Lamb thing, which I think--\""]
["16:37,040","16:38,320","\"- Yeah, that was the idea of like,\""]
["16:38,320","16:41,320","\"oh no, you just can't reference real world tragedies\""]
["16:41,320","16:42,800","\"in your game. - I think it's dumb\""]
["16:42,800","16:44,560","\"how he's working it into this plot.\""]
["16:44,560","16:45,920","\"I think it's very silly,\""]
["16:45,920","16:48,320","\"especially that he's tying it to a romance and everything.\""]
["16:48,320","16:50,520","\"You can tell it's like a weird thing with his own position,\""]
["16:50,520","16:52,560","\"but the idea of that,\""]
["16:52,560","16:54,080","\"that was what people were complaining about.\""]
["16:54,080","16:55,160","\"It wasn't how it's worked in.\""]
["16:55,160","16:57,840","\"It was just the idea of you can't use a case like that.\""]
["16:57,840","16:59,360","\"You can't use incidents like that.\""]
["16:59,360","17:00,640","\"People do it all the time.\""]
["17:00,640","17:02,600","\"You could, you could make it work.\""]
["17:02,600","17:03,680","\"It's not off limits.\""]
["17:03,680","17:06,400","\"It's just he didn't do anything like tasteful with it.\""]
["17:06,400","17:08,680","\"- You mean there's a missing girl and it's based on that?\""]
["17:08,680","17:09,520","\"- Yeah. - Yeah.\""]
["17:09,520","17:11,840","\"- There was an, I'm surprised you haven't heard about it.\""]
["17:11,840","17:14,120","\"There's a girl and it's specifically\""]
["17:14,120","17:18,120","\"the same situation like this where there's a video,\""]
["17:18,120","17:21,240","\"there's a video of her like seemingly struggling\""]
["17:21,240","17:24,880","\"against people invisibly pulling her out of an elevator.\""]
["17:24,880","17:29,400","\"Oh, and then they like found her body in a nearby water tower like later\""]
["17:29,400","17:35,720","\"So like people there was a lot of like theories about like oh what's going on? What could this video be?\""]
["17:35,720","17:39,800","\"Did they even call her the same name? No, no, that's it's like a\""]
["17:39,800","17:43,320","\"Lisa lamb. Yeah in game\""]
["17:43,320","17:49,920","\"It's weird in game because I think they say like oh, it's a nickname. They call her Sammy slash\""]
["17:49,920","17:53,880","\"Sammy pack yes that they keep switching her name around\""]
["17:54,480","17:59,200","\"What I imagine happened because I know he makes one comment about it being a nickname\""]
["17:59,200","18:04,500","\"The thing is too she makes a big deal about the cat's gender at the start, but then it changes later on anyways\""]
["18:04,500","18:09,880","\"Yeah, I think he just gave you some forget about the thing we said about the the\""]
["18:09,880","18:14,880","\"What was the contradictory thing that we said earlier that one kid says the economy is great\""]
["18:14,880","18:17,320","\"And then all of a sudden Michael's talking about how the economy sucks\""]
["18:17,320","18:23,920","\"Oh, fuck lots of little details like that. It's very strange. Oh my god\""]
["18:23,920","18:24,760","\"- God.\""]
["18:24,760","18:27,360","\"But you need to wake up.\""]
["18:27,360","18:29,760","\"- Fuckin' wake up.\""]
["18:29,760","18:31,200","\"- You know what, no, I'll use Alex\""]
["18:31,200","18:33,280","\"and then I'll wake her up with someone better\""]
["18:33,280","18:34,120","\"or shittier.\""]
["18:34,120","18:37,880","\"- I would absolutely say that gamers in specific are like--\""]
["18:37,880","18:39,520","\"- They can't handle any--\""]
["18:39,520","18:41,760","\"- Every medium has like people who want it\""]
["18:41,760","18:43,160","\"to be safe and boring.\""]
["18:43,160","18:44,560","\"- You also, it's--\""]
["18:44,560","18:46,920","\"- But it seems like those problems here.\""]
["18:46,920","18:48,640","\"- People hated this when it first came out,\""]
["18:48,640","18:51,920","\"so it was just natural to like dig up more and more and more.\""]
["18:51,920","18:57,320","\"And most of the complaints about this game, I think we're at the part right now where you're completely justified to complain.\""]
["18:57,320","18:59,680","\"This part is a slog. It's miserable.\""]
["18:59,680","19:00,420","\"Definitely.\""]
["19:00,420","19:05,720","\"But people didn't get this far. A lot of the complaints about this game were all from the first half.\""]
["19:05,720","19:09,220","\"Yeah, like the first hour or two is where a lot of the complaints were.\""]
["19:09,220","19:10,720","\"People didn't even see the later stuff.\""]
["19:10,720","19:16,120","\"Because as long as you have your video up so that you can get some views because you talked about the popular punching bag this week.\""]
["19:16,120","19:16,520","\"Yeah.\""]
["19:16,520","19:21,160","\"- And when I saw that, that Elpaca thing, the video online,\""]
["19:21,160","19:23,720","\"I would have thought that was like end-game stuff.\""]
["19:23,720","19:25,460","\"- No, it's very early on.\""]
["19:25,460","19:28,640","\"And that's the clip that most people are familiar with,\""]
["19:28,640","19:29,520","\"the clip.\""]
["19:29,520","19:30,880","\"They're not familiar with the whole game.\""]
["19:30,880","19:32,320","\"They're not familiar with why it pops up,\""]
["19:32,320","19:33,520","\"which is why I think a lot of people\""]
["19:33,520","19:35,960","\"miss what the context of that moment is.\""]
["19:35,960","19:39,320","\"You can definitely say that, yeah, the tonal shift\""]
["19:39,320","19:40,400","\"doesn't work.\""]
["19:40,400","19:41,760","\"I can understand that,\""]
["19:41,760","19:44,360","\"but it is clearly what he wanted there.\""]
["19:44,360","19:46,080","\"That is what the developer intended.\""]
["19:46,080","19:47,880","\"It's just really goofy.\""]
["19:47,880","19:49,600","\"It's entertaining at least.\""]
["19:49,600","19:51,560","\"And that's the thing is having an update\""]
["19:51,560","19:53,240","\"that sucks out some of the entertainment\""]
["19:53,240","19:56,000","\"just because people said stop being entertaining.\""]
["19:56,000","19:57,720","\"I can't get behind that.\""]
["19:57,720","19:58,560","\"- Yeah, I know.\""]
["19:58,560","19:59,480","\"It makes me sad.\""]
["19:59,480","20:02,280","\"- Part of the problem that I've been noticing\""]
["20:02,280","20:05,120","\"is like every time Chris comes up with a new prompt,\""]
["20:05,120","20:06,760","\"he has no fucking idea what to do.\""]
["20:06,760","20:09,600","\"And it's because it's not explaining itself clearly.\""]
["20:09,600","20:10,600","\"- It's not telegrapically there.\""]
["20:10,600","20:12,960","\"- No, this game doesn't convey like anything.\""]
["20:12,960","20:15,400","\"It's probably why there's just a hint option in the menu.\""]
["20:15,400","20:17,400","\"Which one of these is good? Okay, beat down.\""]
["20:17,400","20:19,400","\"Yeah, this one's showing up.\""]
["20:19,400","20:21,400","\"You do. You let go on the green.\""]
["20:21,400","20:22,400","\"Okay, that's right.\""]
["20:22,400","20:23,400","\"Pretty close.\""]
["20:23,400","20:26,400","\"But that used to be his attack mini game.\""]
["20:26,400","20:28,400","\"Okay, well that's doing good.\""]
["20:28,400","20:31,400","\"Look, this thing's gonna kill me either way. It's like not fair.\""]
["20:31,400","20:35,400","\"But if you can get good at that one, I remember it does a ton of damage.\""]
["20:35,400","20:37,400","\"Like, cool.\""]
["20:37,400","20:39,400","\"What am I supposed to do here?\""]
["20:39,400","20:41,400","\"This seems like this is supposed to be a mini boss encounter,\""]
["20:41,400","20:43,400","\"even though the music is a song you've already heard,\""]
["20:43,400","20:47,880","\"already heard so it doesn't really make it feel like a mini boss. Yeah, use an item on everyone.\""]
["20:47,880","20:51,640","\"You could do smelling salts. It's in skills, right? Yeah, it's in skills.\""]
["20:51,640","20:57,320","\"Um, if you did smelling salts with the share item, you get both Alex. Yeah, you get two people\""]
["20:57,320","21:01,320","\"revived off of it. Maybe I should wait for Claudia to die. What if she dies next?\""]
["21:01,320","21:08,120","\"Want to be wasting four smelling salts? No, you'd be wasting one. Yeah. That's why she's so good.\""]
["21:08,120","21:10,240","\"One item gets to go to four people.\""]
["21:10,240","21:11,240","\"That's crazy.\""]
["21:11,240","21:12,240","\"Okay.\""]
["21:12,240","21:14,720","\"Okay, she breaks the game in so many ways.\""]
["21:14,720","21:15,720","\"Oh, it didn't work.\""]
["21:15,720","21:17,200","\"Yeah, it didn't work on Alex.\""]
["21:17,200","21:18,560","\"Did you use the right thing?\""]
["21:18,560","21:20,120","\"Yeah, was that the right ability?\""]
["21:20,120","21:21,040","\"Am I stupid?\""]
["21:21,040","21:22,680","\"I didn't look so...\""]
["21:22,680","21:24,200","\"I didn't look if you're stupid.\""]
["21:24,200","21:25,840","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["21:25,840","21:26,840","\"It's a possibility.\""]
["21:26,840","21:28,680","\"[Laughter]\""]
["21:28,680","21:29,880","\"That's kind of me.\""]
