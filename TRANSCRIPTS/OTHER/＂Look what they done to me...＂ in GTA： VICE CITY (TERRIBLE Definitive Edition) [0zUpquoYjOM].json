["03:31,000","03:33,080","\"Oh, well when I was talking about the rain\""]
["03:33,080","03:38,760","\"I mean in this remaster when they put out the remaster my point is like why did they just use the original rain effect though?\""]
["03:38,760","03:46,600","\"But because the way new engines work new engines have different shaders I see is this is all in unreal now, right?\""]
["03:46,600","03:50,700","\"Yeah, which I don't think unreal for even existed yet\""]
["03:50,700","03:55,280","\"Again real engine existed, but I'm real for definitely didn't\""]

["04:20,300","04:27,700","\"Should feel a lot nicer than that. Yeah, like I swear like I would have noticed if it was that bad in the original\""]
["04:27,700","04:32,900","\"But that's possible. I mean, what was that? I either even played our standards were lower than two\""]
["04:32,900","04:42,260","\"What was that about shitting your pants?\""]
["04:44,660","04:47,120","\"Hey, you shit your pants. I'm here for you\""]

["05:32,420","05:40,020","\"I definitely remember that making it sound effect in the original. Yeah, I feel like I feel like just they just constantly drop the ball\""]
["05:40,020","05:42,260","\"And that's why this thing has like a fucking two\""]
["05:42,260","05:46,620","\"I would be surprised to see it under his stuff. I saw was insane where they rounded out the\""]

["05:51,520","05:55,380","\"Yeah, like freaking lug nut or the bolt or whatever\""]
["05:55,380","06:01,340","\"Like there's a store with a giant bolt outside, but they put us like a subdivide modifier on top of it\""]
["06:01,340","06:06,520","\"They just smooth it out. Yeah, just turn it into a circle. It's like it's supposed to be a bolt\""]
["06:06,520","06:11,180","\"That's the entire fucking point. Yeah, there's a ton of weird shit. They did\""]
["06:11,180","06:18,420","\"at least GTA online is cool. Do you actually play GTA online? I suck like 20 grand this\""]
["06:18,420","06:25,660","\"what to do it. Okay micro transactions. I love my shark cards. You what? You pay for\""]

["06:54,060","06:57,980","\"i'm going to give up the car of the giant other cars or less there's this little hammer\""]
["06:57,980","07:01,980","\"I can't believe this is happening.\""]
["07:01,980","07:04,980","\"Remember, remember he's innocent.\""]
["07:04,980","07:11,980","\"That played out kind of awkwardly.\""]
["07:11,980","07:12,980","\"What do you think of that?\""]
["07:12,980","07:14,980","\"I want to go in there.\""]
["07:14,980","07:16,980","\"I want to go in this office building.\""]
["07:16,980","07:17,980","\"You look so real.\""]
["07:17,980","07:20,980","\"Imagine how much more fun the game would be if you could go in that room.\""]
["07:20,980","07:24,980","\"Wasn't that something we talked about when we were playing San Andreas, like the reflections?\""]
["07:24,980","07:27,100","\"Like one of them was completely fucked.\""]
["07:27,100","07:28,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:28,100","07:30,660","\"I love listening to this to you.\""]
["07:30,660","07:32,500","\"So this thing fall apart.\""]
["07:32,500","07:37,380","\"It's a little fat on the back.\""]
["07:37,380","07:38,900","\"Isn't that cool?\""]
["07:38,900","07:40,660","\"I would love one of these.\""]
["07:40,660","07:42,100","\"With a big external engine.\""]
["07:42,100","07:44,420","\"I almost hit that poor woman.\""]
["07:44,420","07:49,340","\"Do you remember in the original when you'd get into a car, then you'd like see like\""]
["07:49,340","07:52,020","\"hundreds of the same car as soon as you get into it?\""]
["07:52,020","07:53,020","\"You'd also see.\""]
["07:53,020","07:55,020","\"It was like memory efficient, right?\""]
["07:55,020","07:57,940","\"To never have too many of the same types of cars on screen.\""]
["07:57,940","07:58,940","\"Oh, God.\""]
["07:58,940","08:00,580","\"Or go to many different types of cars.\""]
["08:00,580","08:01,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:01,580","08:02,780","\"I'm pretty sure.\""]
["08:02,780","08:03,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:03,780","08:07,500","\"Because I think it's a lot cheaper for it to reuse the same model.\""]
["08:07,500","08:11,500","\"I've, isn't there also a thing like at least a by experience, a GTA, these early games\""]
["08:11,500","08:15,740","\"where you see like four of the same character walking behind each other in the street.\""]
["08:15,740","08:16,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:16,740","08:18,380","\"I've definitely seen that before.\""]
["08:18,380","08:19,380","\"I never thought about that.\""]
["08:19,380","08:20,380","\"So it makes a lot of sense.\""]
["08:20,380","08:24,940","\"I mean I could be completely wrong, but that would be my first guess. Oh my god\""]
["08:24,940","08:30,540","\"Spiked her she's stuck in the concrete now. You caused that Chris. This guy's like my wife\""]

["08:52,260","09:00,780","\"Looks so sure. There's no way the game used to do that. Is there?\""]
["09:00,780","09:07,020","\"It's possible. I mean, the game that we did some some some weird, some nutty stuff.\""]
["09:07,020","09:10,100","\"I really do want to try the PS2 version.\""]
["09:10,100","09:11,340","\"Come back here.\""]

["09:58,820","10:02,780","\"Just go to show the killing people and stealing their money is efficient\""]

["10:06,180","10:09,500","\"Hey\""]
["10:09,500","10:12,260","\"Oh, it's possible because he's part of the story that he does it a\""]

["10:16,860","10:24,860","\"Oh boy, this fucking door fell off.\""]
