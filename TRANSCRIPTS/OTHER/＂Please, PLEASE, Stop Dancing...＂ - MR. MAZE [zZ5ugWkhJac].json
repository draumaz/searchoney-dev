["13:30,120","13:38,120","\"Others decide to stand still and not do anything in the mazes.\""]
["13:38,120","13:39,620","\"That's pretty good choice.\""]
["13:39,620","13:41,120","\"They don't get very far.\""]

["15:00,980","15:05,420","\"I suppose left to right like a book. That's a good maze tactic\""]
["15:05,420","15:10,780","\"I have visited many great places\""]
["15:10,780","15:16,920","\"Paris Rome New York Iraq and Swindon town who the fuck is Swindon?\""]

["15:20,880","15:27,820","\"Spaghetti nothing quite compares to the majesty in awe of the sunset route. It is kind of cool rocks the real\""]
["15:27,820","15:32,160","\"Architectural wonder castle. Wow. I've heard about this castle\""]
["15:32,160","15:37,620","\"Sure, I'd like to visit the castle but for most it's a dangerous one-way trip\""]
["15:37,620","15:44,400","\"The high dweller of this realm of magical authority sends some supplies out into the wild cheese this makes looks really hard\""]
["15:45,600","15:48,680","\"Lately we've been forced to live off the land. It's a green fire\""]
["15:48,680","15:53,280","\"I'm the outdoors type but a lot of dwellers aren't and left for the castle because of it\""]
["15:53,280","15:57,160","\"Hmm I see thanks for the tip, bro\""]
["15:57,160","16:04,240","\"We gotta get some toothpaste for this fucking teeth ski. Yeah, professor tooth ski. No, that tooth skis\""]

["16:16,960","16:22,680","\"Hello, it's gonna confuse me over here. You think you can take on the maze yes\""]
["16:22,680","16:25,900","\"Kick that tree remember there was a tree\""]
["16:25,900","16:32,560","\"We should take little rabid pellet shits like Hansel and Gretel and direct our way back\""]
["16:32,560","16:36,640","\"Exactly. Here's just gonna eat them all up though. You'll be left\""]
["16:38,320","16:40,660","\"Go the other way where I don't see these\""]
["16:40,660","16:46,780","\"I guess I have to play make believe here. It's kind of ruined my immersion honestly\""]
