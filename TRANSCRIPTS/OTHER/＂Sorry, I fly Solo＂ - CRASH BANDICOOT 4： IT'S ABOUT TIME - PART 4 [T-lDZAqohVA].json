["15:28,580","15:32,080","\"I kinda hate how the masks are worn on your back as a full bodysuit.\""]

["15:33,280","15:34,880","\"I wish he just wore them on his face.\""]

["15:54,480","15:57,680","\"You can have the masks be expressive, and then they're a little character.\""]
["15:57,680","16:04,180","\"I-I guess the-the logic behind it would be that it's on his back so it reads that he has it, but I don't-\""]
["16:04,180","16:09,180","\"I don't think that that really would matter. If he wore it, like, on the top of his head, like a helmet or something.\""]

["16:09,680","16:11,680","\"Maybe that would be a better solution than that.\""]
