["00:12,560","00:13,960","\"Yeah. The sex bot.\""]
["00:13,960","00:17,400","\"Alice could not stop talking about how much you wanted to fuck this plastic robot.\""]
["00:17,400","00:17,900","\"*Laughs*\""]
["00:17,900","00:21,060","\"Did you find out the question, Alex?\""]
["00:21,060","00:23,560","\"Oh, that the guy on the phone had.\""]
["00:23,560","00:24,200","\"Who'd that?\""]
["00:24,200","00:25,340","\"No?\""]
["00:25,340","00:26,000","\"No?\""]
["00:26,000","00:28,780","\"You're such a disappointment.\""]
["00:28,780","00:30,780","\"Come on, we know that.\""]
["00:30,780","00:34,780","\"Boy, can you do any damn thing right?\""]
["00:34,780","00:36,780","\"Okay buddy.\""]
["00:36,780","00:38,780","\"That was your line read, huh?\""]
["00:38,780","00:40,780","\"He's gonna shoot you with a laser.\""]
["00:40,780","00:44,780","\"Sorry, I won't be too mean here but uh...\""]
["00:44,780","00:46,780","\"Listen, when uh...\""]
["00:46,780","00:48,780","\"Alex was tiny that was real scary to him.\""]
["00:48,780","00:50,780","\"It sounds like Mick joking around.\""]
["00:50,780","00:52,780","\"I hate you!\""]
["00:52,780","00:54,780","\"We're loyal.\""]
["00:54,780","00:56,780","\"It does!\""]
["00:56,780","01:00,940","\"Whoa, does it sound like a serious line read love?\""]
["01:00,940","01:05,240","\"Yeah, Lyle, can you record your own version of these and compare it?\""]
["01:05,240","01:19,300","\"He'd not have put like reverb or something on it\""]
["01:19,300","01:23,580","\"Calm down\""]
["01:24,460","01:27,300","\"We get it just get on with it\""]
["01:27,300","01:30,740","\"Okay\""]
["01:30,740","01:44,140","\"Okay, anyways my face is screwed up\""]
["01:44,140","01:49,080","\"This music reminds me of the room before the chow gardens when you're running around as I\""]
["01:51,460","01:57,580","\"Like this version of the song like I don't really like how long the mind dungeon takes, but I like the music\""]
["01:57,580","02:00,960","\"You always say stupid shit like that\""]
["02:00,960","02:03,960","\"Say good things\""]
["02:03,960","02:10,900","\"Invest in music if your game is anything where people are gonna be sitting for an extended period doing something tedious\""]
["02:10,900","02:15,600","\"At least give them good music. What's the one that you always play for me the um what oh?\""]
["02:15,600","02:16,680","\"Is it?\""]
["02:16,680","02:18,680","\"Pictionary is that the one I'm thinking oh?\""]
["02:18,680","02:20,520","\"Pictionary has really good music cuz that's a\""]
["02:20,520","02:24,620","\"It's Tim Follin. He does really good stuff. What else did he do?\""]
["02:24,620","02:31,160","\"Silver Surfer on NES. Whoa, it has really good music. Yeah, I like that treasure master, which is really good\""]
["02:31,160","02:38,760","\"He usually is unfortunately attached to like really poor quality games, but always really good music. He's talented\""]
["02:38,760","02:43,880","\"Yeah, you didn't that was the thing with that song if you play that to anybody. They're not gonna\""]
["02:43,880","02:44,720","\"They're not gonna guess.\""]
["02:44,720","02:46,960","\"Oh, it's a it's a dictionary for the fucking S NES\""]
["02:46,960","02:47,800","\"whatever it was.\""]
["02:47,800","02:48,640","\"'Cause it sounds really good.\""]
["02:48,640","02:50,200","\"It has nothing to do with it.\""]
["02:50,200","02:51,400","\"It was on the SNES.\""]
["02:51,400","02:52,740","\"Well, it was on the NES.\""]
["02:52,740","02:54,280","\"Picture is even worse.\""]
["02:54,280","02:56,000","\"(laughing)\""]
["02:56,000","02:57,000","\"How do you do picture?\""]
["02:57,000","02:57,840","\"I don't know.\""]
["02:57,840","02:59,240","\"I feel like it draws pictures\""]
["02:59,240","03:01,640","\"and you're just supposed to guess as players what they are\""]
["03:01,640","03:02,680","\"or has mini games.\""]
["03:02,680","03:03,880","\"I don't remember how it works.\""]
["03:03,880","03:05,000","\"Gotcha.\""]
["03:05,000","03:07,800","\"But yeah, he did music for us really good.\""]
["03:07,800","03:08,680","\"Where is he now?\""]
["03:08,680","03:11,280","\"I don't know where he is now.\""]
["03:11,280","03:12,120","\"In the ground.\""]
["03:12,120","03:13,040","\"You cannot level up.\""]
["03:13,040","03:13,860","\"Nope.\""]
["03:13,860","03:16,060","\"I hope we don't have to fight lots of monsters in this dungeon.\""]
["03:16,060","03:17,660","\"I'd be really unfortunate.\""]
["03:17,660","03:20,460","\"Maybe all the extra grinding you did will be enough.\""]
["03:20,460","03:22,360","\"I hope.\""]
["03:22,360","03:24,060","\"God, I hope.\""]
["03:24,060","03:26,860","\"I was terrified.\""]
["03:26,860","03:28,860","\"This is the part of the game that we've been dreading.\""]
["03:28,860","03:33,060","\"I was looking up a guide for how to get through this dungeon and it looks really tedious.\""]
["03:33,060","03:36,660","\"I think by looking up a guide, you're just spoiling the fun.\""]
["03:36,660","03:42,060","\"So people do want to sit and get stuck in the ink for just days and days on end.\""]
["03:42,060","03:44,460","\"It is the ideal choice of a game for that.\""]
["03:44,460","03:46,980","\"This should not be a kind of game you get stuck in.\""]
["03:46,980","03:49,940","\"No, this is the kind of game that should at least play well,\""]
["03:49,940","03:52,020","\"so that we can be entertained the whole way through.\""]
["03:52,020","03:54,060","\"The etching on the glass--\""]
["03:54,060","03:55,860","\"Makes the framerate drop.\""]
["03:55,860","03:56,700","\"Yeah, apparently.\""]
["03:56,700","03:58,740","\"I think it's the film grain there.\""]
["03:58,740","03:59,740","\"What the hell?\""]
["03:59,740","04:01,740","\"[LAUGHS]\""]
["04:01,740","04:02,740","\"Hmm.\""]
["04:02,740","04:03,980","\"Hey, you.\""]
["04:03,980","04:04,820","\"Speak to me.\""]
["04:04,820","04:05,540","\"Tell me what to do.\""]
["04:05,540","04:07,100","\"Sorry, but I can't talk now.\""]
["04:07,100","04:08,020","\"I have much--\""]
["04:08,020","04:10,460","\"That's their original identity that they were telling us\""]
["04:10,460","04:10,960","\"about.\""]
["04:10,960","04:18,200","\"give me this what how did you there was a glimmer oh I'm getting out of here\""]
["04:18,200","04:25,760","\"use a dungeon key yes give me out is this robot satanic I'm sure we leave that\""]
["04:25,760","04:31,160","\"was actually pretty tough puzzle oh no no I'm out the faded you know what let's\""]
["04:31,160","04:36,960","\"see let's see yeah let's test our abilities good music but we've been\""]
["04:36,960","04:40,880","\"saying that all games yeah every time a new song comes on I feel like I was\""]
["04:40,880","04:44,240","\"We've heard this one before. I think there's only like two bad ones we've heard so far\""]
["04:44,240","04:49,580","\"I think I've been warming up to some of these songs even more. I feel like this is loading faster than then it did\""]
["04:49,580","04:53,740","\"Yeah, it didn't take that one. Maybe we're getting like you're used to it\""]
["04:53,740","04:58,740","\"We're used to the pain fucking time dilates when you play this game. All right\""]
["04:58,740","05:02,000","\"Whoops. Nope. E P\""]
["05:02,000","05:07,240","\"I dropped it. Oh, yeah\""]
["05:07,240","05:09,960","\"You do okay\""]
["05:09,960","05:11,160","\"That's a pretty bad one.\""]
["05:11,160","05:13,960","\"Oh, whoa! Holy quackamole!\""]
["05:13,960","05:15,960","\"Okay, we might be strong enough.\""]
["05:15,960","05:16,960","\"That's a good sign.\""]
["05:16,960","05:17,960","\"That's a very good sign.\""]
["05:17,960","05:22,960","\"The joke that we were making earlier is this dungeon is full of fights, so maybe we'll be okay.\""]
["05:22,960","05:23,960","\"I really hope so.\""]
["05:23,960","05:26,960","\"No, that one, great. Oh my god.\""]
["05:26,960","05:28,960","\"I didn't even have to put Panda down.\""]
["05:28,960","05:29,960","\"Uh...\""]
["05:29,960","05:31,960","\"Your dopamine is skyrocketing.\""]
["05:31,960","05:32,960","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["05:32,960","05:33,960","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["05:33,960","05:34,960","\"This game's pretty dope.\""]
["05:34,960","05:36,960","\"My means are going off the charts.\""]
["05:36,960","05:38,960","\"Where's a mean?\""]
["05:38,960","05:39,680","\"That dope.\""]
["05:39,680","05:40,480","\"We'll find her.\""]
["05:40,480","05:41,840","\"Where's that dope?\""]
["05:41,840","05:42,840","\"I mean, oh, okay.\""]
["05:42,840","05:45,040","\"There's a chest in here.\""]
["05:45,040","05:45,680","\"It be.\""]
["05:45,680","05:46,440","\"I'm sorry.\""]
["05:46,440","05:47,240","\"I mean, I didn't mean it.\""]
["05:47,240","05:49,160","\"It's just that your name suited the word.\""]
["05:49,160","05:51,720","\"We got cheeseburgers again.\""]
["05:51,720","05:53,440","\"Oh, go over there and fuck that face.\""]
["05:53,440","05:54,640","\"Oh boy.\""]
["05:54,640","05:56,280","\"It's very convenient that it's in the wall.\""]
["05:56,280","05:57,480","\"Oh, as dick height.\""]
["05:57,480","05:57,960","\"Go fuck it.\""]
["05:57,960","05:58,640","\"That's all I do.\""]
["05:58,640","06:02,400","\"Please, please you fuck that thing too.\""]
["06:02,400","06:05,080","\"I don't know.\""]
["06:05,080","06:06,240","\"Fuck the black blob.\""]
["06:06,240","06:07,160","\"There.\""]
["06:07,160","06:08,240","\"That's more my speed.\""]
["06:08,680","06:10,680","\"Do you think Alex would though?\""]
["06:10,680","06:17,220","\"Yes, I could never tell I don't think I don't know where his standards are he has no standards\""]
["06:17,220","06:22,560","\"He would think of himself as too good for it, but if the thing came up to him he would he would like not resist\""]
["06:22,560","06:30,060","\"You got 10 nope. Oh and that was enough. Okay. I guess we're not gonna get to see what the enemies do\""]
["06:30,060","06:32,060","\"I'm fine with that\""]
["06:33,560","06:39,160","\"What happened you know what they're gonna do they're gonna do one attack because most of these enemies only have one attack\""]
["06:39,160","06:41,160","\"I'd be curious to see what it is\""]
["06:41,160","06:47,400","\"You saw it on panda talk to the lady. Well lady. Oh this face what she say I\""]
["06:47,400","06:52,280","\"Bet you're wondering why I'm crying aren't you not really\""]
["06:52,280","06:56,880","\"You see it's because I don't have any appendages. Yeah, you do you have stairs?\""]
["06:56,880","07:03,120","\"I've often been asked why stationary objects such as a wall would need mobility enabling extremities\""]
["07:03,120","07:08,120","\"I long to travel the world touch objects and interface with those that I love.\""]
["07:08,120","07:11,120","\"How can I do that if I am simply a crying wall?\""]
["07:11,120","07:14,120","\"You could try being a talkative wall instead of a crying wall.\""]
["07:14,120","07:15,120","\"Or a happy wall.\""]
["07:15,120","07:18,120","\"Now please let me sit here in my sorrow.\""]
["07:18,120","07:19,120","\"Happily.\""]
["07:19,120","07:21,120","\"Not like you can help me in any way.\""]
["07:21,120","07:23,120","\"Well now I really don't want to.\""]
["07:23,120","07:24,120","\"What will you do?\""]
["07:24,120","07:26,120","\"Give me nothing.\""]
["07:26,120","07:28,120","\"That's the perfect response.\""]
["07:28,120","07:30,120","\"I was hoping it would go...\""]
["07:30,120","07:32,120","\"*screams*\""]
["07:32,120","07:35,680","\"No, shuts were given this day. You give it shit\""]
["07:35,680","07:41,480","\"Unfortunately, these load times are going to be with the battles. They're gonna fill time with it. Yep\""]
["07:41,480","07:45,820","\"We still have to wait for these this game makes me cry, but hey, this is a new battle song\""]
["07:45,820","07:50,880","\"They stole this from Rugrats on game work color. Who's this little mega? Did you have that as a kid?\""]
["07:50,880","07:56,840","\"I think I had Rugrats time travel. Yeah, I did too. It was really bad. It was terrible\""]
["07:56,840","08:01,660","\"I really hated it. Do you think even just one is still gonna be enough to kill them? I guess we'll see\""]
["08:01,660","08:08,720","\"You only need to what is what happened to the difficulty?\""]
["08:08,720","08:15,360","\"The boss fight we did earlier still took some time. What's weird is the enemies out on the overworld?\""]
["08:15,360","08:20,220","\"We're still giving you more trouble. Yeah, what the those were a monster dungeons to be fair off screen\""]
["08:20,220","08:24,760","\"I was grinding a bit, but maybe I did a little more than a bit. Maybe it was a little too much\""]
["08:25,000","08:30,340","\"It's a fun effect isn't it that masking yeah, I like it and it's not making the frame rate drop unlike earlier\""]
["08:30,340","08:34,540","\"Oh, no, somebody died. They walked all the way over here then died\""]
["08:34,540","08:37,740","\"Oh, no\""]
["08:37,740","08:39,140","\"Okay, me\""]
["08:39,140","08:42,100","\"Do you think they're gonna be tough? I want to see a spooky jost I\""]
["08:42,100","08:46,140","\"Like the little scary sound of me. I appreciate we have new enemies for once\""]
["08:46,140","08:51,660","\"Yeah, me too and some new music although this one we've heard we have heard this one not a very ghostly - no\""]
["08:51,660","08:54,640","\"I would have been happy if that's not a ghost\""]
["08:54,640","08:57,880","\"I've been lied to.\""]
["08:57,880","09:00,800","\"That's a Millennium Bug.\""]
["09:00,800","09:01,800","\"Oh, haha!\""]
["09:01,800","09:02,800","\"Cause Yeegh!\""]
["09:02,800","09:03,800","\"You get it?\""]
["09:03,800","09:04,800","\"Because Yeegh!\""]
["09:04,800","09:08,240","\"In the year 2000 anything is real.\""]
["09:08,240","09:09,240","\"Anything could be Yeegh.\""]
["09:09,240","09:10,240","\"You could be Yeegh.\""]
["09:10,240","09:11,240","\"I could be Yeegh.\""]
["09:11,240","09:12,240","\"In the year 2000.\""]
["09:12,240","09:16,080","\"There are other Yeeghs I should know about.\""]
["09:16,080","09:17,440","\"Did I do what I need to do here?\""]
["09:17,440","09:19,240","\"I got the two fires.\""]
["09:19,240","09:21,040","\"Keep looking I guess.\""]
["09:21,040","09:22,040","\"This doesn't seem to do anything.\""]
["09:22,040","09:23,600","\"So as it's holding a single man.\""]
["09:23,600","09:25,600","\"I think that you gotta come back here later.\""]
["09:25,600","09:27,600","\"What are you going to do boy?\""]
["09:27,600","09:28,600","\"Oh.\""]
["09:28,600","09:29,600","\"What do you think the batteries do?\""]
["09:29,600","09:32,600","\"He said he could play his Game Boy at the beginning of the game if he had batteries for you.\""]
["09:32,600","09:33,600","\"Oh my!\""]
["09:33,600","09:34,600","\"Clearly that's what this is for!\""]
["09:34,600","09:35,600","\"I guess.\""]
["09:35,600","09:36,600","\"I guess the other batteries too.\""]
["09:36,600","09:38,600","\"These are really fucking expensive batteries.\""]
["09:38,600","09:40,600","\"Do you really need four of each?\""]
["09:40,600","09:43,600","\"I assume that's like the health items for the robot.\""]
["09:43,600","09:44,600","\"Yes.\""]
["09:44,600","09:45,600","\"As you can see.\""]
["09:45,600","09:46,600","\"Ahh.\""]
["09:46,600","09:47,600","\"Admittedly.\""]
["09:47,600","09:49,600","\"I don't really want these either.\""]
["09:49,600","09:50,600","\"Why not?\""]
["09:50,600","09:52,600","\"I want to play the Game Boy.\""]
