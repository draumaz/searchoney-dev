["18:29,220","18:35,000","\"Yeah, it's just really like dry, but it's not a bad thing look we get the water in this reminds me of\""]
["18:35,000","18:38,660","\"I've been trying to figure out what the fuck this music reminds me of\""]
["18:38,660","18:44,020","\"But there's this game called fucking like something or other on the Obra Dan. Yes. Yeah\""]
["18:44,020","18:45,300","\"I was just like yeah\""]
["18:45,300","18:50,020","\"Yeah, that game is really good return to the Obra Dan or yeah return of Obra Dan or something\""]
["18:50,020","18:54,780","\"That's a good game play a viewer. We're probably not gonna play it on here. It's too\""]
["18:55,140","19:00,340","\"It's - you have to think way too hard and we can't do that. It's true. You really do look at that\""]
["19:00,340","19:05,100","\"That's a game. You shouldn't do on a let's play. Honestly. It's like you should get invested in it and enjoy it\""]
["19:05,100","19:10,620","\"Yeah, not it actually rocks. Oh my god. Where does this need to go in this mouth feed it?\""]
["19:10,620","19:19,120","\"He's thirsty each feed him he does have like a big open like mouth. I think or either that or you're just supposed to connect it to the other\""]
["19:19,120","19:21,120","\"- that's also\""]
["19:21,120","19:25,560","\"Oh, they're - I think is the fueling - oh no, it's not connected to him. Yeah, you can\""]
["19:25,560","19:30,680","\"I go in his back see that little like yeah, you think it's that little this this thing no\""]
["19:30,680","19:35,280","\"The other thing that thing this thing other tube you connect those two tubes together\""]
["19:35,280","19:39,720","\"I think this is the fuel tube. I really think that's a separate thing once you get the fuel\""]
["19:39,720","19:41,720","\"Don't you want the two tubes to be connected\""]
["19:41,720","19:44,560","\"No rings the two two\""]
["19:47,080","19:49,400","\"There's a lot of lore in that about tubes\""]
["19:49,400","19:54,720","\"Like if you read the similar little early in there's a lot of tube lore\""]
["19:54,720","19:57,780","\"Yeah, they talk about how Frodo had his tubes tied\""]
["19:57,780","20:05,660","\"He says it was his burden all hobbits have tubes and I had mine tied\""]
["20:05,660","20:10,880","\"Oh no, it's still attached to the bottom\""]
["20:10,880","20:16,200","\"Let me try this one more time now that that's disconnected and to bomb a deal\""]
["20:16,200","20:24,460","\"Yeah, I remember my friend fucking told me about Tom Bonbodil, and I was like you're lying\""]
["20:24,460","20:30,200","\"That's it sounds really really weird. It's not a character like that. You can kind of see why they left it out of the movie. Yeah\""]
["20:30,200","20:32,080","\"Absolutely\""]
["20:32,080","20:37,640","\"Wait, I think I had it there for a sec. You did and then you lost it. It actually oh\""]
["20:37,640","20:44,480","\"Yeah, it does something you got to just connect it. It's weird that it wouldn't stick that is so bizarre\""]
["20:44,480","20:51,820","\"Because of that fucking strand on the other side of it that's tugging at it. Oh, yeah, it's pulling it out damn it\""]
["20:51,820","20:58,240","\"Break gotta go the other side there you go. Maybe you can shoot it in there from that\""]
["20:58,240","21:04,620","\"Oh, you think that's the idea is that I just laser it over maybe for some reason I doubt that but you could try\""]
["21:04,620","21:07,920","\"Well kind of work\""]
["21:07,920","21:13,040","\"It's a slow. Oh no, it's working it works. It did something. Holy shit\""]
["21:13,720","21:17,900","\"Don't fail me now because I'm having a good time\""]
["21:17,900","21:31,140","\"The physics of this are infuriating it looks really jank. Oh, oh my god fuck\""]
["21:31,140","21:37,360","\"Yeah, all right, please get the other one in before I fuck it's screwed. I mean that one isn't even\""]
["21:37,360","21:40,520","\"Attached anything doesn't hurt to have it ready\""]
["21:41,420","21:47,620","\"All right might as well while you're here the loose body physics. What are you?\""]

["21:55,660","22:00,740","\"Now now I must never come here again or touch any of those\""]
["22:00,740","22:03,580","\"the fuel room\""]
["22:03,580","22:05,580","\"Prime for fuel. Oh\""]

["22:16,080","22:20,580","\"What I think I might have to build a bit of a bridge. Oh, yeah, you probably do. Oh, that's it\""]
["22:20,580","22:23,880","\"That's like a tube. You could probably just push past there we go\""]
["22:23,880","22:27,020","\"Well done. Those are the psyche out. I guess\""]
