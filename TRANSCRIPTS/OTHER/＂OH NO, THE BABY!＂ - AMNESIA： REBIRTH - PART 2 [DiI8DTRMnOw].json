["02:42,800","02:48,800","\"is supposed to be like a psychological thing. I know what they're doing. Obviously, it's not working.\""]
["02:48,800","02:51,360","\"Like I think you're not really in the desert right now is my point.\""]

["02:54,800","02:55,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:55,600","02:58,000","\"You're supposed to play this game alone as a woman.\""]

["06:01,700","06:05,860","\"The one thing I really do love about this game is how interactive everything feels\""]
["06:05,860","06:10,540","\"You know the environment and stuff is cool, and it just feels good to open shit and\""]
["06:10,540","06:16,300","\"It's lovely this though. I couldn't tell you what this is looks like a pipe\""]

["07:07,620","07:15,100","\"Can't believe it dude the wall's so shiny someone lubed it up before we got here\""]
["07:15,100","07:21,860","\"It's made of Jerusalem stone. That's a really good like tactic for keeping people out just lubing up the big tall walls\""]
["07:21,860","07:24,300","\"Yeah, and then when the sun's out it just shines in their eyes\""]
["07:25,180","07:29,400","\"Can you just open that big gate like can you just like literally open that ah?\""]
["07:29,400","07:33,040","\"Okay quite the puzzle you just solved\""]
