["10:52,640","10:55,560","\"Do you like Nestle as a company?\""]
["10:55,560","11:01,920","\"The alternative is artificial sugar which is still bad for you corn syrup and all this other shit\""]
["11:01,920","11:07,020","\"They don't tell you about that literally is probably the reason why everyone's so fucking depressed and fucked up all the time\""]
