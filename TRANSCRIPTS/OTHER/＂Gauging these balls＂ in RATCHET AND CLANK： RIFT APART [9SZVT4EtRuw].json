["00:16,720","00:19,440","\"-One million dollars to do that to your ball sack?\""]
["00:19,440","00:24,000","\"-Ugh, no. -Oh, I actually wouldn't.\""]
["00:24,000","00:26,080","\"-A million? -Really?\""]
["00:26,080","00:29,520","\"-I basically...would you cut your ball sack off for a million dollars?\""]
["00:29,520","00:33,600","\"Well, no, no, you just have a hole going through your ball second this thing would kind of hold it together\""]
["00:33,600","00:38,640","\"You know I hate that ten million dollars no wait\""]
["00:38,640","00:44,360","\"What you fix it with like like a few thousand that's like cheating though\""]
["00:44,360","00:49,480","\"The whole point is that I've committed to that right that's your making you do it\""]
["00:49,480","00:55,360","\"No, you're basically yelling at him for not trying to weasel out of the hypothetical\""]
["00:55,360","00:58,440","\"I'm saying that you have to have it done\""]
["00:58,440","01:03,440","\"You know what, you're right. Never mind.\""]
["01:03,440","01:09,680","\"Look, it sounds extremely painful and uncomfortable and like just the very thought makes me like\""]
["01:09,680","01:10,680","\"sick to my stomach.\""]
["01:10,680","01:15,400","\"Okay, okay, okay, instead of one in the center, how about you have two gauges on each nut\""]
["01:15,400","01:17,960","\"and the ball is hanging exposed out of each nut?\""]
["01:17,960","01:19,960","\"That's even worse!\""]
["01:19,960","01:25,360","\"But now you get a hundred million dollars.\""]
["01:25,360","01:27,360","\"You can become a titan of industry with that.\""]
["01:27,360","01:30,040","\"for a lot of people with a hundred million dollars.\""]
["01:30,040","01:34,240","\"I'd consider that for that many figures,\""]
["01:34,240","01:35,920","\"I consider. - You're a hero.\""]
["01:35,920","01:37,680","\"You do that for me?\""]
["01:37,680","01:40,080","\"I'm not saying I'd give you all the money.\""]
["01:40,080","01:43,720","\"- I think you were talking more like world hunger, right?\""]
["01:43,720","01:47,640","\"- I mean, and I probably still would wanna start\""]
["01:47,640","01:50,000","\"some kind of media company too.\""]
["01:50,000","01:51,560","\"- That'd be cool. - Yeah, I'd open\""]
["01:51,560","01:53,400","\"like a, like a-- - Tomar Media Corp.\""]

["02:00,120","02:03,600","\"Like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but with Tomars.\""]
["02:03,600","02:11,320","\"Now, would you still do that if part of the condition is your foundation must state that\""]
["02:11,320","02:14,360","\"the reason you have that money is because you have gauges in your balls?\""]
["02:14,360","02:16,860","\"Uh...\""]
["02:16,860","02:22,320","\"I mean, that's a little embarrassing, but it's kind of like, how would people not find that out?\""]
["02:22,320","02:24,280","\"You just don't show them your balls?\""]
["02:24,280","02:25,480","\"Is that off the table?\""]
["02:25,480","02:26,480","\"Oh, I guess...\""]
["02:26,480","02:28,480","\"I never thought of that way\""]
["02:28,480","02:31,060","\"Okay, so Marth, think of this\""]
["02:31,060","02:40,440","\"You know those compasses that are like circles where you you rotate them to like close you have you see those you mean for for drawing\""]
["02:40,440","02:46,040","\"circles yeah, yeah, you rotated and it like it closes in kind of like a cool like Star Trek door\""]
["02:46,040","02:52,100","\"Yeah, okay, so you got that right now also on the back of the vibe headset you got that thing you twist the tight knit\""]
["02:52,100","02:55,560","\"Okay, yeah, the little knob so\""]
["02:56,080","02:58,080","\"Imagine you have your sphincter removed.\""]
["02:58,080","02:59,080","\"Ahhh!\""]
["02:59,080","03:04,080","\"And they have this compass put in as your new sphincter and you have to use that little dial on the back of the vibe\""]
["03:04,080","03:06,080","\"and have to set the open and close your asshole.\""]
["03:06,080","03:10,080","\"I have to manually operate my sphincter for the rest of my life.\""]
["03:10,080","03:12,080","\"Yeah, but you get paid.\""]
["03:12,080","03:14,080","\"$48 a second.\""]
["03:14,080","03:16,080","\"$48 a second, huh?\""]
["03:16,080","03:18,080","\"For the rest of your life.\""]
["03:18,080","03:20,080","\"That sounds like a lot of money, but I don't know.\""]
["03:20,080","03:23,080","\"I don't actually know that that's worth it.\""]
["03:23,080","03:28,300","\"Yeah, having a like broken butthole it was like you'd have to like replace it every like\""]
["03:28,300","03:33,000","\"Few months probably yeah that point I might as well just get like a colostin he bag\""]
["03:33,000","03:37,340","\"You wouldn't do that for $48 and a\""]
["03:37,340","03:43,320","\"Minute or a second a second he said that is that is that is a lot of good money\""]
["03:43,320","03:48,760","\"It's pretty good. There's two rates of pay that high and I make that 24/7\""]
["03:49,560","03:54,320","\"Yep for the rest of your life. Oh boy. That's basically unlimited money\""]
["03:54,320","03:58,040","\"But you do have to literally like manually open and close your asshole with a dial\""]
["03:58,040","04:03,540","\"Letting shit spill out. You don't even get to push it out. These ones are always these ones are always tough\""]
["04:03,540","04:09,320","\"Okay, wait, hold on if I have my asshole closed and I have to shit and I go what happens\""]
["04:09,320","04:12,280","\"You can't push you know those muscles\""]
["04:12,280","04:16,080","\"So are you saying like if I have to shit and I don't want to shit\""]
["04:16,080","04:21,160","\"I can just leave my asshole closed and then dump it all out at the end of the day. Yeah, but you might get sick\""]
["04:21,160","04:28,000","\"That's a risk that's worth taking. Oh, that is really good money. That's that's really good\""]
["04:28,000","04:34,320","\"What's that turn into what is that annually? You said it was 48 per second, right? Yep\""]
["04:34,320","04:40,400","\"It's a time 60 and that's per minute and then times 60. I already got how many seconds are in a year\""]
["04:40,400","04:43,400","\"So I would be making\""]
["04:44,640","04:47,600","\"1.5 trillion sorry I guess\""]
["04:47,600","04:56,880","\"$1.5 billion a year that's really solid I think I could make that work for me\""]
["04:56,880","05:04,760","\"yeah I think I would do the I would do the manual butthole for from 1.5 trillion a year now every time you spend money though\""]
["05:04,760","05:11,520","\"You have to tell them but still you have to tell them every time you spend money though that you have a crank that\""]
["05:11,560","05:15,600","\"Opens and closes your butt hole and that's where this money comes from\""]
["05:15,600","05:18,800","\"And jaxie leaves you and me\""]
["05:18,800","05:27,280","\"Like like you're trying to shit and the fucking dial breaks off and you fucked and you can't see back there\""]
["05:27,280","05:32,320","\"You could have a shit dial replacer like on staff for just such a nickname. I was gonna say\""]
["05:32,320","05:36,200","\"And if it's really that miserable you'd probably get it after the first time\""]
["05:36,320","05:42,400","\"I was gonna see what really forces me to keep this thing too like couldn't I also afford a hitman to kill the guy that?\""]
["05:42,400","05:48,600","\"That's gonna hold me to this. That's also the guy paying you though. I would assume oh I see so if I kill him my\""]
["05:48,600","05:55,160","\"Maybe I just put up with it long enough to just get like I do it for like a few years get a few billion and\""]
["05:55,160","05:59,320","\"Then and then terminate the deal and have a normal\""]
["06:00,560","06:07,840","\"Like emotional moment talked about a robotic asshole. I bet they both have robotic assholes. She does\""]
["06:07,840","06:13,700","\"I love how they render the eyes. Yeah, it's good looking meh\""]
["06:13,700","06:19,040","\"But like it's not ratchet and clank anymore now. It's just bitch and clank. I don't want to play\""]
["06:19,040","06:22,040","\"Like like I didn't pay for this\""]

["06:29,480","06:34,680","\"You did get slightly missed. Yeah, you got you got misled a little bit\""]
["06:34,680","06:40,760","\"I don't know tommorjour this part. How did you know?\""]
["06:40,760","06:46,880","\"From the shitty artwork. Oh, no, I'm just kidding. It's actually not bad. I'm just trolling. It's just a troll\""]
["06:53,880","06:55,320","\"Willian\""]
["06:55,320","06:58,360","\"It's like $78. I know right I\""]
["06:58,360","07:01,240","\"Could buy you so many gumballs\""]
["07:01,240","07:03,840","\"Why does this part animated like this?\""]
["07:03,840","07:05,600","\"What do you mean?\""]
["07:05,600","07:11,480","\"It looks different. Yeah, it's a kind of looks like they had a storyboard and they didn't have time to animate this part\""]
["07:11,480","07:14,520","\"So they just use the storyboard. I\""]
["07:14,520","07:19,720","\"Think this was intentional sure okay, well\""]
["07:22,160","07:23,800","\"- Buddy, bless you.\""]

["07:53,880","07:54,400","\"True.\""]
["07:54,400","08:00,360","\"Dude, so much of like 80s Simpsons like infiltrated fucking like the ethos of like\""]
["08:00,360","08:04,520","\"playground rumors to the point where it might have it might as well become\""]

["08:06,840","08:09,080","\"Dude, this area looks phenomenal.\""]
["08:09,080","08:11,080","\"This area, you get something real cool in it.\""]

["08:25,940","08:29,080","\"I can't believe how good that looks.\""]
["08:29,080","08:30,720","\"Look at that.\""]
["08:30,720","08:31,720","\"It's great.\""]
["08:31,720","08:32,720","\"That!\""]
["08:32,720","08:34,720","\"Look at that background.\""]
["08:34,720","08:37,280","\"Yeah, it's real cool.\""]
["08:37,280","08:38,480","\"Look at it on the other screen.\""]
["08:38,480","08:43,160","\"It's kind of more how it's supposed to look.\""]
["08:43,160","08:45,720","\"Shut up.\""]
["08:45,720","08:48,560","\"A flying sniper bot?\""]
["08:48,560","08:52,440","\"Shut up Titus on my birthday\""]
["08:52,440","08:55,660","\"They should make the next grant the thought of with this engine\""]
["08:55,660","09:00,880","\"Yeah, they I don't know if this is the same one they use for spider-man\""]
["09:00,880","09:03,200","\"The spider-man\""]
["09:03,200","09:05,500","\"It's the say it's they're both in somniac\""]
["09:05,500","09:07,780","\"So I don't know if they use like the same physics engine\""]
["09:07,780","09:13,880","\"But I'd assume if they had one line around unpopular opinion time. I fucking hate that game\""]
["09:14,480","09:20,200","\"Wait, what game the spider-man game it's kind of a short game. It's a maniac's one\""]
["09:20,200","09:27,340","\"It's boring as hell. Oh the one the one they made for the ps4 like yeah swinging around and that feels like nothing\""]
["09:27,340","09:33,080","\"You're doing literally nothing. It's like a sassan's creed holding up just run up in a tire building never disagree\""]
["09:33,080","09:38,480","\"I probably played about 15 to 20 hours that game just doing mindless crap\""]
["09:38,480","09:43,320","\"And it is just like another and you don't want to do half the like many games and crap\""]
["09:43,320","09:45,320","\"They give you because they're not fun\""]
["09:45,320","09:49,000","\"But all I wanted to do is swing around with like lots of weight\""]
["09:49,000","09:51,520","\"That's all I want\""]
["09:51,520","09:55,280","\"But like you can jump off of buildings and then hit the ground and there's no consequence\""]
["09:55,280","09:59,580","\"Suck that is that Miles Morales one any good for the ps5?\""]
["09:59,580","10:06,120","\"It's about the same okay their games that like wouldn't be good if you weren't spider-man\""]
["10:06,120","10:08,360","\"You are spider-man\""]
["10:08,360","10:11,200","\"So maybe you could you could argue that that makes it okay\""]
["10:11,200","10:15,920","\"But it's not like you're doing anything like super out of the ordinary with it look\""]
["10:15,920","10:20,720","\"There's two categories of people right people who like shitty games people who don't like shit\""]
["10:20,720","10:23,600","\"No, I'm kidding. There's there is two categories of people though, right?\""]
["10:23,600","10:25,600","\"one where\""]
["10:25,600","10:27,600","\"You can be you can be content\""]
["10:27,600","10:32,480","\"With doing nothing and the game does everything for you and you just enjoy relaxing to it, right?\""]
["10:33,160","10:37,800","\"Or you can have 80 d autism where you really want to be doing every little thing yourself\""]
["10:37,800","10:44,080","\"And that's me I feel like a lot of people are a healthy medium. I'm not I definitely have fucking\""]
["10:44,080","10:45,880","\"When I say a lot of people I mean myself\""]
["10:45,880","10:50,800","\"I like all sorts of different types of games when it comes to like swinging around a momentum\""]
["10:50,800","10:56,440","\"I want to be doing everything because that's the whole point and I get that that's what makes the ps2 one still fun\""]
["10:56,440","11:01,540","\"Yeah, no like it's it's definitely like we replayed it. That's the most recent\""]
["11:02,000","11:05,600","\"But it's funny like trying out all the different moves on people yeah\""]
["11:05,600","11:10,360","\"But the swinging feels amazing to this day because it just feels yeah, it's still really fun\""]
["11:10,360","11:16,160","\"But I will say the ps4 one the like all the different suits were really cool. Yeah\""]
["11:16,160","11:22,120","\"There's certain things I really like about the ps4 one, but it looks really good\""]
["11:22,120","11:28,740","\"I kind of disagree with you on the swinging thing, but it's I see what you mean lock new moves it gets better\""]
["11:28,740","11:35,780","\"I was gonna say the game definitely like yeah like when you have your full move said it's definitely more fun to move around\""]
["11:35,780","11:41,540","\"But still the PS2 one was fun from the beginning and you just upgrading it. Oh look at that little guy\""]
["11:41,540","11:42,540","\"You all right?\""]
["11:42,540","11:46,720","\"That was quite the landing. Oh look it's pink yelling\""]
["11:46,720","11:54,800","\"It's shwank. I'm ratchet. I'm here to find I think it was Gary's apprentice Gary bras\""]
["11:54,800","12:02,660","\"I like how he tried to say it like like he's pretending like he doesn't know to a stork lurk like oh\""]
["12:02,660","12:09,340","\"I kind of wanted to buy this this movie. It's like an erotic thing. Maybe I don't know. It's like a gift\""]
["12:09,340","12:12,400","\"Maybe we could work together\""]
["12:12,400","12:17,400","\"Don't touch it. Don't touch that thing. Do not make a great partner\""]
["12:19,960","12:26,280","\"How about this if things go badly, which they won't we go our separate ways no questions asked\""]
["12:26,280","12:29,120","\"team I\""]
["12:29,120","12:34,800","\"Need to wear you on my back you look like someone I know so I'm gonna implicitly trust you\""]

["12:37,760","12:40,440","\"Like you all right here it is\""]
["12:40,440","12:43,600","\"so yeah\""]
["12:45,560","12:47,560","\"That's fun and\""]
["12:47,560","12:53,160","\"You can use these at any point in time. It's not just this level. See this is awesome\""]
["12:53,160","12:58,160","\"This level is kind of like open-worldly. It's gonna say now you're just in the game destiny\""]
["12:58,160","13:04,400","\"Little bit they just wanted to give you like a big like open zone to kind of like test these out I think\""]
["13:04,400","13:09,560","\"And they thought what better place than destiny. That's true. Oh\""]
["13:11,360","13:15,520","\"So when you're flying around on those boots is there any way for you to smash in the shit and hurt yourself?\""]
["13:15,520","13:19,400","\"I don't think so see that's what makes it boring\""]
["13:19,400","13:23,080","\"Mmm after like it's cool to get to places faster\""]
["13:23,080","13:26,800","\"But wouldn't that be cool if you could actually like think about what you're doing is you doing?\""]
["13:26,800","13:31,960","\"Yeah, it would be cool if you could eat shit then there'd be a reason to actually put shit everywhere so you could dodge it\""]
["13:31,960","13:40,720","\"This is kind of the the big like open-worldy level like you can do a lot here that I'm probably not gonna do\""]
["13:40,840","13:47,360","\"These things like you can like from from just like a standing like point you can like get on them and start going\""]
["13:47,360","13:49,800","\"You can get going pretty fast pretty\""]
["13:49,800","13:56,680","\"Pretty quickly. Yeah, so you can use them to kind of like cheese jumps and shit like that sort of like Mario Odyssey style\""]
["13:56,680","14:04,720","\"Yes an archivist just what we wanted was he who I wanted to talk to\""]
["14:04,720","14:07,760","\"Hey fuck head are you who I want to talk to?\""]
["14:07,760","14:20,120","\"You know that we can totally do stuff with each other and our babies won't turn out\""]
["14:20,120","14:28,660","\"You know, I love that guys design. Yeah, they're neat looking those like alligator dudes every design has been good\""]
["14:28,660","14:31,160","\"They're very cartoony\""]
["14:31,160","14:35,260","\"They like I'll hook you up with a sweet piece of armor. I dug up\""]
["14:35,260","14:37,640","\"Shrine\""]
["14:37,640","14:39,640","\"And I'll totally help\""]
["14:39,640","14:49,320","\"Radical one last thing shrines won't open if they're bad vibes near my is these guys are like the ninja turtles and bebop had a baby\""]
["14:49,320","14:51,640","\"Yeah, a little bit\""]
["14:51,640","14:58,840","\"Yeah, okay, you can run into those that's cool if you run into an enemy take damage\""]
["14:58,840","15:10,660","\"Did you make a comment earlier about things getting electrocuted and going \"\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!\"\"\""]
["15:10,660","15:28,640","\"Yeah, I mean this delivered. Yeah, you're gonna have these funbies going out. This game gets pretty cool when there's like these big encounters like this, because it's just fucking explosions and shit everywhere. Kind of turns into a mess, but that's where it gets fun. If I played this as a kid it would be like the best thing in the world.\""]
["15:28,640","15:30,640","\"Yeah, it's definitely like\""]
["15:30,640","15:34,120","\"Like I feel like if you're if you're still\""]
["15:34,120","15:40,840","\"Impressed by video games being fun. I know that sounds bad, but like\""]
["15:40,840","15:46,400","\"You know like at a point you've played so many fucking video games that it's just like alright\""]
["15:46,400","15:51,680","\"You know you start to recognize the mechanics that you see repeated over and over and over again\""]
["15:51,680","15:55,840","\"That's what I'm saying, but uh the older you get the more you notice it\""]
["15:56,760","16:03,360","\"Yeah, the more you're just like I want to experience something new. I still think that this does enough to where I really enjoyed this game\""]
["16:03,360","16:06,640","\"Do they share weapon loadouts? Yes, they do\""]
["16:06,640","16:13,980","\"How convenient the official reason for that is that the the sales robot can't tell you guys apart\""]
["16:13,980","16:18,500","\"So the sales robot is like a multi-dimensional being\""]
["16:18,500","16:25,760","\"Yeah, I think she just holds all your shit or she's some kind of hive mind or something where like they're all and they're all\""]
["16:25,760","16:29,680","\"Quantum linked between timelines I guess naturally\""]
["16:29,680","16:32,480","\"What suck if they didn't\""]
["16:32,480","16:40,420","\"I mean I would have thought it'd be cool if you just made their play styles different and gave them separate equipment, but you know\""]
["16:40,420","16:46,480","\"I kind of disagree with that like every game that does that it never works out\""]
["16:46,480","16:49,240","\"You're always like I wish I was playing the other one right now\""]
["16:49,240","16:52,360","\"Yeah, the only thing that they have different is like the wrench and the hammer\""]
["16:52,480","16:56,240","\"They're they just kind of functioned like very very slightly differently\""]
["16:56,240","17:00,600","\"Where the wrench just kind of goes out in the straight line and the hammer goes in an arc\""]
["17:00,600","17:03,240","\"Actually, I remember Batman Arkham City\""]
["17:03,240","17:09,840","\"Like you play as Catwoman and I remember there was a part where I remember it was like a it was like a pre-ordered bonus or like a\""]
["17:09,840","17:11,680","\"special edition bonus where it was like\""]
["17:11,680","17:14,640","\"plays Catwoman and I was like I\""]
["17:14,640","17:16,240","\"Didn't pre-order the game\""]
["17:16,240","17:22,420","\"But I remember it being sold to me as some kind of bonus that I was getting and like every time that I was playing as Catwoman\""]
["17:22,420","17:27,580","\"I was like, I wish I wasn't playing as Catwoman right now. I'm pretty sure the game starts you off as Catwoman, right?\""]
["17:27,580","17:35,060","\"Maybe it doesn't pretty early on. I think she's pretty important to the story too, so that game would be really fucking weird without her\""]
["17:35,060","17:38,200","\"But I just remember like hating those parts\""]
["17:44,440","17:49,960","\"I can't believe they're all dead. You turned them into soup. This is something where this zone\""]
["17:49,960","17:55,420","\"I kind of questions maybe they could have done it on last gen hardware, but you're moving a little fast\""]
["17:55,420","18:01,280","\"Like this seems like a like a ps4 game would have had trouble like loading you in\""]
["18:01,280","18:05,820","\"Really? Yeah, I put this game where you were a shark called man-eater\""]
["18:05,820","18:06,880","\"Yeah\""]
["18:06,880","18:12,600","\"for and like I upgraded my speed too much and the game was just like not having it\""]
["18:12,600","18:19,560","\"Hey, Jaxie played that on the PS5. I'm a washerner, but we're in red and great on that. Yeah, that was an all-right game\""]
["18:19,560","18:23,760","\"It's it's fun for the first few hours and then you know like okay, I kind of yeah\""]
["18:23,760","18:28,140","\"Then you get you into a bit of a loop there now that can also yo yo yo together\""]
["18:28,140","18:34,680","\"I'd be great if you could get Mike judge on as a guest just say and just throwing that out there\""]
["18:34,840","18:36,840","\"Yeah, Mike you need to come on\""]
["18:36,840","18:41,400","\"On the only place yeah, just literally just so he can sit in the corner and go boy\""]
["18:41,400","18:47,240","\"Like judges one of my heroes. Yeah, dude King of the Hill is I\""]
["18:47,240","18:51,460","\"Remember thinking it was kind of boring as a kid and now I think it's fucking hilarious\""]
["18:51,460","18:57,760","\"Yeah, it's it's like legitimately one of the like best adult cartoons ever made it's very like\""]
["18:57,760","19:02,920","\"When you're kid you're just kind of like these guys aren't wacky or telling jokes, but as an adult you're like\""]
["19:02,920","19:06,080","\"I've met this guy. I know this fucking guy.\""]
["19:06,080","19:07,720","\"Is there a good way to watch that now?\""]
["19:07,720","19:10,360","\"King of the Hill? It was streaming on something.\""]
["19:10,360","19:13,160","\"I was gonna say it was on, I think, like Hulu for a while.\""]
["19:13,160","19:14,960","\"I don't know what it's on right now.\""]
["19:14,960","19:15,920","\"I'm sick of Netflix.\""]
["19:15,920","19:19,800","\"I've been like alternating where I just kind of get one and then like\""]
["19:19,800","19:24,000","\"have it for a couple months and then once I feel like there's nothing to watch on this,\""]
["19:24,000","19:25,840","\"I like cancel it and get another one.\""]
["19:25,840","19:28,200","\"It's getting to be where there's way too fucking many of them.\""]
["19:28,200","19:29,800","\"It's basically cable at this point.\""]
["19:30,280","19:35,180","\"Disney Plus was already feeling like, \"\"Alright, now there's a lot.\"\"\""]
["19:35,180","19:39,280","\"And then Paramount Plus came out, or Paramount, whatever.\""]
["19:39,280","19:41,280","\"But the Paramount one came out.\""]
["19:41,280","19:46,380","\"And I just did the trial of it so we could walk Jackass the movie too.\""]
["19:46,380","19:47,780","\"I let it expire.\""]
["19:47,780","19:51,680","\"I actually found like Hulu has gotten better shit than Netflix recently.\""]
["19:51,680","19:52,680","\"Really?\""]
["19:52,680","19:54,600","\"My name on Hulu is Jesus.\""]
["19:54,600","19:55,600","\"I don't know why.\""]
["19:55,600","19:57,200","\"You do it on purpose?\""]
["19:57,200","20:01,600","\"Maybe a guy named Jesus just came here and logged in once and it's not even your account.\""]
["20:01,600","20:02,600","\"Maybe.\""]
["20:02,600","20:05,840","\"That's such a satisfying weapon.\""]
["20:05,840","20:06,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:06,840","20:10,000","\"It reminds me a little bit of like the Spartan laser in Halo.\""]
["20:10,000","20:13,240","\"Ah, that was the most satisfying thing to get kills with.\""]
["20:13,240","20:14,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:14,240","20:18,280","\"I think because it takes like a little while to charge unlike the rockets it just like\""]
["20:18,280","20:21,000","\"feels really good when you murder someone with it.\""]
["20:21,000","20:22,960","\"Leave alone.\""]

["20:27,120","20:28,920","\"Yeah, it was the best.\""]
["20:28,920","20:30,600","\"That guy ended up kind of being right.\""]
["20:30,600","20:33,640","\"It's kind of a fucked up thing.\""]
["20:33,640","20:36,120","\"Wow, it has been like 10 years of still going on.\""]
["20:36,120","20:38,680","\"Yeah, that's just fucking nuts.\""]
["20:38,680","20:41,040","\"Where she's basically like,\""]
["20:41,040","20:45,200","\"I don't know how crazy she actually is or like what,\""]
["20:45,560","20:53,140","\"Like, but like it's really really hard to actually get like power of attorney or like a conservatorship over like a functioning adult\""]
["20:53,140","21:00,040","\"Yeah, so the the fact that they've managed to do it for so long despite it being like this big public thing where she's like\""]
["21:00,040","21:03,220","\"Yeah, I specifically don't want this guy running it\""]
["21:03,220","21:07,480","\"I remember like being like is that guy still alive like three years ago?\""]
["21:07,480","21:14,260","\"Scary fucking porn. He has a scary porn. I don't even know that. He says very hardcore porn videos\""]
