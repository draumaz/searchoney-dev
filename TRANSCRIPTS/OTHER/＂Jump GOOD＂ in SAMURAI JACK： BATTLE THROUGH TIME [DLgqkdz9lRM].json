["01:36,640","01:39,080","\"when it was canceled versus when it came back.\""]
["01:39,080","01:41,080","\"If that show never came back, it would--\""]
["01:41,080","01:43,800","\"- It would have been one of the funniest shows,\""]
["01:43,800","01:45,040","\"animated shows, I think.\""]
["01:45,040","01:47,880","\"I actually, I wasn't even a huge fan of Samurai Jack\""]
["01:47,880","01:49,760","\"as a kid, but I definitely have watched a lot of episodes.\""]
["01:49,760","01:51,720","\"So some of these things, like these references,\""]

["01:53,520","01:55,400","\"I didn't really like it that much as a kid,\""]
["01:55,400","01:58,720","\"but then as an adult, I re-watched some of the old ones\""]
["01:58,720","01:59,920","\"and they were really good.\""]
["01:59,920","02:01,880","\"- Yeah, no, that'd be the exact same thing.\""]
["02:01,880","02:03,840","\"Especially when the final season of the show came out,\""]
["02:03,840","02:06,280","\"I went back and I tried to re-watch some of the episodes.\""]
["02:06,280","02:08,760","\"- I feel like there's certain things\""]
["02:08,760","02:11,400","\"that you almost have to make stuff\""]
["02:11,400","02:13,600","\"or understand animation for it to be like,\""]
["02:13,600","02:15,280","\"this looks really good.\""]
["02:15,280","02:18,040","\"- Yeah, it's a kind of an appreciate, I just thought.\""]
["02:18,040","02:22,840","\"'Cause there's a lot of physically dark settings\""]
["02:22,840","02:23,680","\"and things like that.\""]
