["03:50,640","03:54,800","\"Shatter to my friends in New York. It's like axolotls\""]
["03:54,800","03:59,440","\"They're like a pet in other places, but here you can't get them because\""]

["04:41,160","04:46,560","\"That used to happen to me a lot it blows it really has nothing to do with schedule at this point\""]

["04:49,840","04:50,880","\"I\""]
["04:50,880","04:56,280","\"Think you can fix that if you just keep forcing yourself to wake up at like six and then staying up like or not six\""]
["04:56,280","05:01,240","\"Fucking like eight. Yeah, you just have to wake up at the same time go to bed this is every day and also stop drinking soda\""]

["05:25,020","05:30,960","\"So bad, I know and it's really frustrating though when uh, what do you like?\""]
["05:30,960","05:36,240","\"You know what I want everyone's always like if you work out you feel more energized, but like that's never worked for me once in my life\""]
["05:36,240","05:40,680","\"Who could exercise redoing all sorts even recently?\""]
["05:40,680","05:46,040","\"I'm like I'm in probably the best shape of been in a long time and I still any time I exercise I want to go pass out\""]
["05:46,040","05:48,480","\"Well, I feel a lot of days when you exercise\""]
["05:48,480","05:53,060","\"Yeah, but if you if you like don't exercise and then you just have a normal day\""]
["05:53,060","05:54,680","\"Mmm\""]
["05:54,680","06:00,320","\"You got tons of energy. I suppose not really but then you're not exercising and then you lose the energy\""]
["06:00,320","06:04,040","\"Yes, everything we do sucks in his bad for us. Yep\""]
["06:04,040","06:06,600","\"Everything is a downside\""]
["06:06,600","06:12,380","\"Can we please turn off this awful fucking game as soon as we see what this does? I hope it doesn't save\""]
["06:12,380","06:15,400","\"Can't you save?\""]
["06:15,400","06:19,240","\"You really wanted to turn it off before that okay, I like it again\""]

["06:24,440","06:28,800","\"South Park meets\""]
["06:28,800","06:31,800","\"as told by ginger\""]
["06:31,800","06:33,800","\"that would be awful\""]
["06:33,800","06:35,800","\"that would be fucking terrible\""]
["06:35,800","06:38,800","\"it would happen in the gingerverse too\""]
["06:38,800","06:40,800","\"so it's as told by ginger's writers\""]
["06:40,800","06:42,800","\"you know what probably could have happened\""]
["06:42,800","06:43,800","\"she raided south park\""]
["06:43,800","06:45,800","\"you know what could have happened but they didn't\""]
["06:45,800","06:47,800","\"thankfully as told by ginger meets the rugrats\""]
["06:47,800","06:49,800","\"i'm surprised they didn't\""]
["06:49,800","06:51,800","\"can you imagine that she would be babysitting them\""]
["06:51,800","06:52,800","\"or something\""]
["06:52,800","06:54,800","\"yeah well they did well\""]
["06:54,800","06:55,800","\"doorberries meat\""]
["06:55,800","06:56,800","\"that one sucked ass\""]
["06:56,800","07:01,240","\"It doesn't work at all you're watching this is unnatural this is evil can wait\""]
["07:01,240","07:04,200","\"Can she talk to babies like she can talk to animals?\""]
["07:04,200","07:08,040","\"Could she was that the was that the the pitch was like oh?\""]
["07:08,040","07:14,140","\"Much like animals. She can also talk to babies. I remember watch. I don't remember that. Oh, so they couldn't understand her\""]
["07:14,140","07:20,880","\"They know they can understand her would she could talk despite the dogs what I remember. Oh, he's Bruce. Yeah, that was weird\""]
["07:20,880","07:24,900","\"Try to think of other horrible crossovers they could do rograts meets\""]
["07:25,840","07:30,520","\"That's not a cartoon. That'd be good actually I'd watch that\""]
["07:30,520","07:34,360","\"Rugrats meets uh, we have to cook\""]
["07:34,360","07:41,520","\"Rugrats meet savior. I get it. There you go. That would be fun. No, I'm gonna rock. Yeah, Rugrats meets Aaron will be awesome\""]
["07:41,520","07:47,360","\"You said the worst cross over there. I guess that would be a good one. I just did they not do a Rugrats meets\""]
["07:47,360","07:51,120","\"Hey, I feel like they did that but maybe I'm wrong this\""]
["07:51,120","07:55,680","\"You know what the Simpsons meets Rugrats would be fucking bizarre and creepy. Did we go point to it?\""]
["07:55,680","08:00,960","\"Yeah, just be so stupid they would make Lisa date Tommy Scooby-Doo me\""]
["08:00,960","08:08,360","\"Scooby-Doo me too Scooby-Doo\""]

["08:25,140","08:29,140","\"clan album. I'm trying to think of the all-time worst crossover ever.\""]
["08:29,140","08:33,040","\"Oh, real monsters crosses over with.\""]
["08:33,040","08:35,000","\"The Simpsons. That would be so bad.\""]
["08:35,000","08:38,240","\"It could be good actually if it was like a treehouse horror.\""]
["08:38,240","08:41,040","\"That would make sense. If it was just a regular episode.\""]
["08:41,040","08:45,740","\"I feel like the Simpsons would just do like a parody of that now.\""]
["08:45,740","08:50,140","\"Because they started making those treehouse of horrors like not even, not even horror\""]
["08:50,140","08:54,740","\"movies. They do parodies like, yeah, like Superman or something. It'd be like weird.\""]
["08:54,740","08:59,520","\"I don't like that. I wanted to watch our real monsters as a kid, but every time I got home from school was just ending\""]
["08:59,520","09:05,420","\"So I missed out on it entirely. You just thought it was like the most amazing show in the world. Just look cool\""]
["09:05,420","09:08,580","\"I like the black and white monster and the little purple guy\""]
["09:08,580","09:14,980","\"The guy who holds his eyeballs. No, I was he was disgusting. I didn't want to watch him at all\""]
["09:14,980","09:17,700","\"Where's that?\""]
["09:17,700","09:20,820","\"I don't know there. Go fuck\""]
["09:20,820","09:23,060","\"Jesus\""]
["09:23,060","09:26,700","\"My god, oh it's a parachute. Oh\""]
["09:26,700","09:29,940","\"Good boy. I\""]
["09:29,940","09:35,940","\"Really thought there was gonna be like a second part to that joke like something else comes out in the eats and or something\""]
["09:35,940","09:41,160","\"The combat in this game is truly abysmal. Yeah. No, you just fucking mash\""]
["09:41,160","09:46,060","\"Like you have a heavy attack for most of it. Yeah, it's so stupid\""]
["09:46,060","09:53,000","\"Yeah, do you have a block but yourself? I don't think so. No, so it's just you hitting that till the the block goes\""]
["09:53,000","09:58,640","\"down basically yeah yeah it's not it's not particularly deep I can do that\""]
["09:58,640","10:05,320","\"though that's another move I have absolutely astounding every moment with\""]
["10:05,320","10:10,680","\"this game is a joy do you think that that's what the the fucking director of\""]
["10:10,680","10:15,560","\"this game said as soon as they played it for the first time you think I don't\""]
["10:15,560","10:19,440","\"know tear rolled down their cheek I know I think you know I was looking at a\""]
["10:19,440","10:24,600","\"behind the scenes thing of Ghostbusters and they were saying when they shot that shot of them running down to New York City\""]
["10:24,600","10:27,380","\"He was like I knew it was gonna be a hit right then. Oh\""]
["10:27,380","10:31,040","\"But if you're making this you have to have the exact opposite feeling\""]
["10:31,040","10:36,140","\"Yeah, like oh no. Oh fucking no. We made this game. I\""]
["10:36,140","10:43,620","\"Don't know though cuz games like but this isn't like the worst game ever though. It's but you would realize it's not a hit\""]
["10:44,280","10:48,040","\"I probably this game didn't retail at full price\""]
["10:48,040","10:51,280","\"I know that there's nothing innovative about it like at the end of the day you can have\""]
["10:51,280","10:55,640","\"Interesting characters and interesting whatever marketing, but if it's not fun to play it\""]
["10:55,640","10:58,440","\"Which just doesn't seem very fun\""]
["10:58,440","11:04,400","\"I'm just gonna follow this tube because it's glowing and that seems like like the logical progression\""]
["11:04,400","11:07,100","\"See farting he's doing something\""]
["11:07,100","11:10,240","\"I think he is farting\""]

["11:15,240","11:17,240","\"Yeah, this is just a normal office guy.\""]
["11:17,240","11:18,240","\"You're a varmint?\""]
["11:18,240","11:20,240","\"Probably.\""]
["11:20,240","11:24,240","\"Is there like a like an actual like classification for varmint?\""]
["11:24,240","11:27,240","\"I thought it was like a slang term.\""]
["11:27,240","11:31,240","\"Yeah, thought it was like the guy from the Looney Tunes that shoots the guns up and down.\""]
["11:31,240","11:32,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:32,240","11:33,240","\"Anti-ocemedite.\""]

["11:59,320","12:06,120","\"What's it like a new movie to right now a new character? Yeah, new movie to enjoy the classic budge. Okay\""]
["12:06,120","12:08,360","\"He's a Komodo dragon. What's his name?\""]
["12:08,360","12:15,740","\"Uh, um, so okay, there's Daffy bugs spike the dragon. That's a fucking\""]
["12:15,740","12:23,240","\"No, he's not a Komodo dragon. That's too much dude too far. Look I like a little dragon up\""]
["12:23,240","12:26,280","\"George George\""]
["12:26,280","12:29,600","\"Well, I'm trying to think of all the others bugs Daffy\""]
