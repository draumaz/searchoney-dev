["00:23,280","00:28,720","\"we had to go in the pod again and lightning struck it and we switched back but we learned a lot about\""]
["00:28,720","00:35,440","\"each other and then Tomar left. Tomar's a coward. Oh and then Tomar came back.\""]
["00:35,440","00:39,440","\"Always runs when his friends need it. I was just looking at the interface to make sure\""]
["00:39,440","00:45,760","\"everything was okay. Tomar you came back I knew you would. I had my dad's Tomar but you pulled through.\""]
