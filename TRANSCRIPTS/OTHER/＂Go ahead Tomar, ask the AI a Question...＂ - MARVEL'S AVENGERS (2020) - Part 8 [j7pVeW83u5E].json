["05:48,620","05:50,620","\"No, is that good news?\""]
["05:50,780","05:56,620","\"We're only 9% through the campaign and the rest of the game is just boring robot missions. It's so awesome\""]

["06:01,220","06:04,940","\"Look that's my oh you make you have to make a strike team\""]

["06:10,720","06:12,900","\"This is fucking weird so\""]
["06:12,900","06:19,680","\"Dude, that took us what like two hours again. They introduced multiplayer. Yeah, like I think I think closer to four or five hours\""]
["06:19,680","06:20,520","\"I\""]
["06:20,520","06:24,320","\"So where's the campaign because it is this part of the campaign? I don't know what this is\""]
["06:24,320","06:30,720","\"This is a campaign mission where you have to play this part online. I don't think you I think you can just do it yourself\""]
["06:30,720","06:35,600","\"We could select heroes and companions. This is really is actually confusing the shit out of me\""]
["06:35,600","06:41,960","\"Why is she not showing? Yeah, they just hit you with a bunch of new systems, but didn't rather to explain how any of them work\""]
["06:41,960","06:45,080","\"I'm sure they did but like oh just just from like\""]
["06:46,080","06:50,920","\"This should be simpler. I guess is what I'm trying to say. I guess let's just launch the mission as the Hulk\""]
["06:50,920","07:04,200","\"At least I sure hope so why is she talking through a filter she's right next to him. He looks anxious\""]
["07:04,200","07:07,820","\"You're just waiting for it to load. This is what they make you. Oh\""]
["07:11,920","07:17,760","\"They're both like like rocking back and forth. They both are like she's getting angrier and she's just terrified\""]
["07:17,760","07:21,600","\"She's like rocking back and forth like she's psychosis or something\""]
["07:21,600","07:28,660","\"Why is he the Hulk already and why didn't he take a shirt off before he turned that was a fucking insanely long load?\""]
["07:28,660","07:30,660","\"Holy shit\""]
["07:30,660","07:37,240","\"Isn't this like almost entirely on the hard drive already or no wait. We're playing this on PC. It's all on the hard drive\""]
["07:39,400","07:42,900","\"That's kind of fun. I'm a big baby. Yeah bound along\""]
["07:42,900","07:46,740","\"Tactical awareness. Oh look up on the left\""]
["07:46,740","07:49,640","\"Or you could just do that\""]
["07:49,640","07:53,040","\"Hulk you fucking\""]
["07:53,040","07:59,480","\"I feel like we're playing nothing now. I feel like there's no actual good goal. This does feel like a different game\""]
["07:59,480","08:02,640","\"There's an elite a me in it near you I\""]
["08:02,640","08:06,760","\"Think that's all they made in this the rest this is just like\""]
["08:07,760","08:10,380","\"Randomly built levels by different teams.\""]
["08:10,380","08:12,980","\"\"\"Cest containing special resources nearby.\"\"\""]
["08:12,980","08:14,260","\"I can't fucking believe this.\""]
["08:14,260","08:16,260","\"Do you think this is procedurally generated?\""]
["08:16,260","08:18,060","\"What the fuck?\""]
["08:18,060","08:18,860","\"*laughs*\""]
["08:18,860","08:20,060","\"I don't actually know.\""]

["08:21,460","08:22,160","\"Yeah, go on-\""]
["08:22,160","08:25,460","\"Go toward that little cube that it's directing you at.\""]
["08:25,460","08:26,460","\"That seems so-\""]
["08:26,460","08:29,960","\"Oh wow, all that was just so you could get this-\""]
["08:29,960","08:32,960","\"It's turned into like Assassin's Creed, like instant-\""]
["08:32,960","08:34,560","\"Like old Assassin's Creed.\""]
["08:34,560","08:37,160","\"You're just collecting random shit\""]
["08:37,160","08:39,500","\"in a big open empty world\""]
["08:39,500","08:42,240","\"dude you know how like all new games are kinda\""]
["08:42,240","08:46,920","\"they're for like everyone to play so like they overly simplify everything\""]
["08:46,920","08:51,560","\"i suppose i cannot see a mom or dad understanding what the fuck just happened\""]
["08:51,560","08:56,440","\"like that is gonna confuse the absolute fuck out of normal people\""]
["08:56,440","08:58,280","\"okay uh... he won't drop\""]
["08:58,280","09:00,680","\"okay there we go\""]
["09:00,680","09:03,720","\"so what's the objective that you're just trying to get to the for the robots\""]
["09:03,720","09:05,760","\"for the jar this thing that's the plot\""]
["09:05,760","09:11,840","\"Apparently I think that is our current mission is we're trying to get a part and that and that I just have a hunch\""]
["09:11,840","09:13,080","\"That's gonna be the rest of the game\""]
["09:13,080","09:17,040","\"I could totally see them like looking at that loading screen of them like awkwardly\""]
["09:17,040","09:22,280","\"Restlessly rocking back and forth and moms and dad just being like I think it's broken. Let's turn it off\""]
["09:22,280","09:28,380","\"Yeah, cuz also you could click stuff. It shows you like clickable stuff. It's loading. It's like that's that's very\""]
["09:28,380","09:33,280","\"Usually a loading screen you can't interact. I mean I think they were trying to make it so it's like all right\""]
["09:33,280","09:37,840","\"Well, you can go through inventory and equipment who stuff while you're waiting or it just reads this\""]
["09:37,840","09:42,500","\"It's a little bit confusing again. We totally skipped over shit, but still that was on us a little bit\""]
["09:42,500","09:43,840","\"uh\""]
["09:43,840","09:47,560","\"I love front of your eyes this big fucking idiot\""]

["09:54,320","10:01,040","\"Okay, wait, it's looks like it's now directing you over that wait, you know\""]
["10:01,360","10:03,960","\"Everything about this game is it does not read well\""]
["10:03,960","10:10,000","\"Yeah, I think there's a little behind you you have to be really get on this building that thing whatever that white thing is right there\""]
["10:10,000","10:11,160","\"Shouldn't you be right towards that?\""]
["10:11,160","10:15,920","\"There's there's a thing here. It's it's a chest. It's trying to get me to open this chest, but I don't know how to get to it\""]
["10:15,920","10:21,280","\"Okay, I'll try climbing go on top of the building. Okay. Let me get air-fed. There's something you can break through\""]
["10:21,280","10:26,480","\"Oh\""]
["10:26,480","10:28,560","\"my god\""]
["10:28,560","10:31,440","\"This feels really okay. I'm stupid\""]

["11:15,040","11:19,040","\"Die you fucking what is the point of being a big Hulk?\""]
["11:19,040","11:24,520","\"When these guys take fucking six hits why yeah the tradeoff should be he takes long to punch or attack\""]
["11:24,520","11:30,160","\"Yeah, it's less hits overall. I don't feel like the Hulk at all. I feel like Nico Bellic\""]
["11:30,160","11:34,200","\"Nico Bellic GTA 4 I know I\""]
["11:34,200","11:40,420","\"Love Nico Bellic that voice actor apparently got the long end of the stick\""]

["11:44,500","11:49,420","\"We know there was a whole thing where like each of those actors like oh I always thought the long end of the stick\""]
["11:49,420","11:51,640","\"Man he got hit really hard with the longer end of the stick\""]
["11:51,640","11:52,480","\"Oh no.\""]

["11:56,920","12:01,120","\"- No, I was, it's like if two people broke a stick in half,\""]
["12:01,120","12:04,360","\"and like as if that stick had some intrinsic value,\""]
["12:04,360","12:06,000","\"and then you got the short end.\""]
["12:06,000","12:07,680","\"- So are we just gonna hold this place now?\""]
["12:07,680","12:10,800","\"- No, I think the story was that like all the main actors\""]

["12:53,840","12:55,400","\"- I feel like that's a fair way to pay people.\""]
["12:55,400","12:57,920","\"- But a form of royalty would make sense,\""]
["12:57,920","12:59,800","\"even if it's not a percentage of revenue.\""]
["12:59,800","13:01,320","\"If it's just like, \"\"Hey, every copy of the game\""]
["13:01,320","13:04,800","\"\"\"that gets sold will give you a nickel or something like that.\"\"\""]
["13:04,800","13:06,920","\"Or just something.\""]
["13:06,920","13:08,680","\"- Yeah, that's what I mean, like a little slice\""]
["13:08,680","13:10,080","\"of every copy-- - It'll give you like 25 cents.\""]
["13:10,080","13:11,040","\"- That seems fair.\""]
["13:11,040","13:13,400","\"I feel like that also incentivizes\""]
["13:13,400","13:15,680","\"that voice actors do a better job.\""]
["13:15,680","13:17,200","\"- Yeah, I would think so, yeah.\""]

["13:26,960","13:30,920","\"- You do in the current SAG after a game contract,\""]
["13:30,920","13:32,960","\"depending on how many copies the game sells,\""]
["13:32,960","13:36,520","\"you do get bonus payments of like a few thousand bucks\""]
["13:36,520","13:39,520","\"for each, like a few hundred thousand copies sold\""]
["13:39,520","13:40,440","\"or something like that.\""]
["13:40,440","13:41,440","\"- That's a start.\""]

["13:51,480","13:53,480","\"And these guys kill you super fucking fast.\""]

["14:48,060","14:54,700","\"okay yeah this feels like they designed some like really generic modular\""]
["14:54,700","14:59,700","\"goals so that they could avoid like building the rest of the game this fucking\""]
["14:59,700","15:05,300","\"sucks I'm so mad like it's what this is yeah like linear stuff now it's one\""]
["15:05,300","15:09,100","\"huge yeah and I'm gonna die because I can't fucking move off this thing obviously\""]
["15:09,100","15:15,180","\"I can't possibly know what the rest of the games look but I feel like I can take a good guess revive me Kamala\""]

["15:50,820","15:58,540","\"Yet also how do people want to play this alone like solo. This does not look fun solo. Can you do this from the beginning?\""]
["15:58,540","16:02,460","\"Like the multiplayer aspect or do you have to get this far into story?\""]
["16:02,460","16:05,300","\"I think you have to get this far, but I got it right\""]
["16:05,300","16:11,780","\"Like I guess the ideas before they let people in multiplayer they want them to get like sort of the intro\""]
["16:11,780","16:21,800","\"And no one ever shoots me when I'm mid-air so even if I'm just cheesing this will definitely work I say go for it I\""]
