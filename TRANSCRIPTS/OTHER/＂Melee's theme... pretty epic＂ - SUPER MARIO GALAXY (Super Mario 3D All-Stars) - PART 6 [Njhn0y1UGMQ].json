["01:05,920","01:08,680","\"- Well, definitely the Mario one came first.\""]
["01:08,680","01:12,040","\"- Yeah, I always feel like the Melee song was based off of it.\""]

["01:13,400","01:16,440","\"I totally didn't put that together.\""]

["01:33,320","01:34,320","\"That game had real good.\""]

["03:14,600","03:20,880","\"body. Stupidest thing I've done to my own body. I mean I have a tribal tattoo. I was\""]
["03:20,880","03:27,640","\"expecting you to say it. I saw it off my soul with a knife one time. Just cause soul.\""]
["03:27,640","03:35,080","\"I feel like that would be the easy joke to make. I'm now imagining someone actually\""]
["03:35,080","03:40,720","\"like hacksawing off just like a bread slice of the bottom of their foot. Did you really?\""]
["03:40,720","03:46,320","\"Yeah, I used to steak knife. Why cuz I had a big callus on my foot and I just kind of just\""]
["03:46,320","03:53,600","\"Then it didn't hurt it. No, it didn't hurt. Oh, okay, so it was that much of a callus, huh?\""]
["03:53,600","03:56,360","\"I uh when I was in middle school one time\""]
["03:56,360","04:04,160","\"I got like a big zit and I I made the decision that it was so fucking like gross that I'd be better off\""]
["04:04,160","04:06,260","\"Just like cutting it off and having like a big\""]
["04:09,240","04:13,120","\"Yeah, it was like a big one too. So it was like I\""]
["04:13,120","04:18,140","\"Don't know surgery on yourself. Yeah, I don't know if it was like a\""]
["04:18,140","04:22,760","\"Lesser of two evils, but it definitely like looked weird. Yeah\""]
["04:22,760","04:28,800","\"That's cool. I'm proud of you. Thanks, man. You tried something new and you stuck with it\""]
["04:28,800","04:31,040","\"Yeah\""]
["04:31,040","04:33,040","\"Let's go\""]
["04:33,040","04:34,920","\"That's so cool\""]
["04:36,920","04:40,660","\"My god into the cold boy he goes. Oh no, he's alright\""]
["04:40,660","04:49,700","\"You colossal bitch something else caught him in its gravity. That's kind of a weird Mario boss where Mario's just basically beats his ass\""]
["04:49,700","04:51,080","\"Yeah\""]
["04:51,080","04:55,800","\"It's not enough to like knock him into a shell and then knock him again while he can't fight back\""]
["04:55,800","04:58,560","\"But then you got to knock him a third time for good measure\""]
["04:58,560","05:02,000","\"That is a stupid asshole\""]
["05:02,000","05:05,180","\"He didn't look like he was like on his last thread of life\""]
["05:05,180","05:10,360","\"Could just walk forward and grab Mario bit is that yeah kind of like Yoda when he abandoned all the Jedi\""]
["05:10,360","05:12,660","\"Yeah, he's a real piece of shit for doing that\""]
["05:12,660","05:16,700","\"You got a grand star\""]
["05:16,700","05:19,700","\"You know what I walks in\""]
["05:19,700","05:25,540","\"You want to be so wise we said that\""]
["05:28,580","05:32,740","\"I thought it made his character better is if he was totally non-verbal and he just went\""]
["05:32,740","05:40,460","\"You just save that grand star and then thrust it into an internally burning Sun. Yeah, well it deserved it\""]
["05:40,460","05:44,260","\"Yeah, your science lingo will only get you so far tober. I\""]
["05:44,260","05:51,300","\"Think you just unlocked a new act like a astrodome Mario 17 years old now\""]
["05:51,300","05:54,940","\"Like I am almost legal\""]
["05:55,620","06:00,200","\"Hi, consign him. Mario is definitely more than 70 years old. Wait a minute\""]
["06:00,200","06:04,160","\"I think my motto said that Mario is like 23 or something\""]
["06:04,160","06:10,300","\"You're talking in terms of like the characters actually age. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, not the history of Mario\""]
["06:10,300","06:12,300","\"Yeah, no, he's definitely he's in his 20s\""]
["06:12,300","06:18,740","\"I always thought he was not as 30s. I thought he was like an older dude. I thought he was oh I thought you were sick\""]
["06:18,740","06:24,420","\"You know, he's definitely not 17. That's all I'm trying to say like he's definitely at least at his 20s. I\""]
["06:25,020","06:27,020","\"I always felt like he was like 32.\""]
["06:27,020","06:28,020","\"Yeah, Mark.\""]
["06:28,020","06:30,020","\"Miyamoto City was like 22.\""]
["06:30,020","06:31,020","\"Yeah, we're almost at 3 or 13.\""]
["06:31,020","06:32,020","\"Yeah, we're almost at 3 or 13.\""]
["06:32,020","06:35,020","\"He was kind of a weird look for 22, but not really in the 70s.\""]
["06:35,020","06:36,020","\"Good point.\""]
["06:36,020","06:39,020","\"Which is like when Miyamoto was conceiving him.\""]
["06:39,020","06:41,020","\"Yeah, I guess that's true.\""]
["06:41,020","06:44,020","\"I always did put him like, like dad age.\""]
["06:44,020","06:45,020","\"He's kind of doughy too.\""]
["06:45,020","06:48,020","\"I feel like it would be like after his metabolism slowed down.\""]
["06:48,020","06:52,020","\"I see him as like a portly like 5'3\"\" dude, you know what I'm talking about?\""]
["06:52,020","06:53,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:53,020","06:54,020","\"Oh no.\""]
["06:54,020","07:00,460","\"this fucking guy. So important. He's got a lot to say to you. No, I'm not gonna\""]
["07:00,460","07:06,820","\"listen. Well, that's good because he's just gonna fill your head with lies. He\""]
["07:06,820","07:12,020","\"put fossils in the ground to confuse you. I can't believe this is being emulated.\""]
["07:12,020","07:16,860","\"This one works pretty good. Sunshine's a little bit weird. Like you definitely\""]
["07:16,860","07:21,020","\"are aware that you're playing an emulator sometimes without one. Really? Yeah, it's\""]
["07:21,020","07:23,620","\"It's not bad, but it's noticeable.\""]
["07:23,620","07:25,260","\"- Like what kind of things?\""]
["07:25,260","07:29,300","\"- Just like frame rate stuff where it'll blatantly tank\""]
["07:29,300","07:33,540","\"or when it goes into one of the pre-rendered cutscenes\""]
["07:33,540","07:35,040","\"that looks really weird.\""]
["07:35,040","07:39,060","\"Like I don't know, if we played it,\""]
["07:39,060","07:41,100","\"you'd definitely see what I was talking about.\""]
["07:41,100","07:42,020","\"- I like you.\""]
["07:42,020","07:46,540","\"- And I wish they'd taken a more traditional remake approach\""]
["07:46,540","07:48,340","\"and just taken their source code,\""]
["07:48,340","07:56,560","\"I'm sure was mostly C++ anyway, and just compiled it for their new thing and, you know, filled out whatever, you know,\""]
["07:56,560","07:59,560","\"Whatever the hardware abstractions shit was.\""]
["07:59,560","08:05,360","\"I think that they did custom make the emulator like it wasn't a it wasn't a deal where they like just stole\""]
["08:05,360","08:09,740","\"Dolphin and like ported it to the switch unless that's exactly what they did, but\""]
["08:09,740","08:17,100","\"It's gonna say they legally I think could actually I don't know what licensed dolphins distributed under I\""]
["08:17,620","08:19,620","\"Don't know a dolphin\""]
["08:19,620","08:23,780","\"Yeah, can you do that if someone's emulating your hardware?\""]
["08:23,780","08:29,340","\"Can you steal back that emulation and no, but I think it's open source so?\""]
["08:29,340","08:35,220","\"Certain open source licenses actually say you can reuse them like MIT license\""]
["08:35,220","08:40,980","\"Says you can legally reuse even for under commercial use without any attribution\""]
["08:40,980","08:45,700","\"Which is that's one of the most like lenient generous licenses, but even like the\""]
["08:46,220","08:53,580","\"GNU license. That's more like if you include it for free, then you have to include the source with your product\""]
["08:53,580","08:57,820","\"And you do have to credit the creator, but you can still use it in commercial stuff\""]
["08:57,820","09:02,540","\"I forget what game it was, but there was some game where they did like a remake of it\""]
["09:02,540","09:06,380","\"And I don't know how they found out, but they basically found out that they like\""]
["09:06,380","09:11,900","\"Got the ISO for the original game from like an emulator site or something\""]
["09:11,900","09:14,300","\"I have heard of stuff like that\""]
["09:14,300","09:17,380","\"I think it was Nintendo, but I don't remember what game it was\""]
["09:17,380","09:22,880","\"I've been told and this story's on the internet to where\""]
["09:22,880","09:28,820","\"People say that the hc remix of kingdom hearts one is a is completely ground up remake\""]
["09:28,820","09:33,320","\"Yeah, and I completely don't buy it at all. I think it's complete fucking bullshit\""]
["09:33,320","09:39,560","\"Cuz you can't just remake it a game entirely and have it be literally exactly the same\""]
["09:39,560","09:43,200","\"But again like if these things are made in like C++\""]
["09:43,200","09:48,680","\"They don't really have to they just have to like recompile the stuff that's like they should say to the hardware\""]
["09:48,680","09:50,960","\"That's fine. They should say it though\""]
["09:50,960","09:54,280","\"It's like they're acting like it's a big feat like it had to be completely\""]
["09:54,280","10:01,760","\"Redonously, it's not I mean if they're using like new models and like but they probably aren't they're probably like but they probably did polish them up and stuff, right?\""]
["10:01,760","10:03,760","\"Oh, maybe I don't know\""]
["10:03,760","10:09,320","\"There's still definitely way more effort that goes into even that kind of remake than just you know\""]
["10:09,320","10:13,520","\"It just feels like fake trivia creating like a middleware emulator kind of thing\""]
["10:13,520","10:21,640","\"On IMDB on the hobbits, you know the desolation of smog whatever in the trivia for that movie. They're like it took computers\""]
["10:21,640","10:27,000","\"72 hours to render one scale of smog's armor. It's like a complete fucking horseshoe\""]
["10:27,000","10:29,360","\"fucking line\""]
["10:29,360","10:31,720","\"72 hours is you complete fucking liars?\""]
["10:31,720","10:38,200","\"Yeah, like there was something where they're like they made every individual grain of sand for the sandman and spider-man\""]
["10:38,200","10:39,420","\"I'm like, no they didn't.\""]
["10:39,420","10:40,260","\"Oh here we go.\""]
["10:40,260","10:41,620","\"Yeah no, this was a particle system.\""]
["10:41,620","10:42,460","\"It's worse.\""]
["10:42,460","10:45,080","\"It says, \"\"It took one processor week\""]
["10:45,080","10:47,940","\"to render a scale from Smog's body.\"\"\""]
["10:47,940","10:49,840","\"It's not fucking true at all.\""]
["10:49,840","10:50,840","\"What is a processor week though?\""]
["10:50,840","10:52,720","\"There's saying it took one processor.\""]
["10:52,720","10:54,460","\"I bet you they just told them how many\""]
["10:54,460","10:56,880","\"like CUDA cores were in the system.\""]
["10:56,880","10:59,120","\"And then they tried dividing the time by the--\""]
["10:59,120","11:00,880","\"But even still it's not true.\""]
["11:00,880","11:04,520","\"One Nvidia chip would have like thousands of CUDA cores now.\""]
["11:04,520","11:06,480","\"So I don't, I think it's like a really,\""]
["11:06,480","11:09,640","\"It's probably a really inaccurate abstraction.\""]
["11:09,640","11:10,480","\"- Probably.\""]
["11:10,480","11:11,320","\"- All I'm saying is--\""]
["11:11,320","11:13,040","\"- Or just, not inaccurate but misleading.\""]
["11:13,040","11:14,880","\"- It's just a stupid piece of trivia.\""]
["11:14,880","11:15,720","\"- Yeah.\""]
["11:15,720","11:17,120","\"- That's like that shit you were talking about earlier\""]
["11:17,120","11:18,840","\"with the serving size.\""]
["11:18,840","11:20,920","\"- What's your serving size, trivia?\""]
["11:20,920","11:21,760","\"Well, it's not trivia.\""]
["11:21,760","11:22,920","\"- I'm just talking about how it's kind of an,\""]
["11:22,920","11:26,080","\"I wish that things where the servings aren't\""]
["11:26,080","11:27,520","\"an obvious thing.\""]
["11:27,520","11:29,760","\"When it's something like a bag of chips,\""]
["11:29,760","11:32,720","\"and it's like, oh, it's only 120 calories per serving.\""]
["11:32,720","11:34,520","\"By the way, there's six servings in here.\""]
["11:34,520","11:38,620","\"like four chips like I don't think they should be allowed to do that\""]
["11:38,620","11:43,980","\"I think they should just have to say everything in the bag and not be able to do the per serving thing\""]
["11:43,980","11:48,980","\"Yeah, because it's blatantly someone's just gonna eat the whole bag of that even though it's easy math to do\""]
