["00:03,600","00:07,900","\"Uh, I think we should see Rory first, since that's more important.\""]
["00:07,900","00:09,400","\"She's dude.\""]

["00:15,400","00:17,400","\"He gets shit on so constantly.\""]
["00:17,400","00:20,900","\"I mean, to be fair, he's also an asshole every single time too.\""]
["00:20,900","00:21,900","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["00:21,900","00:22,900","\"Well, what do we do?\""]
["00:22,900","00:24,900","\"Should we go focus on story?\""]
["00:24,900","00:26,900","\"Or should we go see Rory?\""]
["00:26,900","00:28,900","\"Focus on the story, but also go see Rory.\""]
["00:28,900","00:29,900","\"Okay.\""]
["00:29,900","00:31,900","\"Rory!\""]
["00:31,900","00:34,180","\"Get out of here! Come here!\""]
["00:34,180","00:40,340","\"That'll enhance me, I don't know why! I need a friend right now!\""]
["00:40,340","00:49,420","\"It's something to do with me bothering her and telling her to quit. I don't get it. Why isn't he answering? Nothing happened, I think.\""]
["00:49,420","00:56,380","\"Oh, hi. Are you Rory's friends? Oh my god. Why don't you come inside?\""]
["00:56,380","00:58,380","\"Oh my god, who's this beautiful bag?\""]
["00:58,380","01:02,380","\"You sure don't want to come in and have something to eat?\""]
["01:02,380","01:04,380","\"We've done the long mom\""]
["01:04,380","01:06,380","\"That's his mom?\""]
["01:06,380","01:08,380","\"Your mom is all legs\""]
["01:08,380","01:10,380","\"You can't say that\""]
["01:10,380","01:11,380","\"Shut up\""]
["01:11,380","01:12,380","\"What?\""]
["01:12,380","01:15,380","\"She's literally a leg\""]
["01:15,380","01:16,380","\"Really?\""]
["01:16,380","01:17,380","\"I guess so\""]
["01:17,380","01:19,380","\"Okay\""]
["01:19,380","01:22,380","\"That's not a good joke\""]

["01:23,380","01:25,380","\"She's literally a leg\""]
["01:25,380","01:28,180","\"What? What's happening?\""]
["01:28,180","01:30,580","\"That's the same boys clip of him saying shut up.\""]
["01:30,580","01:33,380","\"Why don't I need more information on Sammy?\""]
["01:33,380","01:35,380","\"Sammy. I mean Sammy.\""]
["01:35,380","01:38,180","\"Alex has something he wants to say to you.\""]
["01:38,180","01:48,380","\"I say refuse.\""]
["01:48,380","01:50,780","\"Stay in character.\""]
["01:50,780","01:54,180","\"I like that he's looking around too.\""]
["01:54,180","01:56,180","\"You better not make that up\""]
["01:56,180","02:05,140","\"Please refuse please I don't think Alex would apologize. Yeah, it wouldn't be it's not in this character\""]
["02:05,140","02:08,060","\"Not in this character\""]
["02:08,060","02:18,080","\"Beautiful Michael coming in saying to he has something to tell you\""]
["02:18,080","02:22,140","\"Fuck you\""]
["02:22,140","02:29,660","\"in danger all day Jesus I don't want to make a big deal out of it but seriously\""]
["02:29,660","02:38,080","\"come on yeah you're right what I'm sorry I'm a piece of shit I don't know what\""]
["02:38,080","02:44,780","\"I was thinking I thank you see you made the right decision after all Alex what\""]
["02:44,780","02:51,020","\"the hell why did you make such a good decision I couldn't have come up with\""]
["02:51,020","03:01,140","\"that so we're trying to just ignores him you want to come with us no you're mean\""]
["03:01,140","03:09,260","\"oh you any beer and you see we're friends again he's in my party that's all you need\""]
["03:09,260","03:17,820","\"it's so beautiful the jittering the slow down the frame drops no it is beautiful\""]
["03:17,820","03:18,820","\"It's just a switch.\""]
["03:18,820","03:23,980","\"That's the thing is the shadows, I don't remember being in the original switch release.\""]
["03:23,980","03:28,660","\"I think with them added in now, things have been running even slower.\""]
["03:28,660","03:29,660","\"Is it really that?\""]
["03:29,660","03:32,100","\"Dig of a deal graphically.\""]
["03:32,100","03:35,940","\"It didn't mess up the in yes, shadows can be.\""]
["03:35,940","03:38,620","\"They can't actually affect performance, especially on the switch.\""]
["03:38,620","03:39,940","\"The switch isn't the best hardware.\""]
["03:39,940","03:42,140","\"So why not just texture the shadows on them?\""]
["03:42,140","03:44,380","\"Like just bake them on everything?\""]
["03:44,380","03:45,380","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:45,380","03:46,380","\"I don't know.\""]
["03:46,380","03:47,380","\"Because games used to do that.\""]
["03:47,380","03:50,920","\"I can think of like a few Sega Saturn games that used to do that, for example.\""]
["03:50,920","03:53,180","\"Do you ever have to come out here for any specific purpose?\""]
["03:53,180","03:54,920","\"Because I don't remember their beginning.\""]
["03:54,920","03:56,120","\"You have to praise the animators.\""]
["03:56,120","03:57,880","\"Hey, do you know, Elisa Lamb?\""]
["03:57,880","03:59,360","\"Oh, right.\""]
["03:59,360","04:01,800","\"That makes sense.\""]
["04:01,800","04:02,720","\"So I'm going left now?\""]
["04:02,720","04:04,920","\"I don't know if you need to go this way.\""]
["04:04,920","04:06,720","\"I guess check the hint where you should be going.\""]
["04:06,720","04:08,800","\"Record stop.\""]
["04:08,800","04:09,800","\"Okay.\""]
["04:09,800","04:11,960","\"So we go back to the record stuff that we were just in.\""]
["04:11,960","04:12,960","\"That you were just in.\""]
["04:12,960","04:13,460","\"Okay.\""]
["04:13,460","04:13,720","\"Let's see.\""]
["04:13,720","04:14,640","\"What was it with you?\""]
["04:14,640","04:16,080","\"So the guy didn't want to tell you anything.\""]
["04:16,080","04:16,780","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:16,780","04:18,040","\"I went to the bathroom.\""]
["04:18,040","04:18,840","\"What did I miss?\""]
["04:18,840","04:22,840","\"Uh, we went back to Vella just for nothing to happen.\""]
["04:22,840","04:24,820","\"For the game told us, well, we got the Windy town.\""]
["04:24,820","04:26,620","\"The game said, Oh, you got to speak to Vella.\""]
["04:26,620","04:27,180","\"It's like, cool.\""]
["04:27,180","04:27,580","\"Thank you.\""]
["04:27,580","04:28,380","\"So we went back.\""]
["04:28,380","04:31,780","\"Then she didn't come with us anyway, because he pissed her off.\""]
["04:31,780","04:34,060","\"Cause yeah, he was being himself.\""]
["04:34,060","04:38,620","\"Then Michael happened to just be there and he came with us.\""]
["04:38,620","04:42,180","\"And then we were going to go to the record story and said, can't you go talk to Rory?\""]
["04:42,180","04:42,900","\"And we did.\""]
["04:42,900","04:46,340","\"And we called him an asshole because that is what Alex would do.\""]
["04:46,340","04:49,620","\"Alex doesn't apologize.\""]
["04:49,620","04:52,580","\"Okay, let's talk to the man.\""]
["04:52,580","04:53,580","\"Hello.\""]
["04:53,580","04:55,460","\"Hey, we're looking for this record.\""]
["04:55,460","04:59,380","\"It's called Mystical Ultimate LP Legend.\""]
["04:59,380","05:02,300","\"I've got the record jacket, but not the record.\""]
["05:02,300","05:04,900","\"Any idea if it's in stock?\""]
["05:04,900","05:06,820","\"Is that Michael and Rory?\""]
["05:06,820","05:08,500","\"Now I'll talk to you.\""]
["05:08,500","05:10,740","\"How are you guys doing?\""]
["05:10,740","05:14,100","\"I must feel really shitty too.\""]
["05:14,100","05:19,140","\"could get a job very easily, but not Alex. He's got nothing going for him.\""]
["05:19,140","05:20,740","\"People see the beard and they run.\""]
["05:20,740","05:25,300","\"I'm glad I've been noticing villain characters popping up that look exactly like Alex.\""]
["05:25,300","05:28,740","\"I know you like the villain from no stream roads.\""]
["05:28,740","05:34,580","\"It is kind of like a warning sign when you see somebody like that.\""]
["05:34,580","05:35,540","\"Villains?\""]
["05:35,540","05:37,140","\"Just the attitude and everything.\""]
["05:37,140","05:41,860","\"Someone like Alex, if you ran into him, I don't think your first impression would be,\""]
["05:41,860","05:47,860","\"That's a trustworthy guy. I think you'd have some pretty negative feelings about him after one interaction.\""]
["05:47,860","05:49,700","\"\"\"Does it have to be on vinyl?\"\"\""]
["05:49,700","05:50,180","\"\"\"You're-\"\"\""]
["05:50,180","05:54,260","\"\"\"I don't really care. I suppose I'd prefer to be more of an authentic sound, you know?\"\"\""]
["05:54,260","05:57,060","\"\"\"Yeah, but only if you're playing from a tube amp.\"\"\""]
["05:57,060","05:58,980","\"\"\"You have a tube amp, right?\"\"\""]
["05:58,980","06:01,220","\"\"\"Is that correct, Chris? Do you know enough about audio?\"\"\""]
["06:01,220","06:02,820","\"\"\"This is people, uh...\"\"\""]
["06:02,820","06:08,340","\"\"\"You know, audio files will always be like, 'Oh, you need the saturation from a tube amp.'\""]
["06:09,060","06:13,820","\"Hearing has to song dude you get it. I like you now\""]
["06:13,820","06:17,120","\"Let me thumb you for a second\""]
["06:17,120","06:25,140","\"Yeah\""]
["06:25,140","06:31,700","\"But we have two sister stores that probably will Jesus Christ you knew it was coming Chris\""]
["06:31,700","06:37,060","\"Hey, wait, could you maybe pick up a phone and call them and ask them with a L. Whatever they didn't have phones in\""]
["06:37,300","06:44,300","\"1999 it's a good point. He could have called ahead. We'll check it out. I remember doing it all the time when I was younger at like Blockbuster\""]
["06:44,300","06:49,160","\"There's a strip mall east of here. That's the closest one. It's a world map\""]
["06:49,160","06:53,220","\"It's our flagship store. So I tell you'll miss it. Good luck guys\""]
["06:53,220","06:57,780","\"So now we're going where oh\""]
["06:57,780","07:05,500","\"Oh, I just did that. I'm pretty sure that's what just happened. That's what you guys are\""]
["07:05,500","07:08,000","\"(laughter)\""]
["07:08,000","07:11,140","\"- Well now that you're outside and this cutscene is played,\""]
["07:11,140","07:12,500","\"maybe it'll tell you what to do.\""]
["07:12,500","07:13,460","\"- Are you in two stores?\""]
["07:13,460","07:14,620","\"Yeah I guess.\""]
["07:14,620","07:15,740","\"Sounds like it could be fun.\""]
["07:15,740","07:17,220","\"- Why does he not want to go?\""]
["07:17,220","07:19,060","\"- No!\""]
["07:19,060","07:20,780","\"- I am down, let's do this.\""]
["07:20,780","07:21,940","\"- Why does he look like that?\""]
["07:21,940","07:23,620","\"- I don't know.\""]
["07:23,620","07:24,860","\"- Easy there, tiger.\""]
["07:24,860","07:29,620","\"- Okay, so the guy in the lap's going.\""]
["07:29,620","07:30,460","\"The guy in the lap's going,\""]
["07:30,460","07:32,960","\"(yells)\""]
["07:32,960","07:35,800","\"Everybody has very intense emotions on this game.\""]
["07:35,800","07:37,160","\"They sure do.\""]
["07:37,160","07:38,360","\"Let's buy shit.\""]
["07:38,360","07:39,760","\"Maybe save.\""]
["07:39,760","07:40,320","\"No.\""]
["07:40,320","07:40,960","\"Before you leave.\""]
["07:40,960","07:42,520","\"Don't talk to me ever again.\""]
["07:42,520","07:44,760","\"I love eating fucking junk food.\""]
["07:44,760","07:47,160","\"You can feed Rory at least three cheeseburgers.\""]
["07:47,160","07:49,160","\"He'll probably like you more as a friend.\""]
["07:49,160","07:50,960","\"He'll become more of an American citizen.\""]
["07:50,960","07:52,560","\"Jewish it was like Pokemon.\""]
["07:52,560","07:55,960","\"Yeah, you feed him cupcakes that you made for him.\""]
["07:55,960","07:56,960","\"You pat him on the head.\""]
["07:56,960","07:57,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:57,960","08:02,760","\"You just rub your hand in a circular motion on his forehead.\""]
["08:02,760","08:04,760","\"and he got any matey smiles.\""]
["08:04,760","08:07,760","\"That's her. You're gonna have to win back Vella at the arcade.\""]
["08:07,760","08:09,760","\"You just start rubbing her head.\""]
["08:09,760","08:11,760","\"Throwing cupcakes at her.\""]
["08:11,760","08:14,760","\"We gotta go to the strip mall via the bus stop in the middle of nowhere.\""]
["08:14,760","08:17,760","\"Okay, where's the middle of nowhere? Me no no.\""]
["08:17,760","08:18,760","\"That's where courage lives.\""]
["08:18,760","08:19,760","\"Let's go over here.\""]
["08:19,760","08:21,760","\"199 bottles of beer on the wall.\""]
["08:21,760","08:23,760","\"You know what? It's 1999.\""]
["08:23,760","08:27,760","\"Why doesn't Alex have fond memories of Cartoon Network?\""]
["08:27,760","08:29,760","\"Because it's happening right now.\""]
["08:29,760","08:30,760","\"right now.\""]
["08:30,760","08:34,100","\"Because he's in a video game so you can't reference anything but video games.\""]
["08:34,100","08:35,100","\"I love my little-\""]
["08:35,100","08:37,940","\"Except he'd age me Ninja Turtles, which was an A.D. thing.\""]
["08:37,940","08:40,740","\"Yeah, we did it.\""]
["08:40,740","08:41,740","\"Okay.\""]
["08:41,740","08:45,940","\"You know, something a little bit weird about having a tip that says video games are not\""]
["08:45,940","08:49,380","\"a waste of time when literally right now the game is wasting your time.\""]
["08:49,380","08:55,460","\"It's really sad because I enjoy most of the game besides that.\""]
["08:55,460","08:59,340","\"No, there was a lot going on prior to this the pace was being kept up\""]
["08:59,340","09:07,400","\"So Rory tell us more about you. I don't think we know all that much. My hair is yellow and so are my pants\""]
["09:07,400","09:15,720","\"Yeah, but we knew that also seen some way down\""]
["09:15,720","09:18,980","\"scene was not a thing back then\""]
["09:18,980","09:23,560","\"Wasn't that a 2000's exactly yes. That's the way he's dressed. That's it\""]
["09:23,560","09:26,920","\"Wow! Dark dude.\""]
["09:26,920","09:28,280","\"I didn't know that about you.\""]
["09:28,280","09:31,320","\"Like have a job or any hobbies?\""]
["09:31,320","09:35,400","\"Yeah, I work at the shitty video store, planet VHS.\""]
["09:35,400","09:37,400","\"We can get you any VHS.\""]
["09:37,400","09:41,040","\"Well, once after its continental US release on VHS,\""]
["09:41,040","09:43,680","\"So basically, we suck.\""]
["09:43,680","09:46,120","\"I don't really know if college is in the cards for me.\""]
["09:46,120","09:47,120","\"Why do you say that?\""]
["09:47,120","09:48,680","\"Colleges for everyone.\""]
["09:48,680","09:50,680","\"I can give you lots of college advice.\""]
["09:50,680","09:53,160","\"My parents aren't believing cells.\""]
["09:53,160","09:55,160","\"Also my mom's a leg\""]
["09:55,160","09:57,680","\"Yeah, what was that?\""]
["09:57,680","10:06,280","\"Do you remember his mother being a leg Julian I did I was hinting at it before was that really even an NPC that mentions that she's a leg at\""]
["10:06,280","10:08,280","\"One point they hint at it\""]
["10:08,280","10:11,620","\"Well it so canonically she is just a leg if the characters\""]
["10:11,620","10:16,320","\"Look if the characters supposed to be dark and like fucked up don't make their mom a leg\""]
["10:16,320","10:22,480","\"That's pretty much the number one rule and right you'd probably be depressed too if your mom was a leg not a person true\""]
["10:22,480","10:26,480","\"I don't know if that's true. I feel like I have responsibility to them.\""]
["10:26,480","10:28,480","\"My mom can't get out of bed on her own.\""]
["10:28,480","10:30,480","\"She's a leg.\""]
["10:30,480","10:34,480","\"I would be really just happy when she hops from place to place.\""]
["10:34,480","10:38,480","\"I would be so happy if there was like a sad chapter dedicated to the fact that she's just a leg.\""]
