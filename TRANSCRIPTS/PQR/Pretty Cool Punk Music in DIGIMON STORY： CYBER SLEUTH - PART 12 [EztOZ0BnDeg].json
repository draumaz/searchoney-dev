["02:34,120","02:34,960","\"- Yeah.\""]
["02:34,960","02:36,400","\"- I think that would fall under pop punk.\""]
["02:36,400","02:37,680","\"- Yeah.\""]
["02:37,680","02:40,560","\"So let me try to decipher why I hate certain punk\""]
["02:40,560","02:42,120","\"and not that one.\""]
["02:42,120","02:44,560","\"Maybe it's hypocrisy.\""]

["03:10,120","03:13,120","\"It's the prequel to some 41\""]
["03:13,120","03:18,320","\"There's something different about like how they do it. I'm trying to put my finger on it\""]
["03:18,320","03:22,680","\"It's definitely when one has vocal sound like less annoying because it sounds more cool\""]
["03:22,680","03:25,560","\"Can you feel that the other guys like\""]
["03:25,560","03:29,600","\"That's more like a metal sort of thing isn't it?\""]
["03:29,600","03:41,440","\"Sort of declarative voice so you can't get behind that punk movement, huh?\""]
["03:41,440","03:47,600","\"Do their Mohawks intimidate you I wouldn't afraid that they might poke you in the eye\""]
["03:47,600","03:49,560","\"I think they're aesthetic is kind of cool\""]
["03:49,560","03:54,520","\"I feel like a let's plays are like the opposite of punk. Yeah, so it makes sense\""]
["03:54,520","03:58,640","\"Something really deeply flawed about let's plays as a concept\""]
["03:58,640","04:01,040","\"Right mm-hmm\""]
["04:01,040","04:06,800","\"Can you write me a punk song about let's plays? No, I can't write lyrics. I bet somebody has do you remember the punk\""]

["04:27,720","04:29,220","\"No, it wasn't that early.\""]
["04:29,220","04:31,120","\"I thought it was ahead of \"\"Disgae\"\" a reference\""]
["04:31,120","04:32,280","\"and other things.\""]
["04:32,280","04:34,560","\"Yeah, let me look it up. I'm curious.\""]
