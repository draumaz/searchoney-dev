["02:38,420","02:42,900","\"Let's talk about the movie because you guys you were talking about Jiminy cricket. He was fucking terrible\""]
["02:42,900","02:49,700","\"He's a good actor generally. Yeah, but he's like delivery was like somebody said he sounded like the Jiminy cricket from the fucking Kingdom Hearts game\""]
["02:49,700","02:55,840","\"Joseph Gordon Levitt is a talented actor, but yeah that his Jiminy cricket is the most great\""]
["02:55,840","03:03,440","\"It's like someone trying to do a grading high-pitched cartoon voice. Yeah, but fucking Tom Hanks sounds like he's talking to false teeth\""]
["03:03,440","03:11,500","\"Acting as horrendous I can't even understand I could do a better Japato than him you do do it Chris\""]
["03:11,500","03:13,900","\"Maybe Tom\""]
["03:15,900","03:22,220","\"I heard that the guy who played Jepato in the original Pinocchio was like a Nazi or something. Yeah, they couldn't keep the same guy\""]

["03:24,860","03:30,780","\"He was like I get to be in the new Pinocchio by the way, I love Adolph Hitler\""]
["03:30,780","03:35,720","\"Isn't that real that was a real thing maybe I don't remember\""]
["03:35,720","03:41,160","\"sued by the state of sounds made up it sounds like a deep fake\""]
["03:42,140","03:48,900","\"Okay, why are you running into him early on shouldn't he be a pleasure island you fucking lamp. That's not lamp. That's lamp. Wix cousin\""]
["03:48,900","03:53,620","\"That looks just like you lamp. We're just lamp. We're a little shampoo. Can I go up this pipe? Oh?\""]

["04:22,660","04:25,060","\"I just wanna talk about how fucking horrible\""]
["04:25,060","04:26,780","\"Pleasure Island scene was.\""]
["04:26,780","04:29,180","\"The whole fucking point of Pleasure Island\""]
["04:29,180","04:32,460","\"was the fact that Pinocchio was a shitty little kid.\""]
["04:32,460","04:34,140","\"'Cause he didn't have a fucking conscience.\""]
["04:34,140","04:34,980","\"- They messed it up.\""]
["04:34,980","04:39,380","\"He's like he just like lands in the in the car on its way to drylin\""]

["04:45,980","04:52,660","\"Should I be smashing windows and it's like you were fucking doing that in the cartoon in what was it the 80s that fucking movie?\""]
["04:52,660","05:01,460","\"Or 40s, or whatever we were fucking smashing windows and smoking cigars and now you're just drinking root beer and thinking you're a bad kid\""]
["05:01,460","05:07,020","\"But the whole point of Jim and he crickety to be your fucking conscience. You're not supposed to have a fucking conscience\""]
["05:07,020","05:11,900","\"Conscience be a guy. No that absolutely stood out to me. Yeah, that made me\""]
["05:11,900","05:20,640","\"1940 okay 1940 I grew up with Pinocchio was the only Disney movie that like we physically owned the rest were like\""]
["05:20,640","05:28,320","\"You know burned unlike fucking BHSes, but like Pinocchio was the movie we had I remember it was those thick little plastic ones\""]
["05:28,320","05:30,320","\"That came out in the 90s when they first started selling them\""]
["05:31,060","05:37,540","\"Um, and I watch Pinocchio so much so I remember it and so many of this movie. It's just like it's a fucking disaster\""]
