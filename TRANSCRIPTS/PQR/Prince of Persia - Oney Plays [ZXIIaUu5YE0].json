["00:57,220","01:01,340","\"Is this what happened in the movie where he froze for a few seconds while the book attacked?\""]
["01:01,340","01:03,340","\"I think it's like this kind of attorney\""]
["01:03,340","01:09,940","\"This genuine copy of the game is working that well no\""]

["01:16,340","01:24,100","\"Outside as the trades must be moving. Yeah, we're on the hogwash express. That's a really real real reflection\""]
["01:25,100","01:28,840","\"Yeah, we can't play this. This is broken. Maybe we should put on something else on the GameCube\""]
["01:28,840","01:37,120","\"With friends you be soft you be soft challenge everything\""]
["01:37,120","01:42,000","\"Ubisoft\""]

["01:45,540","01:52,840","\"They actually did they made 16,000 of these they did three of them and then they did that one that was a remote a remote a reboot\""]
["01:52,840","02:02,440","\"Yes, you've got me. They did the reboot one with Nolan North and where he is always talking and then nobody likes that one\""]
["02:02,440","02:06,220","\"Wait Nolan North always talking in a video. Yeah, he always talked\""]
["02:06,220","02:08,140","\"Someone told him that it was a bad idea\""]
["02:08,140","02:09,400","\"Actually, it wasn't that bad of a game\""]
["02:09,400","02:13,640","\"But it didn't get as good of a response as this one and then they brought back sands of time\""]
["02:13,640","02:19,200","\"I don't remember if it was like a reboot or if it was it's supposed to happen in the middle of a couple games or something\""]
["02:19,200","02:22,240","\"Yeah, but that came out and I didn't hear anything about it\""]
["02:22,440","02:28,640","\"Prince of Parvo the sands of infected gums. This is the first shot and I get to control him in the first shot\""]
["02:28,640","02:33,800","\"This is based off of the Atari original. What the fuck this game from 2003 has cloth physics? Yes\""]
["02:33,800","02:36,640","\"And now it never will again\""]
["02:36,640","02:39,560","\"This game will never have that shot ever again\""]
["02:39,560","02:48,180","\"You've walked out on your one opportunity to see that shot and that's the game crying if I had one opportunity it for one shot\""]
["02:48,920","02:53,340","\"It would be underneath the girls dressed or under her breast\""]
["02:53,340","02:57,680","\"All right, thank God it reset. See you do get it would do the cloth physics again\""]

["03:37,480","03:40,480","\"Someone should tell me to put more emphasis on enduring a war.\""]
["03:40,480","03:42,480","\"I can't believe this is how it starts off.\""]
["03:42,480","03:45,480","\"I thought I'd be like in a tomb learning how to run along walls and shit.\""]
["03:45,480","03:46,160","\"No.\""]
["03:46,160","03:48,680","\"Marry me, I'm here in an open area having to learn how to run.\""]

["05:37,600","05:42,940","\"So we wanted to hear the screams and shouts of the people dying. Oh, I can use ladders like in real life\""]
["05:42,940","05:47,040","\"Oh\""]
["05:47,040","05:53,340","\"That was awesome. Look at that. Oh, they didn't fuck you. It hit me. There's severe like a blood when you're getting sliced at\""]
["05:53,340","05:55,580","\"The second one has blood\""]
["05:55,580","05:59,020","\"Actually, this has little splatters, but the second and third one\""]
["05:59,020","06:02,260","\"They they I think God of War came out and got really popular\""]
["06:02,260","06:04,040","\"Yeah, and they were like oh shit\""]
["06:04,040","06:09,640","\"We got to put a bunch of blood in it so the second third one have like decapitations and stuff. I'm happy with that\""]
["06:09,640","06:11,400","\"No wonder this was on the GameCube\""]
["06:11,400","06:15,600","\"There should be a scene though where you like gnaw off their arm and vivid detail with\""]
["06:15,600","06:18,280","\"insanely well done sound effects\""]
["06:18,280","06:21,040","\"man when I was a kid I\""]

["06:33,820","06:40,380","\"He just did it and then uh the first the first scene that happens is you like kill a bunch of dudes on a boat\""]
["06:40,380","06:42,380","\"And you see titties\""]
["06:42,380","06:47,020","\"My mom walked in right then she's like how dare you play this and she that sucks\""]
["06:47,020","06:50,300","\"I gotta at me you should just say shut up mom show me your titties\""]

["06:58,220","07:01,940","\"For real one of these fucking redundant enemies\""]
["07:01,940","07:07,780","\"I always wish like if you're gonna introduce an enemy like this give them like a kind of generic outfit\""]
["07:07,780","07:10,660","\"Like look at these guys. They're like copied and paste\""]
["07:10,660","07:16,260","\"I wish they would have just been like all like one color with like weapon variants because then you feel like you're playing like\""]
["07:16,260","07:18,900","\"What is that you feel like you're playing?\""]
["07:18,900","07:22,500","\"Charlie's Angels for GameCube, but it's just like redundancy. Oh\""]
["07:22,500","07:24,500","\"Oh, surely not look at him go\""]
["07:24,500","07:33,820","\"That his head goes flying off I wish his head fucking came off there we could actually play the second one if you prefer that\""]
["07:33,820","07:38,660","\"No, no, I'm joking. It's I like the junk, but it's actually doesn't look too bad\""]
["07:38,660","07:42,220","\"Yeah, I think the consensus though is that this one is the best one\""]
["07:42,220","07:46,180","\"I never played this one. I think I played the second one back in the day people were obsessed with this\""]
["07:46,180","07:51,420","\"They were like this is the greatest game ever. Yeah, I know I played this at a friend's house\""]
["07:51,420","07:57,220","\"But I don't remember almost any of it. I played the one for Atari and it sucked or whatever it is clicko vision\""]
["07:57,220","08:03,420","\"I don't know like the dog one. Yeah, the one where moves in slow motion. Yeah, that's that's a completely different thing\""]
["08:03,420","08:08,100","\"I can't believe you guys aren't laughing your ass off that window. It's just oh, yeah, it looks pretty\""]

["08:12,340","08:17,340","\"Run along the wall hold\""]
["08:20,780","08:25,120","\"That's sick you can't just run over a fucking current like that your foot we had car\""]
["08:25,120","08:26,960","\"And you'd fall to your death under those pikes below\""]
["08:26,960","08:31,320","\"Yeah, that guy tried to do that same exact thing he fell\""]
["08:31,320","08:39,400","\"A bunch of babies just spray shit all over the walls\""]
["08:39,400","08:46,120","\"Yeah, it's quite a lot of shit quite a lot of feaches\""]
["08:46,120","08:50,600","\"You know that when you don't never give up until they make it across that wall\""]
["08:50,600","08:56,420","\"That just looks fun. I love being able to do this kind of shit. I'm gonna have a little seppity dip\""]
["08:56,420","09:00,360","\"Yeah, I probably wouldn't drink water that was like walked in\""]
["09:00,360","09:06,100","\"You don't know that anyone else has been walking. It looks rather clean though. It's clearly a toilet. I mean yeah, I\""]
["09:06,100","09:11,040","\"Oh shit. Well, I mean if I just walked into a room where I saw five guys\""]
["09:11,040","09:16,500","\"I would assume one of them walked into it. Listen, man. You're in sterile feces is sterile. It's all sterile\""]
["09:16,500","09:18,900","\"You can eat whatever you want. I mean, it's Egypt\""]
["09:18,900","09:21,900","\"So it might be a little hot, so maybe it would be already like fine to drink.\""]
["09:21,900","09:27,700","\"Also, I don't know if you guys knew this, but if you don't believe in germs, they can't get you.\""]
["09:27,700","09:28,700","\"That's true.\""]
["09:28,700","09:29,700","\"Oh no.\""]
["09:29,700","09:30,700","\"Where are you going?\""]
["09:30,700","09:32,700","\"I didn't mean to do this.\""]
["09:32,700","09:34,700","\"I didn't mean to do this.\""]
["09:34,700","09:37,700","\"Wait, use your sense of time.\""]
["09:37,700","09:38,900","\"You don't have it yet.\""]
["09:38,900","09:42,700","\"Please, Corey, please let me unlock that first before you ask again.\""]
["09:42,700","09:43,700","\"Please.\""]
["09:43,700","09:48,700","\"If I hear one more word about that, spoiling the atmosphere of this wonderful day.\""]
["09:48,700","09:53,100","\"That is awesome. That's something I would do in real life honestly. Yeah, I believe it\""]
["09:53,100","09:58,820","\"Runs in the work to record any plays. Yes wait no runs in the work to recording plays\""]
["09:58,820","10:05,820","\"Runs in the work to play any plays runs off the side of the building and falls to his death again\""]
["10:05,820","10:10,500","\"Shut up. I didn't repeat the footage of Chris Baldon\""]
["10:13,220","10:15,220","\"We want to have a sip\""]
["10:15,220","10:20,860","\"Now you're out of water you've used your water goodwill for the water you're standing you're getting up during again\""]
["10:20,860","10:25,340","\"What kind of fucking mongolates dance in the water and\""]
["10:25,340","10:32,000","\"I said to be into a pool\""]
["10:32,000","10:38,540","\"Like haven't you ever watched anything you always lean over it. Oh shit. He blocked your shirt\""]
["10:40,620","10:42,620","\"Good thing you had\""]
["10:42,620","10:49,280","\"Fence Billy frames. Yeah, that's pretty sick. Ah you stabbed me right in the fucking back. Ah you sent me room up front this time\""]
["10:49,280","10:55,980","\"Love games really make the people just sink into the ground\""]
["10:55,980","11:01,400","\"No, it's historically accurate. That's what they used to do. Look at this. This is a good game\""]
["11:01,400","11:08,380","\"I think that impacts that would have shook the building made you get hurt at least a little bit\""]
["11:09,780","11:12,140","\"It's a weird click-click sound every time you get up\""]
["11:12,140","11:17,220","\"This game's just silly all over honestly. It's a gaff in a goof\""]
["11:17,220","11:26,260","\"Then you drop again, I like that one scream sound effect that it's worth repeating honestly\""]
["11:26,260","11:33,500","\"It's true. I'm not that was not sarcasm. I actually do like it. I remember there's this one scream in\""]
["11:34,740","11:40,840","\"I think it was Halo 2. I remember I was playing lock I was on lockdown or lockout or whatever\""]
["11:40,840","11:46,300","\"And I knocked it I knocked an enemy off and I had never heard the scream before and it was just like\""]
["11:46,300","11:53,580","\"It was like a weird scream and I still I've never heard it in what game and uh\""]
["11:53,580","12:01,460","\"When I was playing halo - I was playing on lockout and I someone could made me fall off the edge and I heard that scream recently\""]
["12:01,460","12:04,140","\"Yeah, no, no not recently\""]
["12:04,140","12:10,140","\"It was a while ago and then I looked when you finally unlock all the sounds like you can hear the screams of like the halo characters\""]
["12:10,140","12:12,140","\"Editor put the sound on because you can probably find it\""]
["12:12,140","12:20,380","\"It's just like most it's like a blood curdling scream or it's almost like I don't know if it's like goofy or blood curdling\""]
["12:20,380","12:23,780","\"But it was like really funny. I think if I made a character fall off\""]
["12:23,780","12:26,380","\"I would give a 0.1% chance that they would make like a\""]
["12:30,700","12:33,200","\"It's like halo whatever you could hit you're like oh\""]
["12:33,200","12:43,020","\"Okay fucking our Dark Souls. What am I saying? No no Dark Souls. Yeah when you done Dark Souls\""]
["12:43,020","12:45,380","\"So funny\""]
["12:45,380","12:48,120","\"It's the only reason to play normally you play I play a girl\""]
["12:48,120","12:52,060","\"I'm like every other game, but in Dark Souls. I always play a guy in the first one so I can hear him go oh\""]
["12:52,060","12:59,840","\"It smacked it makes it all worth it safe successful. He's just imagine things actually making like\""]
["12:59,840","13:05,380","\"Every time you got hit by an enemy it would probably be awful. Oh\""]
["13:05,380","13:08,840","\"Oh, yeah, this game he talks to himself a bunch\""]
