["04:11,520","04:19,480","\"Are you saying there's some kind of W dimension that I wasn't aware of I was thinking like strike 40 when they like spit at you and stuff\""]
["04:19,480","04:23,760","\"My fourth dimension is my spit\""]
["04:23,760","04:30,400","\"That we should incorporate that in no one he plays just flash on the screen when you should get spit on and\""]

["04:34,920","04:41,120","\"Yeah, if you want to beta test it every time we flash this icon spray yourself with water\""]
["04:41,120","04:43,720","\"and just imagine Chris spitting on you.\""]
["04:43,720","04:46,660","\"We've been talking about Susan Worszspitzki.\""]
["04:46,660","04:49,440","\"- I've been hoping to incorporate\""]
["04:49,440","04:51,540","\"Spit Physics into YouTube.\""]
["04:51,540","04:53,620","\"Our new Spit Feature, which makes it\""]

["05:02,380","05:04,820","\"Why does everyone hate the movie\""]
["05:04,820","05:06,920","\"and why does everyone hate the reboot?\""]
["05:06,920","05:09,380","\"- Well the movie and the reboot are like the same thing.\""]
["05:09,380","05:12,740","\"The movie is used as cutscenes throughout the reboot.\""]
["05:12,740","05:13,420","\"What, really?\""]
["05:13,420","05:14,260","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:14,260","05:18,740","\"So all the cutscenes and the reboots just like scenes from the movie.\""]
["05:18,740","05:19,540","\"No way.\""]
["05:19,540","05:20,380","\"I played the reboot.\""]
["05:20,380","05:24,580","\"I hate it, but I keep in mind I've only played like one of these before.\""]
["05:24,580","05:28,060","\"And I don't remember too much of it, which means I probably didn't love it,\""]
["05:28,060","05:29,940","\"but I remembered it being pretty OK.\""]
["05:29,940","05:32,060","\"It's a very pretty game.\""]
["05:32,060","05:32,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:32,700","05:33,140","\"You know me?\""]
["05:33,140","05:36,700","\"All my memories of any Ratchet Clank I've ever played.\""]
["05:36,700","05:42,780","\"And I haven't played a lot, so I'm not exactly kind of sure but it's just kind of a generic like platform\""]
["05:42,780","05:47,060","\"It's not like bad. Oh, you're gonna get killed for saying that people are gonna kill you absolutely\""]
["05:47,060","05:49,980","\"What's I mean, what's not generic about it?\""]
["05:49,980","05:53,820","\"I think it's just like people grew up with it, but it is it is good\""]
["05:53,820","06:00,380","\"It's I I do like a lot of the things in it. So you can't say anything slightly negative about video game\""]
["06:00,380","06:03,100","\"I know I know we are going to take\""]
["06:03,580","06:09,220","\"Your bell and and hammer it don't work. He's getting his bell and hammered to the table for that\""]
["06:09,220","06:11,940","\"I guess I was just more of a jagged extra guy\""]
["06:11,940","06:16,560","\"Yeah, I was too, but I still I still do think ratchet and clank is real cool\""]
["06:16,560","06:20,500","\"I said something along the lines of I tried playing earthbound and couldn't get into it\""]
["06:20,500","06:24,420","\"And I got the most angry like Twitter DMS I've ever seen in my life. Oh, yeah\""]
["06:24,420","06:29,380","\"No, you do not want to try to pull with those people and they're crappy game. That's shit\""]
["06:32,660","06:35,060","\"Everything I've heard is that is that it's a great game\""]
["06:35,060","06:41,980","\"But like I feel like if you've played through it before you'd understand why someone be turned off by the early game like\""]
["06:41,980","06:47,020","\"Grinding JRPG stuff. I didn't even say anything bad. I just said I couldn't get into it\""]
["06:47,020","06:51,260","\"That's enough to piss people off horrendously. I couldn't get into it either\""]
["06:51,260","06:58,220","\"So I'm going down on the ship together. Yeah, I had a similar experience when we were talking about Xenoblade the other day\""]
["06:58,220","07:05,380","\"I don't know I like these guys on Twitter sending me like cutscenes being like just this seemed like a bad game to you\""]
["07:05,380","07:07,380","\"And I'm just like yeah\""]
["07:07,380","07:19,860","\"Popular gaming pinions only plays edition. Let's go. Okay, Devil May Cry the reboot is the but no\""]

["07:31,440","07:35,420","\"We're not serious here. Especially not serious about that one\""]
["07:35,420","07:39,740","\"But I was kidding all of those opinions I said I made up boy\""]

["08:06,660","08:07,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:07,660","08:10,660","\"Because you brought up goon caves at unowny place.\""]
["08:10,660","08:12,660","\"We were gooning together and we said we should submit this.\""]
["08:12,660","08:13,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:13,660","08:14,660","\"Oh, you're expecting us.\""]
["08:14,660","08:16,660","\"If you hold hands when you goon,\""]
["08:16,660","08:19,660","\"it actually multiplies the goonage by toonage.\""]
["08:19,660","08:21,660","\"So, you know.\""]
["08:21,660","08:23,660","\"I cannot help but good with my bros.\""]

["13:27,980","13:33,780","\"In the story you're a good guy, but if you want to kill the NPC as the player and you do it\""]
["13:33,780","13:40,340","\"Do you let the player do it and it just breaks the story or do you prevent them from doing that?\""]
["13:40,340","13:46,640","\"That's tough it is tough isn't it um because I can see why they don't want you to do that\""]
["13:46,640","13:49,540","\"But also let you do it if you want to I don't know\""]
["13:49,780","13:54,500","\"Yeah, I do like when they react in some way shape or form even if they don't like die\""]
["13:54,500","14:00,900","\"You know what like like if they like duck or flinch or something, you know, I like that\""]

["14:58,620","15:02,220","\"Yeah, I think they got a good balance where you can do it, but when you do it\""]
["15:02,220","15:07,800","\"It's kind of like mission failed, but they let you see what you do and then it just like it's like you fucking you fucked up\""]
["15:07,800","15:14,180","\"Go back and do it again. So you just like kick NPCs out windows and like lol. Yeah, that'd be a good idea\""]
["15:15,740","15:19,120","\"Yeah, I don't know. It's a it's a hard choice. It's a it's a line. You got to walk\""]
["15:19,120","15:24,460","\"I mean as an adult with like no restrictions on anything. I just want to see you be able to fuck\""]
