["12:26,420","12:28,420","\"This game did come out in like the 90s.\""]

["12:31,120","12:33,360","\"I think this is literally the furthest I've ever got.\""]

["12:35,520","12:37,520","\"Come here, zombie.\""]
["12:37,520","12:39,120","\"I hate that.\""]
["12:39,120","12:40,320","\"You think you could run by?\""]
["12:40,320","12:42,720","\"Yeah.\""]
["12:42,720","12:44,120","\"Whoo!\""]
["12:44,120","12:45,920","\"You finally have bullets.\""]
["12:45,920","12:48,720","\"That's a zombie in the darkness.\""]
["12:48,720","12:50,520","\"You don't fool me, motherfucker.\""]
["12:50,520","12:52,720","\"He attempted to trick you.\""]
["12:52,720","12:55,520","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["12:55,520","12:58,520","\"You got, you could take your time, get that perfect shot in.\""]
["12:58,520","13:00,320","\"It's pretty small.\""]
["13:00,920","13:13,560","\"Come on. There you go. Oops. Oh fuck. There we go. Oh, oh, nice. Oh, nothing. Really?\""]
["13:13,560","13:20,920","\"Haha. Another document. You can equip yourself with a different weapon. Yeah, no,\""]
["13:20,920","13:26,200","\"by this point, there's no way you haven't run out of bullets at least once. This isn't a very\""]
["13:26,200","13:31,880","\"a very good game. No, we're making real progress here. Yeah, that thing on the left\""]
["13:31,880","13:38,320","\"was a real door, right? Yeah. Okay, buddy. Is that a card reader? What is that? Oh,\""]
["13:38,320","13:49,480","\"fuck. Oh, God, where do you get from? Oh, nice. We got three bullets. Should I just\""]
["13:49,480","13:52,600","\"Okay. Okay. Okay.\""]
["13:52,600","13:56,840","\"Yeah. Nice. Give me your spoils.\""]
["13:56,840","14:02,520","\"What's in here? With the last breath.\""]
["14:02,520","14:04,200","\"Is that a card reader to the right of the door?\""]
["14:04,200","14:07,480","\"Whoo. Not that you have the the card, but\""]
["14:07,480","14:13,160","\"I kind of want to see what happens if I get into a fight with a floor zombie.\""]
["14:13,160","14:15,800","\"Yeah. Sloot his throat when he's on the ground.\""]
["14:15,800","14:17,240","\"See if he's just pathetic.\""]
["14:17,240","14:20,600","\"Oh, oh, there you go.\""]
["14:20,600","14:22,680","\"You basically have to let him.\""]
["14:22,680","14:24,720","\"How come you get to have a second chance?\""]
["14:24,720","14:25,480","\"You muthfucker.\""]
["14:25,480","14:28,240","\"So many people in this country don't.\""]

["14:35,400","14:36,920","\"OK, I think that is a card reader.\""]
["14:36,920","14:37,920","\"I don't know.\""]
["14:37,920","14:40,280","\"Guys are fucking asshole.\""]
["14:40,280","14:41,720","\"Drink from the sink.\""]
["14:41,720","14:44,280","\"Ooh, these are bullets.\""]
["14:44,280","14:48,320","\"Sink bullets. Oh, yeah, you're you. Oh, wait. What what what did I say?\""]
["14:48,320","14:55,220","\"You do not have the shotgun. Oh, there's a gun ammo on the sink. We gotta come back here later\""]
["14:55,220","15:01,480","\"spoilers now. We know there's a shot with the fuck they spoiled the whole fucking game. Let's turn it off\""]
["15:01,480","15:05,800","\"We boopie with the knowledge that there's a shotgun\""]
["15:05,800","15:11,640","\"Generous amount of ammo now shoot this guy. How come the game didn't start like this?\""]
["15:12,800","15:19,160","\"Let's shoot this fucking guy come here. I hate that that's he's just outside. Oh, okay\""]
["15:19,160","15:23,080","\"Aha nice I'm amazing\""]
["15:23,080","15:30,640","\"That was pretty good seems like a headshot does like two HP and like a body shot does one\""]
["15:30,640","15:34,960","\"And they all have four I\""]
["15:34,960","15:37,000","\"Need to find a key\""]
["15:37,000","15:40,800","\"What's in here? This is the key room. Oh no\""]
["15:41,800","15:47,100","\"This is the woman's bathroom you can't be in here. I'm sorry my dear. Where is she?\""]
["15:47,100","15:52,620","\"Okay\""]
["15:52,620","15:57,020","\"Yes\""]
["15:57,020","16:00,420","\"You're getting a lot of headshots now you're getting in the zone\""]
["16:00,420","16:06,620","\"Damn it more shotgun ammo. Oh my god. There's a bunch of shit here. Yeah, herbal compound\""]
["16:06,620","16:09,540","\"What's that smoetus on the ground?\""]
["16:10,140","16:11,580","\"more\""]
["16:11,580","16:13,140","\"Dossier's\""]
["16:13,140","16:19,760","\"It could poison you yeah, like all this would have been helpful earlier. I think that they just didn't want to like info dump on you\""]
["16:19,760","16:21,760","\"Yeah, I don't blame him for that\""]
["16:21,760","16:25,580","\"You bet\""]
["16:25,580","16:32,660","\"Hey, hey these bullets will help with world hunger those that ammo pay dividends sure did\""]
["16:32,660","16:37,660","\"That might be the best noise in video game history that I\""]
["16:39,100","16:41,500","\"I sure am glad we get to hear it a thousand times\""]
["16:41,500","16:49,880","\"They could have like lowered the pitch or something you got behind him. Oh, it did like a preemptive strike. Yeah, that's actually\""]
["16:49,880","16:52,420","\"Time oh\""]
["16:52,420","16:58,100","\"Got the key. Oh the elevators on the west of the ship. Wow zombies drop keys. I I\""]
["16:58,100","17:04,580","\"Kind of hate that that zombies drop either. Yeah, I'm telling you you have to fight every zombie now\""]
["17:04,580","17:08,900","\"That is really not a proper survival heart thing. Yeah\""]
["17:08,900","17:11,620","\"That's not good and if they don't just randomly drop keys\""]
["17:11,620","17:18,420","\"That's even worse because then just one of them drops a key at the beginning and has you thinking that they do that for the whole rest of the game\""]
["17:18,420","17:21,180","\"So we have to go back to the start now and kill all the zombies\""]
["17:21,180","17:23,540","\"Oh\""]
["17:23,540","17:27,700","\"Stuck up by trying to move you can get out of us. I didn't know that you can struggle\""]
["17:27,700","17:30,100","\"Button mash and throw them off. I guess\""]
["17:30,100","17:37,220","\"Oh that looks like a regular dude\""]
["17:38,500","17:41,440","\"Ooh, shotgun shells should I go back and get the shotgun?\""]
["17:41,440","17:44,400","\"Well, didn't you get the shotgun? Oh, you mean from the bathroom?\""]
["17:44,400","17:46,640","\"Wait, why did it give you shells that time? Did that count?\""]
["17:46,640","17:47,900","\"Because I got the shotgun.\""]
["17:47,900","17:51,140","\"Oh, that's right. You did just get it. Yeah, go back in the bathroom.\""]
["17:51,140","17:54,940","\"I just found it on the floor and there was no like visual for it or anything.\""]
["17:54,940","18:00,780","\"Each bathroom had shotgun shells.\""]
["18:00,780","18:07,840","\"I wonder if the shotgun, I assume the shotguns even have a wider reticle than the normal\""]
["18:07,840","18:18,840","\"attacks. I have no fucking idea. That would make sense. I should save it for the boss or whatever's coming up. Oh, yeah, definitely don't waste it on these, on these rank and file zombies.\""]
["18:18,840","18:27,840","\"This fucking soundtrack is actually going to drive me ballasts. What do you mean? It's fucking cool. I bet you can make a really cool song out of this if you tried.\""]
["18:27,840","18:35,040","\"I don't think anything on a two second loop is that tall?\""]
["18:35,040","18:39,640","\"And why do you think they chose to make this a single track song?\""]
["18:39,640","18:42,800","\"Like I know the Game Boys capable of a little more than this, right?\""]
["18:42,800","18:46,840","\"Probably so that they could have zombies go every time they see you.\""]
["18:46,840","18:49,680","\"No again, it clears the memory for that.\""]
["18:49,680","18:53,360","\"So it's still never using more than a single audio track.\""]
["18:53,360","18:57,360","\"Maybe they're just using all the memory for the vintage visuals.\""]
["18:57,360","19:02,360","\"I think it's supposed to be atmospheric like there's not a lot going on so it's like tension building.\""]
["19:02,360","19:04,360","\"Yeah, there's like a bunch of like...\""]
["19:04,360","19:07,360","\"It wouldn't be good, Tomar. It would be stupid dude.\""]
["19:07,360","19:08,360","\"I see.\""]
["19:08,360","19:12,360","\"Tomar, his number one review he ever wrote was \"\"Needs more dung diggidung diggidung.\"\"\""]
["19:12,360","19:16,360","\"Do you know where those elevators are that it was talking about? It's at the west side of the ship.\""]
["19:16,360","19:18,360","\"Oh yeah, you did get an elevator key, right?\""]
["19:18,360","19:20,360","\"I'm gonna just have to kill all zombies now.\""]
["19:20,360","19:22,360","\"Kill all zombies.\""]
["19:22,360","19:32,360","\"That was good. That was good. There he goes. That was kind of cringy for the zombie. Ooh, I'm getting so much fucking bullets.\""]
["19:32,360","19:43,360","\"Do you think that's the Titanic? Yes. What if this is the Titanic? Oh fuck. Well, on the Titanic everyone died so...\""]
["19:43,360","19:51,840","\"So not to say the Titanic would be any better, but any changes probably good odds.\""]
["19:51,840","19:54,420","\"(upbeat music)\""]
