["08:11,600","08:20,120","\"Yeah, it's supposed to but it just says boom. Nah Pokemon stop doing that after a while. The Pokemon near the pond is Osholot. I thought it was push-push\""]
["08:20,120","08:26,720","\"They realize that every creature saying its own name was kind of weird. Osholot naps while floating in the water\""]

["09:51,180","09:57,580","\"I love it when games don't let you interact. You should use all your poke a ball\""]
