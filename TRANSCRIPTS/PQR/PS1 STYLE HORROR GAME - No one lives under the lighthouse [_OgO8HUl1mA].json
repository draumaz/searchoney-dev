["00:09,880","00:12,680","\"I'm down with dads and no one lives under this thing.\""]

["00:14,680","00:15,680","\"No.\""]
["00:15,680","00:19,280","\"Oh, but you're living under it.\""]
["00:19,280","00:20,480","\"You're living in it.\""]

["00:23,760","00:27,840","\"Uh, you don't want to be mean to the creator of this game, dude.\""]
["00:27,840","00:29,280","\"They're kind of crazy.\""]
["00:29,280","00:37,040","\"kind of psycho. Okay, we'll see. No, I'm kidding. I don't know who they are. I'm sorry. It was a joke.\""]
["00:37,040","00:44,800","\"Have you? Oh, that's a guy. Oh, that's cool. Oh, that's sick.\""]
["00:44,800","00:51,360","\"I don't like it. Oh, that was I like this already.\""]
["00:53,200","00:56,080","\"Oh, it's a guest. There's nothing down here.\""]
["00:56,080","01:00,880","\"I like it just started like pretty quickly, huh? Yeah, it was pretty neat.\""]
["01:00,880","01:07,920","\"All right. Well, I felt the little oil thing. Let's see if we can do something about this whole\""]
["01:07,920","01:14,000","\"lighthouse deal. You love holes. Oh, he's a guest. Oh, I can't even answer the door.\""]
["01:14,000","01:19,200","\"Oh, is that what that was? Was someone banging on the door? Yeah, it was the guy you just saw.\""]
["01:22,240","01:33,280","\"Oh wow this is cool. I do that sick. I like shitty old graphics. Yeah no I think it does add a lot to the the weird suspense.\""]
["01:33,280","01:41,920","\"What song is that?\""]
["01:49,920","01:51,920","\"This is what powers the lighthouse.\""]
["01:51,920","01:54,760","\"This pulley system.\""]
["01:54,760","01:56,960","\"This is gravity to turn the little light.\""]
["01:56,960","02:00,000","\"Is that actually how they worked?\""]
["02:00,000","02:02,840","\"I have no idea, but I wouldn't be surprised.\""]
["02:02,840","02:06,160","\"Oh, yeah. Like a grandfather clock kind of thing.\""]
["02:06,160","02:07,960","\"Yeah, it's like winding up a clock.\""]
["02:07,960","02:11,280","\"OK. Oh, how long would that go for?\""]
["02:11,280","02:12,320","\"Just a whole night.\""]
["02:12,320","02:14,040","\"I guess that's the idea.\""]
["02:14,040","02:16,080","\"That's cool.\""]
["02:16,080","02:18,880","\"Oh, oh.\""]
["02:19,400","02:20,760","\"You have to just power the lighthouse.\""]
["02:20,760","02:23,560","\"Yeah, you just put oil in it and it turns the light on.\""]
["02:23,560","02:25,900","\"Wow.\""]
["02:25,900","02:26,960","\"Day one is defeated.\""]
["02:26,960","02:32,440","\"This was just like the kind of intro.\""]
["02:32,440","02:33,680","\"Okay.\""]
["02:33,680","02:38,120","\"That's pretty rad, honestly.\""]
["02:38,120","02:44,520","\"So is that the objective of the game?\""]
["02:44,520","02:45,600","\"Allegedly.\""]
["02:45,600","02:48,720","\"You're just a humble lighthouse operator.\""]
["02:49,120","02:49,960","\"I think so.\""]
["02:49,960","02:51,800","\"Mm-mm.\""]
["02:51,800","02:53,600","\"- Wait, how?\""]
["02:53,600","02:57,120","\"Oh, that guy's gonna crash.\""]
["02:57,120","03:01,200","\"Previous keeper disappeared.\""]
["03:01,200","03:05,280","\"- I suppose ran away on a board.\""]

["03:06,800","03:08,920","\"Depastard.\""]
["03:08,920","03:12,120","\"That is pretty messed up.\""]
["03:12,120","03:13,680","\"- Oh, so this is a new guy.\""]
["03:13,680","03:15,960","\"- Now there's no one on the island.\""]
["03:15,960","03:18,560","\"- I don't think he ran away, dude.\""]
["03:18,560","03:20,820","\"I think instead a haunt might have occurred.\""]
["03:20,820","03:22,160","\"(laughs)\""]
["03:22,160","03:24,840","\"- But ye look like ye know the job, do ye?\""]
["03:24,840","03:30,680","\"- Ye should light slamp on the evening,\""]
["03:30,680","03:33,680","\"should keep working until sunrise.\""]
["03:33,680","03:34,520","\"- Aww.\""]
["03:34,520","03:40,520","\"- Ye also should keep clean all round,\""]
["03:40,520","03:42,520","\"especially the lens itself.\""]
["03:42,520","03:46,160","\"- It's nice of him to walk you through it.\""]
["03:47,400","03:49,400","\"The establishment will\""]

["03:57,040","03:58,040","\"Like we'll find.\""]
["03:58,040","03:59,040","\"I know.\""]
["03:59,040","04:00,040","\"Why doesn't it look?\""]
["04:00,040","04:02,040","\"Don't lose your mind from the loneliness.\""]
["04:02,040","04:06,040","\"I think that's exactly what I'm gonna do.\""]
["04:06,040","04:09,680","\"Fuck.\""]
["04:09,680","04:12,560","\"Wait, are you looking at him?\""]
["04:12,560","04:14,560","\"No, we're in down there in that boat.\""]
["04:14,560","04:16,560","\"Dude, that was good storytelling.\""]
["04:16,560","04:19,200","\"That was what something was looking at you dude.\""]
["04:19,200","04:23,640","\"My favorite part was that you read it because I don't like to read myself.\""]
["04:23,640","04:26,280","\"I'm not much of a reader Tomar.\""]
["04:26,280","04:27,280","\"Fucking seagulls.\""]
["04:27,280","04:29,920","\"Say we're going to want to do a lot of running.\""]
["04:29,920","04:30,920","\"Wow you're fast.\""]
["04:30,920","04:32,160","\"This area is big.\""]
["04:32,160","04:35,600","\"So how inspired by this is the lighthouse?\""]
["04:35,600","04:37,880","\"I mean how inspired from the lighthouse is this?\""]
["04:37,880","04:43,120","\"I think they openly say in the game description that it's very much based on the lighthouse.\""]
["04:43,120","04:45,040","\"- Oh, I've never seen the lighthouse.\""]
["04:45,040","04:46,920","\"Will it spoil that movie for me?\""]
["04:46,920","04:48,000","\"- No, no.\""]
["04:48,000","04:48,840","\"- Okay.\""]
["04:48,840","04:50,000","\"- It's definitely got its own thing.\""]
["04:50,000","04:53,760","\"It's just, it's inspired by like the vibe of the lighthouse.\""]
["04:53,760","04:54,800","\"- All right.\""]
["04:54,800","04:56,320","\"That was actually a really bitch\""]
["04:56,320","04:57,440","\"and opening sequence.\""]
["04:57,440","05:00,320","\"Like it definitely did enough to be like,\""]
["05:00,320","05:01,380","\"what the fuck?\""]
["05:01,380","05:04,440","\"I love this kind of stuff.\""]
["05:04,440","05:05,920","\"- Got a little, what is that?\""]
["05:05,920","05:09,560","\"- It's a little cellar full of sandbags.\""]
["05:09,560","05:10,560","\"- Oh.\""]
["05:10,560","05:12,740","\"- Got a little shack over here.\""]

["05:19,340","05:21,240","\"Please dear god be safe\""]
["05:21,240","05:27,140","\"Don't do that fucking asshole\""]
["05:27,140","05:32,540","\"It's like this is where I'll be sleeping oh\""]
["05:32,540","05:40,740","\"No, oh what a mess someone left their brown slime on the ground oh\""]
["05:42,140","05:44,140","\"More food for you\""]
["05:44,140","05:50,740","\"Nice prepare the brown slime. There's a nice piece of like uncut bacon. Oh brighter slime\""]
["05:50,740","05:54,940","\"I'll have the bright brown slime tonight, honey. Oh\""]
["05:54,940","05:59,620","\"My god, I would smash that clock in a heartbeat\""]
["05:59,620","06:03,300","\"Yeah, look a little coin\""]
["06:03,300","06:08,260","\"Probably obnoxious slot for the little coin. I can't sleep with clocks ticking\""]
["06:09,740","06:11,960","\"Ooh. And the key to the lighthouse.\""]
["06:11,960","06:35,260","\"[mimics\""]

["06:42,180","06:48,300","\"Just gonna carry it to protect myself. Can you who it's getting darker. This is scary\""]
["06:48,300","06:53,840","\"Here's to be darkening. Is there like a time system or I think it's just event-based\""]
["06:53,840","06:56,400","\"I don't think time actually passes in real time\""]
["06:56,400","07:01,260","\"I very much like this so far\""]
["07:01,260","07:08,140","\"Also, this guy's already fucking freaking out and carrying across with him everywhere he goes like yeah\""]
["07:08,140","07:09,740","\"I don't think you were supposed to pick that up yet.\""]
["07:09,740","07:11,660","\"I bet that's something you pick up later.\""]
["07:11,660","07:13,980","\"- Yeah, Tomar knows too much. - It looks good.\""]

["08:42,920","08:47,840","\"You know nothing about Newton's third law. I don't know that's how bouncing works\""]
["08:47,840","08:54,480","\"An object in motion stays in motion and has an equal to opposite reaction\""]
["08:54,480","09:00,480","\"No, it would have stays in motion if it's covered in low gravity's acting against it the whole time\""]
["09:00,480","09:06,620","\"So it would bounce lower with each successive bounce. You could never bounce all the way up to your starting point\""]
["09:06,620","09:12,300","\"Listen smartass just fill up the the canister and then we'll see what bounced back up\""]
["09:12,300","09:15,680","\"All right\""]
