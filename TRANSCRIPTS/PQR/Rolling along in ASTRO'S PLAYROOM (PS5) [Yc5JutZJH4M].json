["02:53,360","02:56,280","\"All right, just because you played this 94 times already\""]
["02:56,280","03:02,440","\"Not even bottles of beer on the wall you take law down make him drown you could try\""]

["03:27,120","03:32,520","\"I thought the ps3 was a little bit like me. I thought the ps3\""]
["03:32,520","03:36,820","\"Well, I used to watch like pirated movies on the ps3 and listen to music and store stuff on it\""]
["03:36,820","03:38,820","\"And it had a really nice like\""]
["03:38,820","03:45,000","\"Simple interface and then the ps4 came out with their windows 10 tablet ask fucking nonsense on the menu that I can never figure out\""]
["03:45,000","03:51,740","\"I just like the ps3 butter. See I feel like the ps3 era like the Xbox 360 was kind of\""]
["03:51,740","03:58,340","\"The the console that I tended towards more oh me too and most of America\""]
["03:58,340","04:00,300","\"So what do I know?\""]
["04:00,300","04:04,820","\"I felt like the ps4 just straight up like one that last generation\""]
["04:04,820","04:12,140","\"Not like that matters really but I feel like everybody felt that even like I remember at that e3 everyone was making a big deal\""]
["04:12,140","04:18,820","\"about how the PS4 was going to be cheaper than the Xbox one and how it just they were\""]
["04:18,820","04:23,700","\"just straight up going to let people still share games which you know then the Xbox one\""]
["04:23,700","04:32,300","\"it you know went back on that the Xbox straight up was not going to let you like hand over\""]
["04:32,300","04:36,700","\"your games to another person I forgot they were gonna I think there was a lot of pushback\""]
["04:36,700","04:41,980","\"for consumers and from GameStop. It would have killed a huge part of their\""]
["04:41,980","04:46,660","\"business. I forgot about that too. Yeah that that's that would have been really\""]
["04:46,660","04:52,260","\"stupid. I hope that they never try it again. Yeah me too. But yeah I got an\""]
["04:52,260","04:58,260","\"Xbox One and I I'm not even exaggerating when I say I literally own one game for\""]
["04:58,260","05:04,020","\"it and that game is Halo 5. Xbox One you know what's strongly regret. You spent\""]
["05:04,020","05:11,240","\"Fucking $500 for Halo. No, I got it off somebody used. Okay. It was not nearly that much\""]
["05:11,240","05:14,440","\"But it was uh it was not my best purchase\""]
["05:14,440","05:19,760","\"Exparce one I never bought one. That was the same with me in the Wii U. It's gonna say like I've\""]
["05:19,760","05:25,960","\"For the last few generations I've kept up with most consoles, but this guy's having a fucking blast\""]
["05:25,960","05:29,240","\"He loves that he made his friend buff. He sure does\""]
["05:29,240","05:31,880","\"fucking die\""]
["05:31,880","05:39,840","\"I'd say my favorite thing about these new consoles though is that they are backwards\""]
["05:39,840","05:41,560","\"compatible.\""]
["05:41,560","05:43,120","\"Look at me.\""]
["05:43,120","05:44,240","\"Can you believe he looks at me?\""]
["05:44,240","05:45,240","\"Can you believe it?\""]
["05:45,240","05:51,000","\"I mean the upside is that they're probably all going to remain just normal like x86 architecture\""]
["05:51,000","05:53,840","\"for the sake of like multi-platform releases.\""]
["05:53,840","05:59,360","\"So backwards compatibility is like at least with all the other x86 based stuff is going\""]
["05:59,360","06:07,280","\"to be pretty straightforward. That'd be good. I was really, really bummed when like the PlayStation\""]
["06:07,280","06:11,720","\"4 came out and it just like wasn't backwards compatible with anything. But it's because they\""]
["06:11,720","06:18,000","\"decided to go with their whole wacky like like billion core architect. What was that chip called?\""]
["06:18,000","06:22,960","\"I don't know. But I know what you're talking about. The PlayStation 3 had some weird thing where it\""]
["06:22,960","06:25,680","\"It like created ram out of other\""]
["06:25,680","06:31,560","\"Like components. I don't know what it fucking did, but you know what I'm talking about right Tomar\""]
["06:31,560","06:34,160","\"I think we've had this conversation yet\""]
["06:34,160","06:41,040","\"No, it did a lot of really unique stuff which I think made a lot of people hate porting to it\""]
["06:41,040","06:47,960","\"Yeah, I remember that was a running thing where PlayStation 3 ports of stuff would often be like\""]
["06:47,960","06:51,160","\"Kind of crappy because the architecture was so different\""]
["06:51,320","06:58,720","\"But PlayStation 3 exclusives like looked really really good. Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 4 still looks really fucking good now\""]
["06:58,720","07:02,800","\"It seems like yeah things that we're able to actually leverage that technology by design\""]
["07:02,800","07:08,320","\"Ran great. I hate that there's no version of Metal Gear 4 that you could just play now\""]
["07:08,320","07:12,800","\"Yeah, I think that platform is the exact reason why oh\""]
["07:12,800","07:16,200","\"Yeah, they're not able to port that right yeah, they'd have to either\""]
["07:16,920","07:22,520","\"Get a strong system to emulate it, which I think would actually be pretty tough this rocks look what I'm doing here\""]
["07:22,520","07:27,760","\"You like that and you hold down that and it's got the haptic feedback. That's so cool\""]
["07:27,760","07:30,440","\"Here you try\""]
["07:30,440","07:32,440","\"Alright, how's it work? Oh, I just\""]
["07:32,440","07:37,240","\"I know it feels good. I\""]
["07:37,240","07:40,760","\"Love this game honestly\""]
["07:40,760","07:42,000","\"It's\""]
["07:42,000","07:46,720","\"Yeah, it's really cool like for something that comes like free. It's a great freebie\""]
["07:46,720","07:52,880","\"It really is and it's it's literally just designed to be like look what your new thing can do\""]
["07:52,880","07:57,320","\"I'm glad they found a way to innovate the controller. That doesn't feel like a shitty gimmick\""]
["07:57,320","08:01,640","\"It actually feels like you're a kid and you just got the console and you didn't get any games yet\""]
["08:01,640","08:06,680","\"This I assume this is free right? Yeah, so you'd at least have this\""]
["08:07,160","08:12,140","\"This would be a good thing to spend some time on getting used to your new system while you waited to get\""]
["08:12,140","08:16,660","\"Yeah, some first game some six year old is gonna play like a hundred hours of this\""]
["08:16,660","08:19,980","\"Absolutely six year old me definitely would have\""]
["08:19,980","08:26,800","\"Yeah, look at him go now toomers having fun. We tumors having a whole one\""]

["20:34,860","20:39,060","\"It had that problem of having too much stars that are really annoying to collect.\""]
["20:39,060","20:43,620","\"Yeah, I think part of that though was because it was on the switch\""]
["20:43,620","20:47,660","\"I feel like a lot of switch games because the console kind of like pops off\""]
["20:47,660","20:52,340","\"Yeah, designed to kind of be played for like 15 minutes if you want, you know what I mean?\""]
["20:52,340","20:52,780","\"Yeah\""]
["20:52,780","20:57,780","\"So rather than having like one star that takes like 20 minutes to get there like oh, yeah\""]
["20:57,780","21:00,540","\"Let's just put a bunch of them in there that take like five minutes to get\""]
["21:00,540","21:03,500","\"Look at that\""]
["21:03,500","21:05,420","\"Yes\""]

["21:32,820","21:38,300","\"Well, oh you like that he likes them. I think he got mad cuz you hit the glass\""]
["21:38,300","21:41,280","\"Is that what happened? It's hitting the glass\""]
["21:41,280","21:50,420","\"He hits you back. That's so cool. You don't know this yet, but you're like a cultural sacrifice\""]

["22:07,580","22:14,460","\"Look look at that. You can go so slow. That is a super nice detail and the animation is like different in it or is it?\""]
["22:14,460","22:16,300","\"Yeah\""]
["22:16,300","22:18,300","\"Yeah, I like that a lot. I\""]
["22:18,300","22:22,720","\"Also like in first-person shooter games when you look down you can see your legs\""]
["22:23,620","22:30,340","\"Yeah, and body most of them do that now, but I remember back in the day like almost none of them did that\""]
