["05:00,400","05:04,140","\"You like that's your powers that you never need sleepies\""]
["05:04,140","05:10,300","\"Think about how many more calories you would burn not laying sedentary for like eight hours a day\""]

["05:34,500","05:40,860","\"And if we could use the full 95 percent, we could unlock many superpowers. Yeah, I always say that yeah\""]
["05:40,860","05:47,420","\"Say that on a regular basis. Oh my god. It's unlocking the other 95% of your brain\""]
["05:47,420","05:52,940","\"I think on a daily basis. Yeah, you have that that bottled drink that you say improves brain health\""]
["05:52,940","05:58,220","\"That's correct. Yeah, that's my um my june saying my june saying you\""]
["05:58,860","06:00,860","\"Wait what?\""]

["06:17,860","06:19,860","\"I'm familiar with this one because I edited\""]
["06:19,860","06:22,860","\"your last playthrough of it.\""]
["06:22,860","06:24,860","\"But this is definitely not how it starts.\""]
["06:24,860","06:26,860","\"This guy should have killed her by now.\""]
["06:26,860","06:33,180","\"That actually is scary. What's the better? I've never actually played any version of Resident Evil 3 before\""]
["06:33,180","06:35,740","\"This is all new to me\""]
["06:35,740","06:38,580","\"This actually is pretty scary. He's gigantic\""]
["06:38,580","06:46,660","\"He's an intimidating figure. Honestly Nemesis one of the most iconic video game bad guys. He's like he's basically zombie Terminator\""]
["06:46,660","06:53,380","\"Yeah, he's awesome. Isn't Jill supposed to be a cop or something? Well, she's a star. She's a number of stars\""]
["06:53,580","06:58,260","\"Yeah, they're like a SWAT team. So she's like a super elite cop even\""]
["06:58,260","07:03,940","\"But did that get established here? She's just a lady right now. I mean this is the third game\""]
["07:03,940","07:06,460","\"So it's not the first game who she is\""]
["07:06,460","07:11,700","\"No, this is a new foe. She's never seen this guy before\""]
["07:11,700","07:15,220","\"I was asking so this is she was just like reading something and this dude just broke through it\""]
["07:15,220","07:17,220","\"Like he just shows up like terminator\""]
["07:18,140","07:23,740","\"Zach so basically in the first game you're sent into the woods to like look at this matching because you're like a SWAT team\""]
["07:23,740","07:27,820","\"Right because there's like a bunch of grizzly murders and all this other crap\""]
["07:27,820","07:34,380","\"But when you go in you find out that uh, there's a bunch of zombies there from experiments done by this medical corporation called umbrella\""]
["07:34,380","07:37,820","\"Yeah, that butters I know that plot like the whole thing about your own\""]
["07:37,820","07:44,620","\"So my god, so now this umbrella made this guy to like take you out because you're trying to expose them for what they did\""]
["07:44,620","07:47,840","\"Oh, okay, okay, they made this big fucking monster\""]
["07:47,840","07:50,320","\"Is he beholden to the umbrella thing?\""]
["07:50,320","07:54,660","\"What do you mean? Like is he? Does he take their orders?\""]
["07:54,660","07:59,000","\"Yeah, here's he is. Yeah, you know he's a little lap dog\""]
["07:59,000","08:03,400","\"This is like this is like that truck chase for segment you too\""]
["08:03,400","08:12,260","\"And then spoiler alert at the end of the game Jill spills a glass of water and he gets afraid of it\""]
["08:12,260","08:15,560","\"And she's afraid of regular water\""]
["08:15,560","08:17,660","\"Exactly like that fucking embit shovel\""]
["08:17,660","08:23,160","\"I don't know the biggest enemy is water. She's just gonna chit chat with this guy\""]
["08:23,160","08:25,640","\"Oh after that giant monster almost killed her\""]
["08:25,640","08:29,720","\"And I don't know what the hell that thing was\""]
["08:29,720","08:35,460","\"Maybe we should get out of here babe. I don't know how much longer we have you know\""]
["08:35,460","08:38,560","\"This might be our last chance to like kiss or have sex or something\""]
["08:38,560","08:42,740","\"I don't know I'm just saying like if you wanted to look like people are ready like\""]
["08:43,160","08:46,640","\"Sirens going up. I guess we might as well just fuck. I mean, it's sirens going up and people are running\""]
["08:46,640","08:48,640","\"I mean that doesn't happen that often\""]
["08:48,640","08:52,040","\"I just fucking ran through a poll. Yeah, that guy is an idiot\""]
["08:52,040","08:58,520","\"So this is just as society started to collapse pretty much. Yeah, the outbreaks happening\""]
["08:58,520","09:02,140","\"So this isn't just nemesis. There's other zombies out there too\""]
["09:02,140","09:08,760","\"The zombie outbreak yes, and Jill's been trying to warn the entire town up until this point. Nobody listened to her\""]
["09:09,400","09:13,840","\"They're like this is raccoon city nothing bad ever happens here pretty much\""]
["09:13,840","09:17,960","\"To be fair she does look a little bit like a chicken little bitch\""]
["09:17,960","09:22,180","\"She doesn't like chicken little shit. Yeah, she reminds me chicken little for that movie\""]
["09:22,180","09:25,080","\"Oh\""]
["09:25,080","09:28,720","\"There's silly people coming. There's just like they're goofing around over here\""]
["09:28,720","09:36,480","\"Prank\""]
["09:36,480","09:38,480","\"- That's like, right? - That's a good scene.\""]
["09:38,480","09:40,480","\"- Wait, what just happened?\""]
["09:40,480","09:43,080","\"- I'll try not to do that again.\""]
["09:43,080","09:44,720","\"- Why did that happen?\""]
["09:44,720","09:46,560","\"- 'Cause I walked right into him, like an idiot.\""]
["09:46,560","09:47,400","\"- Brad's kinda not--\""]
["09:47,400","09:49,680","\"- Just sort of lived his whole life without consequences,\""]
["09:49,680","09:52,160","\"as is evidenced by his name being Brad,\""]
["09:52,160","09:55,840","\"so it's about time he had a little bit of a wake up call.\""]
["09:55,840","09:57,400","\"- What the hell, when did this happen?\""]
["09:57,400","09:59,120","\"When did this get put behind me?\""]
["09:59,120","10:02,200","\"- Good luck now.\""]
["10:02,200","10:03,720","\"- What the fuck?\""]
["10:03,720","10:06,400","\"- Okay, it's just a little musical chairs\""]
["10:06,400","10:13,520","\"game. What why would she not try to run? That was awesome. Because she's hurt. She's touching her tummy.\""]
["10:13,520","10:18,640","\"She has a tummy at Chris. Yeah, I feel like something's wrong. I feel like my controller's not working or something.\""]
["10:18,640","10:26,000","\"Jill's got a boo boo and her belly button's gonna collapse out of her if she runs. Oh no, Brad!\""]
["10:33,840","10:35,840","\"We're gonna make a river\""]
["10:35,840","10:51,880","\"Is he from the first movie or the first game what is he for the pilot look now I'm walking again what the fuck is this\""]
["10:51,880","10:55,540","\"Now you're still holding your tummy tum. Yeah\""]
["10:55,540","11:00,720","\"But she was running into cutscenes she ran in the door. Yeah, but until you get a pepto bismol\""]
["11:00,720","11:02,720","\"She's not gonna be able to sprint in game. So\""]
["11:02,720","11:06,680","\"you mean this don't you go look at me\""]
["11:06,680","11:10,960","\"apologize to that fucking green dead man\""]
["11:10,960","11:14,120","\"she's polite well she's basically\""]
["11:14,120","11:15,720","\"stripping him of the second amendment\""]
["11:15,720","11:17,880","\"right so yeah maybe an apology is in\""]
["11:17,880","11:27,400","\"order drawing I'm just gonna try to not\""]
["11:27,400","11:29,480","\"to go near them I would advise that you\""]
["11:29,480","11:31,760","\"draw and this guy's look really good\""]
["11:31,760","11:37,440","\"though. Let's keep walking you guys. This would be our would be pry. Did you scare\""]
["11:37,440","11:47,900","\"you? Oh there's a dodge button okay. Can you roll before you can run? Nope.\""]
["11:47,900","11:51,600","\"Because that's the way that children do it right? First you learn to crawl then\""]
["11:51,600","11:56,300","\"you learn to walk then you learn to roll then you learn to run. You say\""]
["11:56,300","11:58,380","\"- I think Rolly happens after walking.\""]
["11:58,380","12:01,180","\"- Yeah, it happens after walking, but prior to running.\""]
["12:01,180","12:03,940","\"- I think Rolly happens after running in some cases.\""]
["12:03,940","12:05,940","\"I've heard of hundreds of papers saying so.\""]
["12:05,940","12:07,260","\"- I feel like you learn how to roll\""]
