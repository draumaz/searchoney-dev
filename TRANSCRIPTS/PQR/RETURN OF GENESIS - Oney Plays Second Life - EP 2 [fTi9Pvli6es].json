["00:01,600","00:03,340","\"Only play!\""]
["00:03,340","00:04,300","\"*clapping*\""]
["00:04,300","00:19,320","\"I- Oh, where there he is.\""]
["00:19,320","00:19,820","\"Yep.\""]
["00:19,820","00:20,800","\"*phone ringing*\""]
["00:20,800","00:23,940","\"Hello Vincent!\""]
["00:23,940","00:26,080","\"Wait, his name is Genesis.\""]
["00:26,080","00:27,500","\"I mean Genesis?\""]
["00:27,500","00:33,260","\"Well, it's kind of his last name's Valentine.\""]
["00:33,260","00:38,880","\"It's been a while since we last met, huh?\""]
["00:38,880","00:43,060","\"Have you killed any people in battle since?\""]
["00:43,060","00:48,460","\"Quite a few, actually.\""]
["00:48,460","00:49,460","\"Like who?\""]
["00:49,460","00:58,540","\"Yeah. Glad a few assassins of another notable noble family on here.\""]
["00:58,540","01:02,100","\"I see you've got a new crown. Where'd you get that?\""]
["01:02,100","01:08,100","\"No, I've had it for a while. It's my royal family crown. I just don't wear it much.\""]
["01:08,100","01:14,140","\"Wow. Can I have your crown?\""]
["01:14,140","01:22,300","\"Sorry, the only way this crown will leave the top of my skull is the day when my son\""]
["01:22,300","01:26,380","\"takes over as patriarch and ruler of the family.\""]
["01:26,380","01:27,380","\"Is he?\""]
["01:27,380","01:31,460","\"Can I be your son?\""]
["01:31,460","01:34,300","\"How can I get in on this family action?\""]
["01:34,300","01:37,180","\"I'd like to be a knight.\""]
["01:37,180","01:41,220","\"Well there are three ways to join my family.\""]
["01:41,220","01:51,220","\"Each one requires passing a few rigorous tests that are designed to break people's spirits, bodies, and minds.\""]
["01:51,220","01:59,220","\"Only those who are strong enough and honorable enough can count themselves among my family.\""]
["01:59,220","02:03,220","\"I'm willing to partake in this rigorous trial.\""]
["02:05,220","02:13,220","\"It's not just one trial. It's fighting every single of the strongest warriors of my family, one on one.\""]
["02:13,220","02:14,220","\"*laughs*\""]
["02:14,220","02:16,220","\"Whoa!\""]
["02:16,220","02:19,220","\"But think about this.\""]
["02:19,220","02:23,220","\"If I kill your family, you won't have a family, Melmore. How does that work?\""]
["02:23,220","02:29,220","\"Oh, it's not a duel to the death. It's just fighting as to where we cannot fight anymore.\""]
["02:29,220","02:32,220","\"Basically making us yield in battle.\""]
["02:34,220","02:36,220","\"Wow, that's pretty cool.\""]
["02:36,220","02:39,220","\"If you can make us stop fighting, then you've passed.\""]
["02:39,220","02:43,220","\"If you resort to lethal techniques to win,\""]
["02:43,220","02:46,220","\"I will personally jump in the fight and cut your head off\""]
["02:46,220","02:52,220","\"and use your skull as a wine glass for the foreseeable future.\""]
["02:52,220","02:53,220","\"What?\""]
["02:53,220","02:58,220","\"Why would you do that?\""]
["02:58,220","03:02,220","\"If anyone so much as kills a member of my family\""]
["03:02,220","03:12,720","\"that I will personally end their existence. I will literally erase them from complete and utter existence.\""]
["03:12,720","03:23,220","\"Whoa, I wanted to ask you. Last time we talked, you told me you killed somebody with your carnage sword in real life through your computer.\""]
["03:23,220","03:24,220","\"Is this...\""]
["03:24,220","03:28,220","\"Oh, it doesn't kill... it doesn't actually kill them. It just kills their computer.\""]
["03:28,220","03:30,220","\"Their computer?\""]
["03:30,220","03:35,140","\"Yeah, it fries their computer to where they cannot turn it on. They have to basically buy a new one.\""]
["03:35,140","03:38,280","\"Are you... are you really? Is this real?\""]
["03:38,280","03:43,360","\"Yes, that's why I don't use the carnage one because it's a little too overpowered.\""]
["03:43,360","03:47,820","\"You mean it literally fries the inside of their real PC?\""]
["03:47,820","03:53,580","\"Yes, it fries every bit of it. Their tower, their modem, everything gone.\""]
["03:53,580","03:55,940","\"Where did you get this weapon?\""]
["03:55,940","03:59,660","\"Oh, it came with the one I'm wielding right now.\""]
["03:59,660","04:05,900","\"I bought one and it gave me six different ones. One for each combat meter on SL.\""]
["04:05,900","04:09,540","\"But why would they allow it to fry computers?\""]
["04:09,540","04:15,340","\"Oh, they didn't know that they made their weapon that strong. They never realized it.\""]
["04:15,340","04:20,620","\"Until I was able to find a little handy trick in the weapon.\""]
["04:20,620","04:23,980","\"How did you do that? You're so cool.\""]
["04:23,980","04:28,140","\"Practice. It's the old adage. Practice makes perfect.\""]
["04:28,140","04:29,140","\"Wow.\""]
["04:29,140","04:33,140","\"Can we meet your family?\""]
["04:33,140","04:36,440","\"Well, when my wife gets back on.\""]
["04:36,440","04:40,640","\"I'm the second youngest daughter doesn't have internet right now\""]
["04:40,640","04:43,240","\"because her family can't pay their lecture bill.\""]
["04:43,240","04:45,140","\"Oh, no.\""]
["04:45,140","04:49,340","\"Whoa, who's this person?\""]
["04:49,340","04:52,040","\"That is my wife.\""]
["04:52,040","04:54,040","\"Wow, my queen.\""]
["04:54,040","04:55,940","\"Whoa.\""]
["04:57,240","04:58,500","\"Whoa!\""]
["04:58,500","05:00,040","\"Yep.\""]
["05:00,040","05:01,940","\"That's cool.\""]
["05:01,940","05:02,540","\"It gets done a lot.\""]
["05:02,540","05:05,040","\"She's beautiful.\""]
["05:05,040","05:07,140","\"I know.\""]
["05:07,140","05:08,540","\"You're a lucky man.\""]
["05:08,540","05:10,440","\"Yes, I am.\""]
["05:10,440","05:11,940","\"And believe it or not,\""]
["05:11,940","05:14,340","\"she's just as strong as me in battle.\""]
["05:14,340","05:15,540","\"What?\""]
["05:15,540","05:19,340","\"She's never been beaten once.\""]
["05:19,340","05:21,740","\"Wow.\""]
["05:26,540","05:28,540","\"She's pretty easy to move around though.\""]
["05:28,540","05:36,400","\"Will she talk to us?\""]
["05:36,400","05:48,000","\"Whoa.\""]
["05:48,000","05:50,380","\"Who's this little person?\""]
["05:50,380","05:57,100","\"if she were to actually fight against you she shattered you in pieces. I was just\""]

["06:48,340","06:53,340","\"When I get done with you, you'll know what true fear and despair looks like.\""]
