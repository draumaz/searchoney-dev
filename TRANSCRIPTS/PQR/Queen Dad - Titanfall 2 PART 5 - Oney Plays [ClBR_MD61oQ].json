["11:29,840","11:30,840","\"What is it?\""]
["11:30,840","11:31,840","\"What is it?\""]
["11:31,840","11:32,840","\"It's gross\""]
["11:32,840","11:36,840","\"It's when people buy those little anime figures and then jerk off on them\""]
["11:36,840","11:38,340","\"Yeah, they call it hot glue\""]
["11:38,340","11:41,340","\"Because cum and hot glue will be the exact same\""]

["11:54,840","11:57,840","\"Oh you gotta turn them all off and then jump.\""]
["11:57,840","11:59,840","\"This is so fucking awesome.\""]
["11:59,840","12:04,840","\"This is what platforming in like a shooter should always fucking be.\""]
["12:04,840","12:08,340","\"Like, InnerSpar shooting with platforming. It's so fun.\""]
["12:08,340","12:13,840","\"It kind of bums me out that Apex Legends, they had to crank down how much you could move so much.\""]
["12:13,840","12:15,840","\"Really? I've never played the game.\""]
["12:15,840","12:17,280","\"Yeah, it's kind of fun.\""]
["12:17,280","12:21,360","\"Like it has about half of the things you can do in this game.\""]
["12:21,360","12:25,320","\"Like it has the slide and stuff, but you can't run on walls.\""]
["12:25,320","12:28,920","\"One guy has the grappling hook, but it's not as good.\""]
["12:28,920","12:31,000","\"And you can only use it like every six minutes.\""]
["12:31,000","12:34,920","\"That's dumb because like they do that because they don't want like things to be overpowered.\""]
["12:34,920","12:36,560","\"But I feel like everybody should have a grappling hook.\""]
["12:36,560","12:39,320","\"Considering it's a fucking massive open world area.\""]
["12:39,320","12:39,680","\"Yeah.\""]
["12:39,680","12:42,000","\"And you can already move insanely crazy.\""]

["12:45,040","12:49,040","\"I don't know if I call it balanced, but it's real fun. I played the multiplayer. I wasn't good at it\""]
["12:49,040","12:52,420","\"But I appreciated what it was. Do people still play Apex Legends?\""]
["12:52,420","12:58,040","\"I don't know I I assume because they're still doing more seasons and stuff for it\""]
["12:58,040","13:03,600","\"But I'm sure that that game will will inevitably destroy its own art direction too and be annoying\""]
["13:03,600","13:08,280","\"Everybody will be running around as like an elf or a snowman or something\""]
["13:08,280","13:14,480","\"They've already started like the main assassin character can wear an elf suit or like wear like a fucking Elvis outfit\""]

["13:43,960","13:46,680","\"Yeah, I hate the smell of hot glue you want in true story\""]
["13:46,680","13:52,480","\"I used to have a hot glue gun and I used to make like we were talking about come but okay\""]
["13:52,480","13:54,760","\"Well, that's the joke term\""]
["13:54,760","13:58,840","\"But like you can actually use hot glue to put it on your fingers because you can take it off easily\""]
["13:58,840","14:04,160","\"Why would you put hot glue in your fingers? Yeah, it doesn't sound like fun at all. It's a it's a joke\""]
["14:04,160","14:11,280","\"Okay, you can put hot glue on them. I'm not sure I get it, but I like it. It's a funny joke\""]
["14:12,560","14:18,480","\"I'm lawless, but I used to have a hot glue gun because I didn't want to use staples anymore. Yeah, and\""]
["14:18,480","14:20,880","\"like\""]
["14:20,880","14:24,800","\"they it fuck I hate the fucking smell of burning glue and\""]
["14:24,800","14:27,960","\"What do you use hot glue guns for like honestly?\""]
["14:27,960","14:34,380","\"You glue something in a drizzie real fast do they use it like as in something as a replacement for like a staple?\""]
["14:34,380","14:38,440","\"I mean anything you need to glue you know what?\""]
["14:40,040","14:46,120","\"Yeah, I don't understand what's actually you rather use super glue or hot glue and the idea of hot glue is you put it on\""]
["14:46,120","14:50,720","\"And it dries like instantly where a super glue takes like half an hour. Oh, you're playing. Why are we talking about?\""]
["14:50,720","14:55,460","\"Cory can play with the dragon ball Vegeta. He breaks his head off. What are you gonna do with him?\""]
["14:55,460","14:57,460","\"Put a hot glue in his neck and fix it\""]
["14:57,460","15:01,860","\"Honestly, when it breaks something I consider it broken and don't fix it. That's a fair point\""]
["15:01,860","15:05,020","\"I don't really feel the need to like if I smash a pot together\""]
["15:05,020","15:08,740","\"I'm not gonna do what they do in a cartoon and put it together in pieces. I'm just gonna get a new pot\""]
["15:08,740","15:11,060","\"Is that why both of your elbows are bent backwards?\""]
["15:11,060","15:18,980","\"Actually, that's because I challenged an out another alpha man over a beautiful bride\""]
["15:18,980","15:26,060","\"To me he did put me in my place as they say, but I still feel like I learned a lot from that fight\""]
["15:26,060","15:29,500","\"He broke your arm in just the way that it could heal again\""]
["15:29,500","15:33,740","\"Yeah, do you know you could possibly do that to make it stronger what?\""]
["15:33,740","15:35,100","\"Shatter someone's arm\""]
["15:35,100","15:40,680","\"But like break it so they can heal faster a lot of people in China break their legs and then heal them so that they get taller\""]

["16:48,280","16:49,280","\"No, this is kind of annoying.\""]
["16:49,280","16:52,380","\"I was going to say they always put the shit in games where you have to move big things\""]

["16:55,680","16:56,680","\"Dude, this one tastes so long.\""]

["17:25,160","17:28,860","\"That said I would totally play a full game where you just have that time thing that you\""]
["17:28,860","17:32,660","\"They should bring that back in time fault 3 and just make it apart\""]
["17:32,660","17:36,760","\"It should just be like moves that you unlock like you make your Titan insanely powerful\""]
["17:36,760","17:38,840","\"That you can make your Titan stop time\""]
["17:38,840","17:43,940","\"like control time where you go through the future and through the past or like you can like um I\""]

["18:43,560","18:48,360","\"they really don't like having anyone new come to their bar\""]
["18:49,400","18:57,680","\"100% serious they want regular customers, but they hate anyone new who comes in because they're constantly like making your first\""]

["19:30,560","19:34,160","\"It's like don't fucking card me because then doesn't make me want to come back ever again\""]
["19:34,160","19:37,140","\"And if you're gonna card me quit forgetting my fucking\""]

["22:09,340","22:12,660","\"I forget what it is, but it had a moral in there somewhere\""]
["22:12,660","22:15,760","\"What the oil is more valuable than water\""]
["22:15,760","22:21,620","\"Yeah, and that we should invade other countries and take it weren't invading they were in like Egypt\""]
["22:21,620","22:24,820","\"Oh, so they owned the property in Egypt. They found oil on no\""]
