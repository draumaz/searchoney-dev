["04:23,760","04:30,400","\"Yeah, we should incorporate that and know he plays just flash on the screen when you should get spit on and\""]
["04:30,400","04:34,880","\"Yeah, when the technology comes along we'll already have like a trigger\""]
["04:35,600","04:43,240","\"If you want to beta test it every time we flash this icon spray yourself with water and just imagine Chris spitting on you\""]
["04:43,240","04:46,160","\"We've been talking about woo Susan will spit ski\""]
["04:46,160","04:52,880","\"I've been hoping to incorporate spit physics into YouTube our new spit feature\""]

["04:56,240","04:59,360","\"But incorporate spit for all the advertisers\""]
["04:59,360","05:02,600","\"So what's the deal with ratchet and clank why?\""]
["05:03,200","05:06,320","\"Does everyone hate the movie and what has everyone hate the reboot?\""]
["05:06,320","05:12,560","\"Well the movie and the reboot are like the same thing. Oh the movie is used as cutscenes throughout the reboot\""]
["05:12,560","05:19,200","\"What really? Yeah, so all the cutscenes and the reboots just like scenes from the movie. No way\""]
["05:19,200","05:20,360","\"I played the reboot\""]
["05:20,360","05:21,200","\"I hate it\""]
["05:21,200","05:26,040","\"But I keep in mind I've only played like one of these before and I don't remember too much of it\""]
["05:26,040","05:31,440","\"Which which means I probably didn't love it, but I remembered it being pretty okay. It's a very pretty game\""]
["05:31,800","05:37,660","\"Yeah, yeah, you know me all my memories of any ration clank I've ever played and I haven't played a lot\""]
["05:37,660","05:43,480","\"So I'm not exactly kind of sure but it's just kind of a generic like platformer. It's not like bad\""]
["05:43,480","05:47,100","\"Oh, you're gonna get killed for saying that people are gonna kill you absolutely\""]
["05:47,100","05:49,960","\"What's I mean, what's not generic about it?\""]
["05:49,960","05:53,840","\"I think it's just like and people grew up with it, but it is it is good\""]
["05:53,840","06:00,380","\"It's I I do like a lot of the things in it. So you can't say anything slightly negative about video game\""]
["06:00,380","06:09,200","\"I know. We are going to take your bell end and hammer it. Don't worry. He's getting his bell end hammered to the table for that.\""]
["06:09,200","06:16,580","\"I guess I was just more of a Jack and Dexter guy. Yeah, I was too, but I still do think Ratchet and Clank is real cool.\""]
["06:16,580","06:21,740","\"I said something along the lines of I tried playing Earthbound and couldn't get into it and I got the most angry\""]
["06:21,740","06:24,420","\"Like Twitter DMs I've ever seen in my life. Oh, yeah\""]
["06:24,420","06:29,380","\"No, you do not want to try it with those people in their crappy game. That's shit\""]
["06:29,380","06:36,980","\"No, everything I've heard is that it's a great game, but like I feel like if you've\""]
["06:36,980","06:41,740","\"played through it before, you'd understand why someone be turned off by the early game\""]
["06:41,740","06:43,740","\"like grindy JRPG stuff.\""]
["06:43,740","06:45,740","\"I didn't even say anything bad.\""]
["06:45,740","06:47,700","\"I just said I couldn't get into it.\""]
["06:47,700","06:50,140","\"That's enough to piss people off horrendously.\""]
["06:50,140","06:51,540","\"I couldn't get into it either.\""]
["06:51,540","06:53,660","\"I mean, I am going down on the ship together.\""]
["06:53,660","06:58,660","\"Yeah, I had a similar experience when we were talking about Xenoblade the other day.\""]
["06:58,660","07:05,380","\"I don't know I like these guys on Twitter sending me like cutscenes being like just this seemed like a bad game to you\""]
["07:05,380","07:07,380","\"And I'm just like yeah\""]
["07:07,380","07:16,200","\"I didn't even say anything. I don't think it's a bad game. I said I could get into it popular gaming pinions only plays a dish\""]

["31:24,580","31:28,260","\"But this game has parts where you move really really fast\""]

["34:19,880","34:27,280","\"Really? I mean we definitely didn't at the time. That's that's what it definitely made it funny\""]
["34:27,280","34:33,780","\"Honestly, I kind of like that's pretty much the only reason to play it is to like fucking laugh at the glitches\""]
["34:33,780","34:39,480","\"I'm sure it's still got a zillion of them, but also like not everything wrong with that game was a glitch which is\""]

["34:50,760","34:57,200","\"It's insane. Yeah on what grounds though on the grounds you really get to sue somebody for not\""]

["35:02,160","35:08,720","\"Like from their perspective. They could be like you could have fucking worked on it more\""]

["35:14,240","35:15,560","\"I\""]
["35:15,560","35:21,260","\"Think that it has something to do with like the PlayStation store like the game was in such a bad state\""]

["43:09,540","43:16,100","\"You know the way the Michael Bay movies are really bad. Yeah, there's like one really good scene in each movie like in the first movie\""]
["43:16,100","43:21,460","\"It's when they're like sliding down a snowy mountain and it's like this amazing action set piece. It's just actually good and\""]
["43:21,460","43:25,880","\"Then I remember I saw the trailer for the second movie and it looks so fun\""]
["43:25,880","43:30,420","\"And then all of the fun parts were just using the trailer and there was all this boring filler in between\""]

["43:33,160","43:39,960","\"I'm gonna I'm gonna since we're starting off with making enemies. I'm gonna go out on a on another like enemy making binge\""]
["43:39,960","43:46,000","\"I think that like as far as like the franchises you should give someone like Michael Bay\""]
["43:46,000","43:51,880","\"Big talking turtles with swords and fucking cars that turn into robots\""]
["43:52,280","43:57,100","\"Are probably like the best you could go with it. It's just sad because\""]
["43:57,100","44:00,180","\"He like those movies suck\""]
["44:00,180","44:05,500","\"But all he needs to do to make them enjoyable is have them be fun action movies from start to finish\""]
["44:05,500","44:10,240","\"But it's there's always this like boring filler with humans that nobody care about yeah, that's true\""]
["44:10,240","44:15,940","\"It's just fucking leave the fucking humans out nobody cares. What's that fucking asshole the shower above no\""]
["44:15,940","44:21,520","\"You know what actually like show above in movies. What's that asshole? He keeps using mark wallberg\""]
["44:22,040","44:26,900","\"Nobody fucking wants to see Mark Wahlberg. I don't think that's true that nobody wants to see\""]
["44:26,900","44:29,700","\"That's probably true\""]
["44:29,700","44:39,760","\"He's just a fucking buff good looking get him off the screen and put the big robot on have you seen a pain in game\""]
["44:39,760","44:44,200","\"No, I think that's actually Michael Bay's best movie really yeah, but Wahlberg's in it\""]
["44:44,200","44:47,280","\"So I don't know if that thing the Transformers one is fine as it is\""]
["44:47,280","44:48,120","\"It's not great\""]
["44:48,120","44:52,120","\"But it's fine and it's entertaining because there's a ton of robots that walk around and talking it\""]
["44:52,120","44:56,720","\"It's it's all I need yeah, but then all the other Transformers movies\""]
["44:56,720","44:59,880","\"Just it's just people standing around talking. It's like I don't fucking care\""]
["44:59,880","45:05,800","\"Yeah, just have robots knock the heads off each other Jeff Goldblum comes in and like chews gum or something\""]

["45:11,800","45:18,120","\"Just make a cartoon. Tomer showed me the old Transformers movie from the 80s and it is fucking amazing\""]
["45:18,120","45:20,360","\"You know that's an accident\""]
["45:20,360","45:26,200","\"But all they needed like they did what they needed they just had a bunch of robots fighting for like two hours straight\""]
["45:26,200","45:30,480","\"It was fucking perfect. That is what I would want out of a transformer movie\""]
["45:30,480","45:36,240","\"Obviously you need story to keep shit going but they have just enough of that. That's fair\""]
["45:36,240","45:39,680","\"Did you cry when octopodomus die? Yes\""]

["46:07,400","46:10,620","\"And he's just like he'll turn into a gun and be like hold me\""]

["01:37:39,380","01:37:46,380","\"I was gonna say the game definitely like yeah, like when you have your full move said it's definitely more fun to move around\""]
["01:37:46,380","01:37:52,180","\"But still the ps2 one was fun from the beginning and you just upgrading it. Oh look at that little guy\""]
