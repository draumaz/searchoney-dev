["18:45,260","18:53,460","\"Every time they see you. No again. It clears the memory for that. So it's still never using more than a single audio track\""]
["18:53,460","19:01,060","\"Maybe they're just using all the memory for the vintage visuals. I think it's supposed to be atmospheric like there's not a lot going on\""]
["19:01,060","19:03,580","\"So it's like tension building. Yeah, it's like a bunch of like\""]
["19:03,580","19:07,520","\"It wouldn't be good Tomar. It would be stupid. I see I\""]
