["00:31,300","00:35,100","\"They're all still shots of 3D models.\""]
["00:35,100","00:40,300","\"Their animators were probably overworked and they were just like, \"\"Fuck you, we're not doing this.\"\"\""]

["00:45,500","00:49,500","\"Yeah, I mean, that's probably it. That's how they chose to focus their priorities.\""]

["05:52,580","05:57,260","\"with this big fat thing now you can fall out take it just drag it into the bush\""]
["05:57,260","06:03,500","\"and no one should find it you stay right here mr. okay I hope I hope the guy he\""]
["06:03,500","06:06,500","\"I figured they would just wake up after a while.\""]
["06:06,500","06:08,500","\"I don't think so.\""]
["06:08,500","06:10,500","\"I can go in this little opening here.\""]

["06:23,500","06:25,500","\"Uh, no one's sad Cassidy.\""]
["06:25,500","06:28,500","\"I'm just drawn to these big physics.\""]

["07:57,240","08:00,920","\"See, that you hit him with a brainstem, I think that would have killed him.\""]
["08:00,920","08:03,560","\"I just really wanted him to fucking get hit.\""]
["08:03,560","08:05,840","\"It said pacify, didn't count it as a kill.\""]
["08:05,840","08:10,360","\"Okay, well, you sure you don't want to drag him a little further into the brush?\""]
["08:10,360","08:12,080","\"Let's just have a little dig first, Tommy.\""]

["09:51,960","09:54,560","\"basically murdered him\""]
