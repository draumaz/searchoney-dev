["05:17,040","05:23,040","\"It's apparently an antique from the Middle Ages that's coated in a concoction of poisons from around the continent.\""]
["05:23,040","05:26,040","\"It's said to have been crafted to kill demons and monsters.\""]

["09:43,420","09:49,020","\"At least they're not quite as strong as like some of the other enemies as far as how many hits they take\""]
["09:49,020","09:52,640","\"Yeah, they die pretty fast. You might even be able to kill him with your knife\""]
["09:52,640","09:55,300","\"I don't know don't quote me on that. Oh, he fell\""]

["10:42,100","10:44,620","\"- You have three masks already.\""]
["10:44,620","10:47,420","\"I feel like I'm kind of a mask curator.\""]
["10:47,420","10:48,580","\"- I need to get out of here.\""]
["10:48,580","10:50,580","\"- The only way out is latter.\""]
["10:50,580","10:52,140","\"I didn't find my baby.\""]
["10:52,140","10:55,460","\"Before she grows up into a child.\""]
["10:55,460","10:57,820","\"- She's gonna fail to imprint on you.\""]
["10:57,820","10:59,660","\"And then the castle will be her dad.\""]
["10:59,660","11:00,940","\"- You're just back at the elevator.\""]
["11:00,940","11:02,900","\"I think that's it for up here, but.\""]
["11:02,900","11:03,740","\"- Oh yeah.\""]
["11:03,740","11:06,460","\"That was pretty good.\""]
["11:07,860","11:13,140","\"Of all the experiences I've had with an elevator, that was one of them.\""]
["11:13,140","11:18,580","\"Jump when you're going down an elevator and you get stuck on the ceiling.\""]
["11:18,580","11:22,340","\"I've done that and you start floating for like 30 floors.\""]
["11:22,340","11:23,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:23,340","11:26,580","\"It's always this weird gravity-defying experience.\""]
["11:26,580","11:29,100","\"Little ago, Tebya.\""]
["11:29,100","11:32,420","\"I think the only place you can go is back into the main area.\""]
["11:32,420","11:34,020","\"Yeah, you could start plugging in heads.\""]
["11:34,020","11:34,940","\"Go visit Duke.\""]

["11:40,940","11:43,380","\"- You've probably killed two of those already.\""]
["11:43,380","11:44,300","\"- Yeah, I think you have.\""]
["11:44,300","11:46,420","\"- You pretty much get a fucker married choice\""]
["11:46,420","11:47,660","\"on the remaining one.\""]

["12:02,660","12:04,660","\"- Get in the elevator, get in the elevator.\""]
["12:04,660","12:06,420","\"I don't know where the hell else you can go.\""]
["12:06,420","12:07,620","\"Don't hurt me, don't hurt me!\""]
["12:07,620","12:11,540","\"- Fuck, Red.\""]

["12:12,740","12:13,640","\"Leave me alone!\""]
["12:13,640","12:17,380","\"- That's so scary.\""]
["12:17,380","12:20,540","\"Uh oh.\""]
["12:20,540","12:22,300","\"(laughing)\""]
["12:22,300","12:24,340","\"- She's got bored in the left.\""]
["12:24,340","12:25,860","\"- Okay.\""]
