["09:41,060","09:45,860","\"Yeah, probably. I mean, they liked Advent Children, and that wasn't even good.\""]
["09:45,860","09:46,860","\"Yeah, I know.\""]
["09:46,860","09:49,660","\"It looked cool, and that was all it took.\""]
["09:49,660","09:56,740","\"Like from crisis core had some cool parts where they like sort of read it reanimated scenes from the original game\""]
["09:56,740","09:59,300","\"Yeah, I love crisis core\""]
["09:59,300","10:02,940","\"Okay, now did we set it yet? No, yeah, we did\""]
["10:02,940","10:13,060","\"Let's get the fuck out of here brute. I really enjoyed crisis core - it's the only game I remember playing on the PSP\""]
["10:13,060","10:17,900","\"Me too and it made Zach so likable in it. He was so fun. Mm-hmm. I\""]
["10:19,180","10:25,340","\"I uh, you know, I'm not gonna say it because I don't know if people have not played Final Fantasy 7, but yeah, Zach's\""]

["10:48,160","10:49,000","\"He's good out of here.\""]
["10:49,000","10:52,060","\"I guess they're more like the band on the Titanic than we thought then.\""]
["10:52,060","10:56,740","\"That's actually why those people couldn't get on the lifeboats.\""]
["10:56,740","10:57,900","\"It wasn't because there wasn't enough.\""]
["10:57,900","11:00,940","\"It's because the band refused to let them pass until they killed them.\""]

["11:36,140","11:41,820","\"When the timer was ticking down I didn't escape on time and right before it got to zero\""]
["11:41,820","11:45,140","\"I jumped up and ran over to the PlayStation and turned it off and started crying\""]
["11:45,700","11:47,700","\"Jeez really\""]
["11:47,700","11:53,660","\"Yeah, I actually had a similar panic moment to that you know banjo kazooie\""]
["11:53,660","11:56,060","\"How would you would you hit exit game?\""]
["11:56,060","12:00,900","\"It just gives you like an ending where like your sister gets turned into a witch and like\""]
["12:00,900","12:09,500","\"Yeah, that happened to me and and not only that I like borrowed the game from a friend\""]
["12:10,660","12:15,620","\"Where you know on a Nintendo 64 cartridge your save data is like on that\""]
["12:15,620","12:22,460","\"So I was like playing on his save and then I hit exit game and it did that and I was like oh my fucking god\""]
["12:22,460","12:24,460","\"I just ruined my friend's game\""]
["12:24,460","12:26,500","\"so what I did was I\""]
["12:26,500","12:31,800","\"Deleted the file and then I lied to him. I said there was a fucking power outage\""]
["12:31,800","12:39,500","\"And and like it was right as I was saving and it deleted the file. I'm sorry like I I didn't want him to know that\""]
["12:39,500","12:45,340","\"Like what what I thought like because I'd never seen something like that before I tried reloading the save to see\""]
["12:45,340","12:51,580","\"No, I just assumed that the game was lost forever. I don't know he wasn't actually that far in it\""]
["12:51,580","12:55,020","\"He was still in like the first zone so he wasn't he didn't really care\""]
["12:55,020","12:58,180","\"But like I felt so fucking bad about it\""]
["12:58,180","13:01,660","\"Not enough to not lie, but you know\""]
["13:01,660","13:05,740","\"I was like six or something I wasn't\""]
["13:07,180","13:15,260","\"It's a six-year-old kind of decision. I remember the first time I watched the Jetsons movie and there's that opening scene where the\""]
["13:15,260","13:21,100","\"Where the little like Ewok things or they're like, I don't even know if you've seen the Jetsons Jetsons the movie\""]
["13:21,100","13:27,300","\"But basically there's like these little Ewok things that like sabotage a machine in the dead of the night\""]
["13:27,300","13:33,720","\"And just like the fact that it was like lit all dark and menacing and there these little like creatures like\""]
["13:34,060","13:37,940","\"Just terrified me for some reason and I'd shut the movie off\""]
["13:37,940","13:43,800","\"Like in the middle of the first seat and never watched the rest of it. There's a cartoon Jetsons movie\""]
["13:43,800","13:47,680","\"Yeah, this is a car this the cartoon Jetsons movie it probably came out in like\""]
