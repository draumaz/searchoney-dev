["08:19,420","08:21,500","\"The racket make him kill.\""]
["08:21,500","08:23,940","\"Why is there been no Pixar movie about an ape yet?\""]
["08:23,940","08:28,940","\"There hasn't been? No. That feels intuitively wrong.\""]
["08:28,940","08:33,940","\"All right, well, we'll be Mr. Disney, Mr. Pixar, and you could be the picture of Christmas.\""]
["08:33,940","08:35,940","\"Okay. Oh, there you are, man.\""]
["08:35,940","08:38,940","\"Oh, Mr. Disney. Have it. Well, have a seat.\""]

["08:51,860","08:52,700","\"Let's hear it.\""]
["08:52,700","08:57,340","\"- Okay, so I've noticed a severe lack\""]
["08:57,340","08:58,820","\"of animated ape movies.\""]
["08:58,820","09:01,140","\"- Right, well, we market tested that,\""]
["09:01,140","09:02,340","\"and the apes don't do well.\""]
["09:02,340","09:03,340","\"- Right, they don't do well.\""]
["09:03,340","09:04,980","\"People get scared of monkeys.\""]
["09:04,980","09:06,500","\"- You think you can come in here and pitch as an ape?\""]
["09:06,500","09:07,820","\"- They think monkeys are gonna come out.\""]
["09:07,820","09:10,000","\"- Well, I don't think it was the apes that didn't do well.\""]
["09:10,000","09:11,060","\"I think it was your audience\""]
["09:11,060","09:13,660","\"and resonate with the messages the apes were conveying.\""]
["09:13,660","09:16,460","\"- What kind of messages do you think an ape would convey\""]
["09:16,460","09:19,280","\"that would compel an audience and what demographic do you think it will look\""]
["09:19,280","09:22,780","\"like pulling apart its asshole and shitting on the camera\""]
["09:22,780","09:25,480","\"right i can see that doing well with that jim z\""]
["09:25,480","09:29,220","\"maybe some of the uh... the older generations but i'm curious that we've\""]
["09:29,220","09:32,860","\"got a gap with millennials and the idea is it's going to prolapse right\""]
["09:32,860","09:33,620","\"because the big\""]
["09:33,620","09:36,860","\"uh... red prolapse well they're already kind of prolapse but yeah right\""]
["09:36,860","09:38,340","\"but for the prolapses\""]
["09:38,340","09:42,060","\"yet for the prolapses the cameras zoomed in on the very tip of the prolapse\""]
["09:42,060","09:44,940","\"does he do it does he do they say you know we're we're doing it picks up\""]
["09:44,940","09:49,460","\"Pete's sake. Yeah, he uses his hands on his chest as percussive instruments. So it's like\""]
["09:49,460","09:52,340","\"And what's the first song about?\""]
["09:52,340","09:57,900","\"Pretty much is running around in leaves with your prolapse\""]

["10:08,140","10:11,220","\"It's gonna be our next it's gonna be our next\""]
["10:11,220","10:25,060","\"Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry. No, no, no. Let's keep your next big hit. Yeah, no, I was thinking\""]
["10:25,060","10:31,620","\"about probably going with like Time Warner if you guys didn't want it. Well, it looks\""]
["10:31,620","10:36,300","\"like an A-stee. So, if we have to probably have to be musical number, who's the villain?\""]
["10:36,300","10:39,420","\"Who are we rooting against? Pretty much as white people.\""]
["10:39,420","10:44,380","\"Okay, that does well. Yeah, and the well why why is this chip against white people?\""]
["10:44,380","10:45,580","\"Are they the enemy?\""]
["10:45,580","10:52,580","\"Well, the white people are against everybody so do you think we could include maybe one white person that is pro prolapse\""]
