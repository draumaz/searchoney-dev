["00:07,740","00:11,600","\"I bet seeing like fast runs of these stages are really satisfying\""]
["00:11,600","00:17,340","\"Oh god I bet like once you've memorized the layout and you know exactly how to navigate them do like a speedrun\""]
["00:17,340","00:25,760","\"I mean, that's the satisfying elements. What has this been? I was hoping he was gonna be flattened on the bottom. Oh, that was kind of harsh\""]
["00:26,800","00:30,240","\"Has this been out for long enough for there to be speedruns? Oh, I'm sure yeah\""]
["00:30,240","00:32,580","\"Okay\""]
["00:32,580","00:37,920","\"Didn't see that oopsie. Tisk Tisk. That was kind of my bad. They're your run run run\""]
["00:37,920","00:41,680","\"Holy it's a scary sound\""]
["00:41,680","00:46,800","\"Do you like that Sega Genesis audio\""]
["00:46,800","00:53,000","\"Sound fonts and shit I would assume I think that's a direct sound effect that they even used\""]
["00:53,800","01:01,400","\"Uh, I always was a fan though. I like uh, I forget the name of the chip the Yamaha one that the the Genesis uses. I always like the\""]
["01:01,400","01:02,200","\"Oh, I like that.\""]

["01:15,600","01:17,000","\"Okay. Okay. Okay.\""]
["01:17,000","01:20,000","\"At least the rings are really good about guiding where you need to go.\""]
["01:20,000","01:22,000","\"I kind of want to see what the 3D models look like.\""]
["01:22,000","01:23,600","\"- Yeah, go now, can you do it?\""]
["01:23,600","01:25,800","\"- No, you can, I'm on the fly.\""]
["01:25,800","01:26,800","\"- On the fly.\""]
["01:26,800","01:28,320","\"I'm so happy they did that.\""]
["01:28,320","01:29,160","\"- Really?\""]
["01:29,160","01:30,000","\"- You don't see that too often.\""]
["01:30,000","01:30,840","\"- Oh, so where?\""]
["01:30,840","01:32,160","\"- It's under video options.\""]
["01:32,160","01:33,680","\"- Oh.\""]
["01:33,680","01:35,240","\"- Down.\""]
["01:35,240","01:36,440","\"- At least it should be.\""]
["01:36,440","01:38,480","\"I remember, oh, OpenGL options.\""]
["01:38,480","01:39,640","\"Yep.\""]
["01:39,640","01:40,480","\"And then.\""]
["01:40,480","01:41,320","\"- Wow.\""]
["01:41,320","01:42,160","\"- There you go.\""]
["01:42,160","01:43,000","\"- Wow, look at that.\""]
["01:43,000","01:44,360","\"- Oh, he's adorable.\""]
["01:44,360","01:46,280","\"- Yeah, that's a nice low-poly model.\""]
["01:46,280","01:47,280","\"- Yeah, I wanna play him.\""]
["01:47,280","01:48,800","\"- I wanna play him with poly too.\""]
["01:48,800","01:50,400","\"- I wanna hug him and pierce my eye.\""]
["01:50,400","01:54,400","\"I can pretend this was the Sega Saturn Sonic we never got.\""]
["01:54,400","01:55,400","\"Let me out of here.\""]
["01:55,400","01:57,400","\"Oh God, let me out of here.\""]
["01:57,400","01:58,400","\"Not allowed.\""]
["01:58,400","02:00,080","\"Oh, okay, we're good.\""]
["02:00,080","02:03,400","\"I like seeing this character rendered low poly.\""]
["02:03,400","02:04,400","\"Because it's to be pointy.\""]
["02:04,400","02:06,400","\"It's almost like he was meant for it.\""]
["02:06,400","02:07,400","\"Holy shit.\""]
["02:07,400","02:09,400","\"He never really got to do it.\""]
["02:09,400","02:10,400","\"I know.\""]
["02:10,400","02:11,800","\"There was Sonic of the Fighters.\""]
["02:11,800","02:13,280","\"There was Sonic Jam.\""]
["02:13,280","02:15,760","\"I feel like those were two of the only times I could.\""]
["02:15,760","02:16,760","\"You know what?\""]
["02:16,760","02:19,400","\"Sonic 3D Blast also had a 3D.\""]
["02:19,400","02:23,040","\"Okay, that was weird why I didn't bonus stage only on the Saturn\""]
["02:23,040","02:24,560","\"Why didn't it put you where you needed to go?\""]
["02:24,560","02:29,080","\"Those are the only times I can really think of I guess Sonic are there's the obvious one\""]
["02:29,080","02:31,080","\"I wonder if maybe he can do a butt bounce\""]
["02:31,080","02:35,240","\"Because it seems like that's the only way to stop your momentum or maybe I just got it\""]
["02:35,240","02:38,820","\"You got to do it yourself all look even the enemies are 3d now\""]
["02:38,820","02:44,200","\"So am I supposed to go this way? Yeah, everything that was 2d now becomes 3d amazing\""]
["02:44,880","02:49,600","\"Well, fuck it's neat. They have that as a feature. I really wasn't expecting it\""]
["02:49,600","02:53,300","\"I love how the 2d looks though all the effort when I do it\""]
["02:53,300","02:55,660","\"That's definitely the one I would prefer but this still looks really good\""]
["02:55,660","02:59,800","\"And I get wanting this because at least then you have a better sense of what direction you're facing\""]
["02:59,800","03:04,840","\"You're gonna do it with the with doom and how it works. You only can face eight different directions\""]
["03:04,840","03:06,920","\"So how do they put a 3d model in doom?\""]
["03:06,920","03:13,120","\"Well, it's not just doom. It's a modified version of doom. Oh, so this is under the open GL menu\""]
["03:13,440","03:18,380","\"So it's rendering differently. I don't know what any of those words mean, but that sure sounds impressive\""]
["03:18,380","03:21,940","\"That's somebody fancy words for sound it\""]
["03:21,940","03:29,360","\"So it doesn't know what any of that means I'm doing it. I'm progressing. He's just a little tiny blue. I'm a spin mouse\""]
["03:29,360","03:31,360","\"I'm hungry\""]
["03:31,360","03:33,420","\"an horny\""]
["03:33,420","03:35,880","\"Good combination the perfect animal really\""]
["03:35,880","03:42,220","\"That's animals. All right. Hey, here's my impression of an animal. Do I'm hungry and horny\""]
["03:42,920","03:44,920","\"You sell like an animal\""]
["03:44,920","03:53,520","\"Okay, what was that about there's rings really you got them very good I\""]
["03:53,520","03:56,640","\"Like even a checkpoint 3d\""]
["03:56,640","04:02,440","\"This is a long fucking level it is I remember it being a long one\""]
["04:02,440","04:04,440","\"Yeah\""]
["04:04,440","04:09,320","\"But you know what that means this game is jam-packed full content. How long is it?\""]
["04:10,040","04:16,600","\"I forget how many stages they have now when I last played it. It was only like five or something. It's gone up a lot\""]
["04:16,600","04:24,160","\"Yeah, I mean I know I don't know how many secrets there are too because there were secret maps in this too\""]
["04:24,160","04:26,960","\"There were lots of a lot of things\""]
["04:26,960","04:33,760","\"Oh, just neat. I remember they had like a Christmas area that you could find as a secret. Can you see say it?\""]
["04:33,760","04:36,560","\"No, Tails died\""]
["04:36,560","04:39,800","\"In real life\""]
["04:39,800","04:40,640","\"AHHHHH!\""]
["04:40,640","04:41,800","\"You got trained.\""]
["04:41,800","04:43,760","\"That was a happy accident.\""]
["04:43,760","04:46,920","\"Wow.\""]
["04:46,920","04:49,280","\"Did you see him bouncing on the edge back there?\""]
["04:49,280","04:49,780","\"My dad.\""]
["04:49,780","04:50,280","\"It was cute.\""]
["04:50,280","04:51,600","\"They gave him a little animation.\""]
["04:51,600","04:53,520","\"I would have been so happy with this game as a character.\""]
["04:53,520","04:54,520","\"There it is.\""]
["04:54,520","04:55,920","\"I know, right?\""]
["04:55,920","04:57,600","\"I would have played the heck out of it.\""]
["04:57,600","05:01,240","\"I mean, to be fair, I did play the original build a lot.\""]
["05:01,240","05:02,320","\"The one that I had at the time.\""]
["05:02,320","05:03,200","\"I shouldn't say original.\""]
["05:03,200","05:04,360","\"There was no original.\""]
["05:04,360","05:06,280","\"I guess it was the first build, but...\""]
["05:06,280","05:08,000","\"Look who it is.\""]
["05:08,000","05:09,560","\"I played this a lot.\""]
