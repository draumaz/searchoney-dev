["35:14,100","35:19,580","\"I'm before you say this. Yeah. Yeah, Resident Evil 7 is like the problem I would have with it\""]
["35:19,580","35:23,740","\"It's probably a fun VR experience because it's personal in that regard it is but\""]
["35:23,740","35:26,820","\"Once you see a single thing of it\""]
["35:26,820","35:30,460","\"You know exactly what it's gonna be forever because it's heavily set\""]
["35:30,460","35:38,160","\"Yeah, there's no exploration. I feel like it's all very like the exploration is like very minor rooms and minor lines of following\""]
["35:38,160","35:40,380","\"That's what I feel like with the games\""]
["35:40,380","35:48,420","\"Well, I don't know that there's just to me. I'm like I'm one of the people who prefers the tank controls and the set cameras\""]
["35:48,420","35:52,500","\"I just think they're I just think it's a cool thing. I don't know. I never unique. Yeah\""]
["35:52,500","35:58,840","\"Resident Evil one for GameCube was like really fun. Yeah, like even when it's tank controls. It looked really nice, too\""]
["35:58,860","36:01,240","\"Like I never thought it got dated like\""]
["36:01,240","36:06,520","\"Like other people do I just don't think they've explored it in quite a long time\""]
["36:06,520","36:08,700","\"Like once the last time you played a game with 10 controls\""]
["36:08,700","36:13,580","\"I mean they're never gonna do it again because the majority of people actually really hate like I was encased in the same\""]
["36:13,580","36:16,400","\"But I like it that I think Harrison Ford was encased\""]
["36:16,400","36:20,220","\"I think everything up to four is really good five is a fun game\""]
["36:20,220","36:28,660","\"But like the it's a bad Resident Evil game and then six is trash and seven's a good return to form six is like just it's an action movie\""]
["36:28,660","36:36,560","\"It's really bad. Did you ever played six? Yeah, it is so boring. Holy fuck you want to talk about set pieces and I had a fun time with it\""]
["36:36,560","36:40,300","\"But it was only specifically because I played it with a friend who's the funnest person ever\""]
["36:40,300","36:46,000","\"Yeah, it's true, but it's not a zombie game. It's like an action game. It was silly like the way the zombies ran around in that game\""]
["36:46,000","36:51,260","\"It was too silly. I just you can't take it seriously if you're playing Resident Evil 6\""]
["36:51,260","36:54,380","\"You won't be scared you'll be like, okay\""]
["36:54,380","36:57,580","\"I just do like a backflip and just like serial kicked like three of them\""]
["36:58,020","37:03,860","\"Into the wall. Well, I just think that like seven kind of brought things back to where things are actually like they're focusing on horror again\""]
["37:03,860","37:06,660","\"And it was an interesting thing to do first person\""]
["37:06,660","37:12,080","\"But I feel like they still went kind of strict with I really fucking hated the linearity of it\""]
["37:12,080","37:16,380","\"I didn't like the main character. He had no personality and I thought the girl\""]
["37:16,380","37:18,220","\"He was trying to get back was annoying and gross\""]
["37:18,220","37:23,460","\"I honestly couldn't bring myself to beatix. I kind of got bored of it part way through but like\""]
["37:23,460","37:27,980","\"Oh God, she was so I think there's an evil - there's evil - like remaking\""]
["37:27,980","37:32,260","\"Even though it's definitely nowhere near as good as the original like Resident Evil 2. It's a good\""]
["37:32,260","37:36,380","\"I hope they make more Resident Evil games like the Resident Evil 2. Yeah, put his new games\""]
["37:36,380","37:42,100","\"Yeah, I remember when you see her in the opening on the laptop when she's on the boat and she already looks like a fucking rotting corpse\""]
