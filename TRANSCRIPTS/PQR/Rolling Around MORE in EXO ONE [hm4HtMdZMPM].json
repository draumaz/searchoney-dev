["05:44,320","05:48,320","\"What the fuck is wrong with them\""]

["06:36,480","06:39,080","\"I bet that's the story. I should have said that though\""]
["06:39,080","06:44,720","\"Why are we being so cruel? I wonder how much fucking work went into this game like\""]
["06:44,720","06:50,920","\"So so when we played it. Yeah, that was like two years ago, right? Was it really maybe it couldn't have been\""]
["06:50,920","06:52,920","\"I was like one it was like well\""]
["06:52,920","06:53,820","\"It was easily here\""]
["06:53,820","06:58,300","\"There's a glitch somewhere to hear that if you go on top of saliva Briana who comes out grabbed you a little or\""]
["06:58,920","07:04,460","\"Pause you in that's her missile defense system on the moon. Yeah, holy shit\""]
["07:04,460","07:10,860","\"But no, yeah, I think we played this like a year ago. I thought it was longer, but I could be wrong\""]
["07:10,860","07:14,460","\"I don't know. Oh my god. It's boy. You like it's a very beautiful game\""]
["07:14,460","07:20,900","\"But honestly, there's not much going on yet. That's what I mean is like this game was a complete or seemed like it\""]
["07:20,900","07:23,480","\"It's really nice to look it, but I hope it gets more complicated\""]
["07:23,480","07:28,640","\"See this is another thing where it's like they did the thing where as long as it's fun to control it\""]
["07:28,640","07:32,320","\"You can play it for as long as you fucking want. It's good. Yeah, basically good\""]
["07:32,320","07:35,800","\"But you'd hope that they'd fulfill the other side and actually make it like\""]
["07:35,800","07:41,980","\"You populate the world to make the upgrades worth it like what can you upgrade into they should just they should just poke big\""]
["07:41,980","07:43,980","\"Woolly mammoth lile creatures walking around\""]
["07:43,980","07:51,440","\"You could upgrade it to like digging and stuff to yeah down. Oh, that would be cool. Yeah, I was kind of hoping that give you machine gun\""]
["07:51,440","07:54,740","\"Deep in the water. Yeah, you could really if you just push to give a little bit further\""]
["07:54,740","08:00,480","\"But why we don't know. Maybe it does do that. Yeah, no that that was a that was kind of what I was getting at was\""]
["08:00,480","08:04,780","\"I wonder like how much how much actual content is here?\""]
["08:04,780","08:08,440","\"Dude that computer's gonna explode. Yeah, we should turn it off\""]
["08:08,440","08:11,480","\"Maybe see how it falls see much more than my walking push\""]
["08:11,480","08:16,940","\"Dude go to yeah, we gotta we gotta see this\""]
["08:16,940","08:20,940","\"Scary that actually is oh my god\""]

["08:34,900","08:35,900","\"Uh...\""]
["08:35,900","08:38,560","\"No, I don't think so.\""]
["08:38,560","08:41,060","\"Dude, when you go deep in the water, like, that is scary.\""]
["08:41,060","08:43,060","\"That is scary. What is it doing?\""]
["08:43,060","08:45,060","\"It's flashy. Who just at you?\""]
["08:45,060","08:47,060","\"Let's have a little- let's have a rest.\""]

["08:54,220","08:56,100","\"There you go\""]
["08:56,100","08:58,100","\"What the fuck?\""]
["08:58,100","09:00,100","\"Holy shit was it supposed to do that?\""]
["09:00,100","09:07,540","\"I guess so. I guess so. I think. Holy. Holy. Shit dude. There's like a meteor shower happening. What happened?\""]
["09:07,540","09:09,700","\"How did you go? How'd you go up this high?\""]
["09:09,700","09:16,300","\"Wow, yeah, that's killer. There's me the artist. Go inside the cloud\""]
["09:16,300","09:24,720","\"Oh wow that rainy is so cool real looks fucking real real\""]
["09:24,720","09:30,740","\"That this game is crazy dude. This is what no man's guy should have been. Yeah. I was just thinking that\""]
["09:30,740","09:33,660","\"whoo\""]
["09:33,660","09:36,120","\"So where am I going huh?\""]
["09:36,120","09:40,560","\"Can you not see the light in the distance? Maybe I am supposed to be under the water I\""]
["09:40,560","09:42,720","\"Somehow doubt that\""]
["09:42,720","09:46,460","\"Considering it shoots you out of the water and starts glitching out when you hit the bottom\""]
["09:46,460","09:52,060","\"No, I think it was that he stopped and then just waited. Yeah, I don't know if I was supposed to do that\""]
["09:52,060","09:54,140","\"I got a better deal to get I think that's a way for you to get out\""]
["09:54,140","10:01,500","\"It was like I hit that and then it didn't know what to do because we're heading straight up seems like that was intentional\""]
["10:01,500","10:03,500","\"What it did do to you do it again look\""]
["10:03,500","10:06,380","\"There you go see look yeah, it does\""]
["10:07,900","10:08,900","\"That's a good one.\""]
["10:08,900","10:11,280","\"That does not seem right.\""]
["10:11,280","10:12,280","\"It did it twice though.\""]
["10:12,280","10:16,320","\"Yeah, look, I think that is just for the effect of it because we're going insanely fast.\""]
["10:16,320","10:19,820","\"Okay, so there's the light.\""]
["10:19,820","10:25,980","\"Maybe try doing that, but skip across the water like right before you hit it flat now.\""]
["10:25,980","10:26,980","\"Yeah, okay.\""]
["10:26,980","10:29,900","\"Okay, so we're just going to skip like a skipping stone.\""]
["10:29,900","10:32,580","\"Yeah, that seems like the idea.\""]
["10:32,580","10:36,220","\"Because it doesn't really seem to want you to go under it.\""]
["10:36,220","10:38,220","\"Yeah, it's awesome\""]
["10:38,220","10:42,060","\"That is so clever. Oh, maybe I should jump when I'm hitting the water. Oh\""]
["10:42,060","10:49,000","\"Fucked up. It's really hard. Whoa. What is that or maybe like dip under the water and then like\""]
["10:49,000","10:53,920","\"Then flatten out and let it shoot you out. Oh, we should have a little ball break. Well\""]
["10:53,920","10:57,580","\"Ball break everyone take out your balls\""]
["10:57,580","11:00,940","\"Show us your bows\""]
["11:01,180","11:07,500","\"Take a number two pencils. That's what doctors do is they all have a ball break and they show each other their balls and all\""]
["11:07,500","11:09,500","\"You know hold each other's balls. Oh\""]
["11:09,500","11:14,680","\"At least that that's what my doctor told me. He was like yeah, did you see so little upgrade right here somewhere?\""]
["11:14,680","11:17,020","\"Yeah, it's right there. It's going to a distance. I\""]
["11:17,020","11:24,220","\"Knew you'd like this game Zack. Oh, I love this game. Oh, I love this game. Oh, I love this game. Oh, I love this game\""]

["11:26,460","11:30,220","\"It's like what's real? Oh fucking Christ. That scared me\""]
["11:30,220","11:32,820","\"What's really going on here, Zach?\""]
["11:32,820","11:34,500","\"What do you mean?\""]
["11:34,500","11:40,220","\"Why are you acting like this? What do you mean? You've been this way for a while. It's everyone notices it\""]
["11:40,220","11:44,820","\"What do you mean? Everyone's been talking about it. Dude, you're just not yourself anymore\""]
["11:44,820","11:50,060","\"This isn't the first time we've had a discussion about the Zach problem, you know? What do you mean?\""]
["11:50,060","11:56,780","\"You just are what you used to be. What do you mean? What's in there? What is this shit?\""]
["11:56,780","11:59,620","\"It's a god. It's a piece of gold. It's a fucking god\""]
["11:59,620","12:04,240","\"So what you put gold member on the top of that why does what do games never include gold member?\""]
["12:04,240","12:09,740","\"If this game had gold member for hours three have they made an Austin powers game of they ever take him\""]
["12:09,740","12:14,220","\"It was a gameboy color game like a sad swing at that. You should make a devil would pitch it to like a big\""]
["12:14,220","12:15,540","\"Scumpey\""]
["12:15,540","12:21,300","\"That's how the Ghostbusters game got made is there really yeah, these guys these guys just made it the road devil put it on YouTube\""]
["12:21,300","12:28,480","\"Oh, that's cool. The company recently the game pretty okay. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I didn't play it but from what I know about it\""]

["12:34,080","12:41,040","\"Yeah, it was Harold Davis's dead equates script. That's crazy. That's actually kind of cool\""]
["12:41,040","12:47,720","\"So it really is Ghostbusters 3 but it's just shitty PS2 graphics. It's nuts how like even before Ghostbusters\""]
["12:47,720","12:51,900","\"3 like you know when it was a spec script and everything they were like\""]
