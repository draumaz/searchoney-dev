["06:43,920","06:47,520","\"He goes to the beach like a Quohog it was before that\""]
["06:47,520","06:52,240","\"He was out in the ocean and then to go to the store and Meg wants to fuck the dude\""]

["07:11,120","07:16,120","\"I think you went out of bounds probably. And that was just their solution to that.\""]
["07:16,120","07:20,120","\"If Family Guy was smart, they would have did an open world game in like 2008.\""]
["07:20,120","07:26,120","\"The Simpsons did that. Yeah they did. They did Simpsons Hit and Run and it was actually pretty okay.\""]
["07:26,120","07:30,120","\"You know whoever did the Family Guy game probably got fired because of how bad it was.\""]
["07:30,120","07:33,420","\"The Simpsons hit right now is probably the best Simpsons game, right?\""]
["07:33,420","07:37,360","\"I would say so. Yeah, people still regard it as like beloved and stuff\""]
["07:37,360","07:41,480","\"It's because if you're in it if you're dropped in a television shows world you want to explore the world\""]
["07:41,480","07:46,960","\"Yeah, there was there was a simsons game for the Xbox 360 that I\""]
["07:46,960","07:53,440","\"Think looked looked at least like competent like that it actually does look like the cartoon a little bit\""]
["07:53,440","07:56,060","\"Look at what angry these guys weird 3d thing\""]
["07:56,060","08:00,980","\"But was that just the simpson's movie game? I don't think it was the movie game\""]
["08:00,980","08:04,660","\"It was I think it was just called the Simpsons. I'm pretty sure\""]
["08:04,660","08:08,260","\"I don't know if the game was any good, but I know it looked just got like\""]
["08:08,260","08:12,940","\"Angel is like broken that is fucking hot. Look say the lines that\""]
["08:12,940","08:19,900","\"I just like looking at Peter. I want to look at his face more than anything\""]
["08:19,900","08:24,820","\"But it won't let me it won't let me turn around what if you what if you turn towards the camera?\""]
["08:24,820","08:26,820","\"Do you just walk backwards whoa?\""]

["08:37,680","08:40,580","\"Okay, almost everything\""]
["08:40,580","08:46,540","\"Just when you think you're out starts to pull you back in I want to make a game like this\""]
["08:46,540","08:52,360","\"I wonder where he got these like family guy houses and shit. So I doubt he downloaded them from anywhere. I had to make them\""]
["08:52,360","08:55,080","\"Yeah. Oh yeah, we never talked to Quagmire.\""]
["08:55,080","08:57,880","\"Was that an objective?\""]

["09:54,080","09:59,320","\"That makes you lick apparently. Really? Oh, maybe it was click, but it was just a typo.\""]
["09:59,320","10:01,320","\"Oh, it's a lick to continue.\""]
["10:01,320","10:05,320","\"This is uneronically beautiful with the sunsetting in the lighting in the rain.\""]
["10:05,320","10:08,620","\"Oh, that rat is just the market that says you can get into the car.\""]

["10:32,280","10:36,200","\"Yes, but he's a little bit further down the street. I feel like we're playing witch hunt or something\""]
["10:36,200","10:41,880","\"This guy should should make a full game. There's Adam West\""]
["10:42,960","10:48,300","\"Wait, can you can you talk to him? Do you have to go to his door, too? Whoa? He put his hand on his face\""]
["10:48,300","10:51,720","\"Does that mean there's like a truck noise where you walk up that you killed him?\""]
