["06:12,320","06:15,100","\"So he's raised some like like youth militia\""]
["06:15,100","06:21,660","\"And also it applies that he only dies at like age like truly like age like 17 because he's not even that right\""]
["06:21,660","06:26,260","\"He only lives like three extra years. He basically becomes a new kony if you think about it like\""]
