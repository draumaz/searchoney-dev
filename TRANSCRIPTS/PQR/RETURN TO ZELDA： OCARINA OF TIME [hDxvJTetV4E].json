["08:01,080","08:02,080","\"Yes, Daddy.\""]
["08:02,080","08:05,080","\"Did they change anything about this game for the GameCube version?\""]
["08:05,080","08:09,080","\"Uh, interface, I'm sure it runs different.\""]
["08:09,080","08:10,080","\"Oh.\""]
["08:10,080","08:13,080","\"And yeah, it's different layouts for everything.\""]

["08:14,080","08:16,080","\"Yeah, for like the dungeons they change where things are.\""]
["08:16,080","08:17,080","\"What, really?\""]
["08:17,080","08:19,080","\"Because it's supposed to be like a Master Quest thing.\""]
["08:19,080","08:21,080","\"No, the Master Quest was on the same disc.\""]
["08:21,080","08:23,080","\"Did they have both the original?\""]
["08:23,080","08:24,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:24,080","08:29,880","\"I'm I remember them doing the master quest specifically. I'm sure the original one just has the interface then\""]
["08:29,880","08:35,020","\"I know they also had Majora that got ported to the game cube. Yeah, they were both on the same desk. Yeah\""]
["08:35,020","08:40,020","\"I never played master quest. I wonder why they never did master quest versions of other Zelda games\""]
["08:40,020","08:44,040","\"Didn't that doesn't the original one have one does it? Yeah at the end oh\""]
["08:44,040","08:49,480","\"She tells you try master mode and when you start it up the game just kills you immediately\""]
["08:51,040","08:55,880","\"But what was that disc even given out with because I remember it was like a thing it was the win-waker\""]
["08:55,880","08:59,080","\"Yeah, it was it was a promotional thing to get you to buy the win-waker\""]
["08:59,080","09:03,280","\"Yeah, cuz I remember it and that was the thing was I never ended up actually getting that disc\""]
["09:03,280","09:09,480","\"I always wanted it and I know it goes for a lot doesn't it apparently mine was Europeans are probably not a lot\""]
["09:09,480","09:11,480","\"I wish I still had mine\""]
["09:11,480","09:17,040","\"It's neat being able to play those on the game cube. That's really cool. Special controller that thing is nice\""]
["09:18,040","09:20,040","\"It was bad about it.\""]
["09:20,040","09:21,040","\"Is that it has the worst beep head?\""]
["09:21,040","09:23,040","\"Would you say it's really rad?\""]
["09:23,040","09:26,040","\"Okay, he keeps bringing up the Zelda rap.\""]
["09:26,040","09:28,040","\"Every time I hear the Zelda rap.\""]
["09:28,040","09:30,040","\"I think so. The two nerds on the couch.\""]
["09:30,040","09:32,040","\"Yes, I think of the American commercial.\""]
["09:32,040","09:35,040","\"He's thinking of the Japanese link to the past commercial,\""]
["09:35,040","09:36,040","\"while they're all dancing.\""]
["09:36,040","09:38,040","\"Better to play the American commercial.\""]
["09:38,040","09:40,040","\"Did you see the latest Nintendo newsletter?\""]
["09:40,040","09:42,040","\"Whoa, nice graphics. I'd like to get my hands on that game.\""]
["09:42,040","09:44,040","\"You mean you haven't played it yet?\""]
["09:44,040","09:46,040","\"We can play on one Nintendo Entertainment System.\""]
["09:46,040","09:49,320","\"And it's really rad those creatures from get a pretty bad\""]
["09:49,320","09:53,560","\"Tech techs leavers - but with your help our hero boss\""]
["09:53,560","10:04,000","\"The best one it doesn't it's a whole thing just the worst part\""]
["10:04,000","10:11,440","\"I'll play the other one by comparison and then bump it off screen in favor of the American one\""]
["10:11,440","10:15,000","\"Ding-dong likes that the the bad one annoys me\""]
["10:15,000","10:17,000","\"I\""]
["10:17,000","10:21,680","\"Mean the thing is the other one is probably one of the best commercials I can think of for any game\""]
["10:21,680","10:24,960","\"It's really would have been if I had seen that as a kid. I would have been yeah\""]
["10:24,960","10:28,880","\"I would have been thrilled. Yeah, it would have made me want it right away the Japanese one\""]
["10:28,880","10:31,840","\"Yeah, or they're all dancing the American ones better\""]
["10:31,840","10:35,960","\"It's true because it shows that a nerd and a jock can get together to play Nintendo\""]
["10:35,960","10:43,320","\"Is that how you feel sitting down with us Chris? Yeah, I'm definitely the jock. You're definitely oh, oh you think you're the\""]

["11:28,020","11:29,660","\"- And the Wii had the one and two buttons too.\""]
["11:29,660","11:32,220","\"- I guess because remote,\""]
["11:32,220","11:37,220","\"but as if it's like volume control on a TV remote,\""]
["11:37,580","11:38,580","\"It's very odd.\""]
["11:38,580","11:42,580","\"The Wii Remote wanted to emulate, like, a TV remote.\""]
["11:42,580","11:43,580","\"I mean, yeah.\""]
["11:43,580","11:46,980","\"I kind of like some things about the Wii Remote looking back on it too.\""]
["11:46,980","11:48,980","\"I did like that, the Nunchuck and everything.\""]
["11:48,980","11:49,980","\"My favorite part is this...\""]
["11:49,980","11:52,980","\"You can kind of just recline into any position while playing a game.\""]

["14:17,860","14:19,540","\"That should be the Zelda-pedia.\""]

["14:25,780","14:28,180","\"What, how did they miss that opportunity?\""]
["14:28,180","14:30,680","\"How do you un-fucking look at things in this game?\""]
["14:30,680","14:32,780","\"[laughter]\""]
["14:32,780","14:35,780","\"How do you look at wings from all of these bizarre things?\""]

["14:47,580","14:49,780","\"He keeps peeking through his fingers.\""]
["14:49,780","14:52,080","\"You can make that.\""]
["14:52,080","14:57,980","\"By the way, what a interesting idea that you walk over a ledge to hop.\""]
["14:57,980","14:59,980","\"It's a neat one, I like it.\""]
["14:59,980","15:03,480","\"It's kind of crazy how they adapt Zelda into a 3D format.\""]
["15:03,480","15:06,480","\"Okay, just because I don't know why.\""]
["15:06,480","15:07,680","\"I don't want to learn.\""]
["15:07,680","15:09,180","\"Why is that a good thing?\""]

["15:09,680","15:10,480","\"The hopping?\""]
["15:10,480","15:10,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["15:10,980","15:12,480","\"Uh...\""]
["15:12,480","15:15,480","\"Just because it means you don't have to use a button for it.\""]
["15:15,480","15:16,980","\"You don't have to dedicate a whole...\""]
["15:16,980","15:18,480","\"And you can design around it too.\""]
["15:18,480","15:21,480","\"You can see a gap like that and figure out how you're supposed to like,\""]
["15:21,480","15:23,480","\"just walk forward and keep going.\""]
["15:23,480","15:25,480","\"But isn't it like the easiest thing possible?\""]
["15:25,480","15:27,880","\"Yeah, this game's pretty easy, I would say.\""]
["15:27,880","15:29,880","\"So why wouldn't you just put a jump button in?\""]
["15:29,880","15:36,980","\"Because you want to conserve buttons forever other things fair enough. It's also that it's not like this is a platformer\""]
["15:36,980","15:42,240","\"Yeah, it's not the point. Yeah, you do have technically jumps you can do you have a backflip\""]
["15:42,240","15:43,920","\"You have the side jump true\""]
["15:43,920","15:48,520","\"But it's also just little hops because they're kind of based around the idea of using them in combat\""]
["15:48,520","15:54,160","\"Oh, this is the famous Murray or me and Mona smokes weed room remember I have no clue what you're talking about\""]
["15:54,520","15:59,880","\"Last summer in this room we made fun of me and Moto and we oh I forgot what such a funny bit\""]

["16:35,440","16:37,440","\"It is kind of an eyesore.\""]
