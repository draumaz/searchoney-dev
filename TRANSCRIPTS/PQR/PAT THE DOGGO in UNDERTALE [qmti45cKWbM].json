["05:07,440","05:12,080","\"These guys do act like brothers, you know there's a switch on the trunk of this tree. Oh really?\""]
["05:12,080","05:18,960","\"You cheated. You cheated. I didn't know that was there. I didn't. I just fell into that tree.\""]
["05:18,960","05:28,000","\"Human? How do I say this? You were taking a long time to arrive, so I decided to improve this puzzle\""]
["05:28,000","05:33,680","\"by arranging the snow to look more like my face. Unfortunately, the snow froze to the ground.\""]
["05:33,680","05:39,680","\"Now the solution is different. And as usual, lazy brothers nowhere around.\""]
["05:40,560","05:42,560","\"I suppose what I am saying is,\""]
["05:42,560","05:44,560","\"\"\"But he's not human!\"\"\""]

["05:48,560","05:49,560","\"Hell yeah!\""]
["05:49,560","05:51,560","\"Then we can both proceed!\""]
["05:51,560","05:54,560","\"Meanwhile, feel free to try the puzzle for yourself.\""]
["05:54,560","05:57,560","\"I'll try not to give away the answer.\""]
["05:57,560","05:58,560","\"Wait, let's see, look at it.\""]
["05:58,560","05:59,560","\"I was gonna say...\""]
["05:59,560","06:01,560","\"Oh, I love these kinds of puzzles.\""]
["06:01,560","06:03,560","\"Uh, wait, what the fuck?\""]
["06:03,560","06:04,560","\"Whoa!\""]
["06:04,560","06:08,560","\"I guess once you pass over it twice, you're just screwed.\""]
["06:08,560","06:15,040","\"Oh, oh, I guess I have to press this to reset it. I know what to do. I know what to do. Really? Yeah, okay\""]
["06:15,040","06:17,040","\"Oh, okay. I think I do too\""]
["06:17,040","06:19,040","\"Okay, okay, okay, okay go down\""]

["06:23,040","06:27,240","\"Fuck\""]
["06:27,240","06:32,920","\"No, you got it. Yeah, they go down. Yeah, and then left and then up to that one. I think we can just\""]
["06:32,920","06:35,920","\"Do that yeah\""]
["06:37,880","06:41,960","\"You solved it and you did it all without my help\""]
["06:41,960","06:45,120","\"Incredible I'm impressed\""]
["06:45,120","06:48,320","\"You must care about puzzles like I do\""]
["06:48,320","06:54,940","\"Well, I'm sure you love the next puzzle then it might even be too easy for you\""]
["06:54,940","06:59,120","\"-\""]
["06:59,120","07:01,640","\"He walks like a bitch. Do we have to do that?\""]
["07:02,600","07:07,840","\"Yeah, I don't know what the puzzle and the switch in the tree even did good job on solver gets so quickly\""]
["07:07,840","07:10,840","\"You didn't even need my help\""]
["07:10,840","07:15,560","\"Which is great because I love doing absolutely nothing. Hey\""]
["07:15,560","07:18,520","\"It's the human\""]
["07:18,520","07:23,080","\"You're gonna love this puzzle. It was made by the great dr. Elfus\""]
["07:23,080","07:25,920","\"You see these tiles\""]
["07:25,920","07:30,260","\"Once I throw this switch, they will begin to change color\""]
["07:30,840","07:35,840","\"Each color has a different function. Red tiles are impassable.\""]
["07:35,840","07:40,840","\"You cannot walk on them. Yellow tiles are electric.\""]
["07:40,840","07:45,840","\"They will electrocute you. Green tiles are alarm tiles.\""]
["07:45,840","07:51,840","\"If you step on them, you will have to fight a monster. Orange tiles are orange scented.\""]
["07:51,840","07:55,840","\"They will make you smell delicious. Blue tiles are water tiles.\""]
["07:55,840","07:59,840","\"Swim through if you like, but if you smell like oranges,\""]
["07:59,840","08:07,840","\"The piranhas will bite you. Also if a blue tile is next to a yellow tile, the water will also zap you.\""]
["08:07,840","08:15,840","\"Purple tiles are slippery. You will slide the next tile. However, the slippery soap smells like lemons.\""]
["08:15,840","08:22,840","\"Which piranhas do not like. Purple and blue are okay. Finally, pink tiles. They don't do anything.\""]
["08:22,840","08:26,840","\"Step on the more you like. How is that? Understand?\""]
["08:26,840","08:33,220","\"Yeah, understand the explanation course great, and there's one last thing\""]
["08:33,220","08:35,800","\"This puzzle is\""]
["08:35,800","08:43,260","\"Entirely random when I pull this switch it will make a puzzle that has never been seen before\""]
["08:43,260","08:46,000","\"Not even I will know the solution\""]
["08:46,000","08:48,640","\"Yeah, get ready\""]
["08:48,640","08:51,680","\"All our members is proud us\""]

["09:16,960","09:19,800","\"It wasn't too bad for my brother\""]
["09:19,800","09:23,400","\"Since he has started cooking lessons. He's been improving a lot\""]
["09:23,400","09:26,420","\"But, aww, I bet if he keeps it up next,\""]
["09:26,420","09:28,460","\"you're hell even make something edible?\""]
