["01:35,120","01:36,400","\"I made it as my first player.\""]
["01:36,400","01:38,720","\"Just your average difficulty.\""]
["01:38,720","01:41,440","\"I'm just your average everyday guy,\""]

["05:59,280","06:00,280","\"Keep it down.\""]

["06:04,080","06:05,380","\"Okay, what's her problem?\""]
["06:05,380","06:08,040","\"Why did she do that?\""]
["06:08,040","06:09,040","\"Is she a vampire?\""]
["06:09,040","06:10,640","\"She doesn't show up in the mirror.\""]
["06:10,640","06:11,640","\"Yeah, what's up?\""]
["06:11,640","06:12,640","\"Why is that mirror coming?\""]
["06:12,640","06:14,960","\"Clearly because they couldn't put a good reflection in it.\""]
["06:14,960","06:15,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:15,960","06:17,960","\"That's so fucked.\""]

["06:21,460","06:22,460","\"Wait a second.\""]
["06:22,460","06:24,200","\"This game just loops in on itself.\""]
["06:24,200","06:26,040","\"This is where you started.\""]
["06:26,040","06:27,840","\"This is the game loop, really?\""]
["06:27,840","06:29,840","\"So this is the core gameplay loop.\""]
["06:29,840","06:30,840","\"It's just a little bit--\""]
["06:30,840","06:32,360","\"They just ripped off PT.\""]

["06:35,680","06:36,180","\"OK.\""]
["06:36,180","06:37,360","\"This is pretty good.\""]
["06:37,360","06:39,440","\"I always like when they put stuff like this in games.\""]
["06:39,440","06:41,080","\"Actually, I don't know if this is going anywhere.\""]
["06:41,080","06:46,920","\"But like I like we should watch this for at least another 10 15. Oh wait. No, there's conflict now\""]
["06:46,920","06:54,840","\"I like when they put fake TV channels and games like the grand theft auto like yeah TV shows and shit like that\""]
["06:54,840","07:00,200","\"I don't want to play with the baby no more. Hurry up and put rose to sleep. Sorry, baby\""]
["07:00,200","07:04,280","\"Sorry, baby. You're not fun anymore. She's so pushy\""]
["07:04,280","07:06,200","\"Hmm\""]
["07:06,200","07:08,600","\"Maybe you should push her down to some stairs\""]
["07:10,680","07:15,200","\"Are you supposed to put in that cradle or fuck come on now\""]
["07:15,200","07:19,480","\"Tap tap to your mom\""]
["07:19,480","07:23,960","\"It's like I said to your mom tap tap tap shut up\""]

["07:43,840","07:47,140","\"I've seen pictures of him, but like yeah, I think the game ever shows him.\""]
["07:47,140","07:52,340","\"Yeah, I feel like people made a big deal about how this game never really shows you even so much.\""]
["07:52,340","07:54,340","\"So he's like a Gordon Foreman.\""]
["07:54,340","07:57,840","\"But I feel like they did show him a bunch in the last game.\""]
["07:57,840","07:59,840","\"[Giggles]\""]
["07:59,840","08:03,840","\"Now feed it into it like a meat grinder.\""]
["08:03,840","08:04,840","\"[Laughs]\""]
["08:04,840","08:05,840","\"I don't want to do it.\""]
["08:05,840","08:07,340","\"Oh, this is the baby room for sure.\""]
["08:07,340","08:08,840","\"Yeah, just a bad baby.\""]
["08:08,840","08:10,040","\"Just dump it in the box.\""]
["08:10,040","08:12,920","\"- Trying to do a deep claim before Rose starts walking around.\""]
["08:12,920","08:15,200","\"- Is this gonna be the baby room?\""]
["08:15,200","08:16,880","\"This is your dust room.\""]
["08:16,880","08:17,880","\"- This is the dust room.\""]
["08:17,880","08:19,760","\"This is referring to Resident Evil 7,\""]
