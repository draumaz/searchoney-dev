["09:01,000","09:05,580","\"It's just and it's cuz someone points up and says look yeah, they draw\""]

["10:07,900","10:11,660","\"But they're in the real world. I guess that's true\""]
["10:11,660","10:19,260","\"So if a Digimon dies in the real world do it go back to digital world or is it dead dead?\""]
["10:19,260","10:22,780","\"I don't know if they ever clarify that in this game\""]
["10:22,780","10:28,940","\"Is it different depending on continuity probably how does how do Digimon?\""]
["10:28,940","10:34,300","\"Like what are they actual monsters? Are they just data like what like they're supposed to be data?\""]
["10:34,300","10:38,460","\"- If I remember correctly, they just happen to be\""]
["10:38,460","10:43,100","\"like on an alternate reality that just happens to like\""]
["10:43,100","10:46,620","\"be informed by the data that we create in the real world.\""]
["10:46,620","10:48,900","\"- So they are technically like real monsters?\""]
["10:48,900","10:51,220","\"- Yes, they're like their own living creatures\""]

["10:53,500","10:54,820","\"- I think they're supposed to be data though\""]
["10:54,820","10:55,660","\"'cause when they die.\""]
["10:55,660","10:57,020","\"- Yes, that they reform.\""]
["10:57,020","11:00,300","\"- That their data gets reformatted.\""]
["11:00,300","11:03,800","\"It probably also depends on which continuity you're in.\""]
["11:03,800","11:09,140","\"I mean, it changed it up and down exactly. Yeah, I'm kind of confused and asking too because I never know\""]
["11:09,140","11:14,580","\"The original virtual pets were supposed to be them dying, but then they changed into the little computer screen\""]
["11:14,580","11:21,380","\"I mean localization fucks everything up to it's true. I mean it doesn't help that lot their names are different just because of that\""]

["19:05,940","19:12,100","\"It's I personally feel like he's at his best when he's writing comedy. I love hotel, Transylvania one\""]

["19:21,240","19:24,560","\"But you can kind of see the influence actually I miss samurai Jack growing up\""]
["19:24,560","19:27,840","\"I never really cared for it then when I grew up I was like oh watch it\""]
["19:27,840","19:31,160","\"I watched the newer one and not the older one which was kind of dumb\""]

["19:35,940","19:39,860","\"Yeah, I'm the old one because the old one is written for kids exactly. It's very simple\""]
["19:39,860","19:46,160","\"Let's see what else he's done. Not that I mind it. You're there still like for me anyway visuals go a really long way\""]
["19:46,160","19:50,860","\"We were talking about it. I really like Dexter's ego trip ego trip is a lot of fun really good\""]
["19:50,860","19:56,040","\"It's a great I was so excited as a kid when I was premiering it's a great conclusion to the series. It doesn't feel like\""]

["20:01,060","20:07,260","\"It doesn't feel like it's straying too far away from like the characters and their core dynamic. Yeah\""]
["20:07,260","20:12,300","\"I remember ego trip was actually kind of hard to find for a little while like anywhere online\""]
["20:12,300","20:14,500","\"Yeah, cuz I had only seen it when I was a kid\""]
["20:14,500","20:19,060","\"I was happy to find out that I guess there was like a tape release of it. There are ways to watch it still\""]
["20:19,060","20:26,180","\"I liked it a lot when it premiered, but it's kind of weird thinking back to that because Julian you and I watched it\""]

["21:04,060","21:07,660","\"You think it wasn't very good, and that's why they were trying to hide it\""]
["21:07,660","21:15,080","\"Probably I remember it just being her fighting over like the name of what her show was going to be or something\""]

["21:56,540","22:01,660","\"That's pretty funny is it is something I'd appreciate more now\""]
["22:01,660","22:07,860","\"Probably not because it's really I don't know maybe because that's fine brek annoying. You're not going to appreciate breath\""]

["23:57,740","24:02,660","\"I think like that's that may be like the least liked show out of all their stuff.\""]
["24:02,660","24:04,460","\"I like to.\""]
["24:04,460","24:09,500","\"I remember being happy every time the pilot was nice that we can connect on it.\""]
["24:09,500","24:11,060","\"I liked a lot on Adult Swim.\""]
["24:11,060","24:16,100","\"It was the thing I always had on in the back while I was working like during high school.\""]
["24:16,100","24:18,660","\"But I guess I should say middle school too.\""]
["24:18,660","24:22,660","\"I know they warned at the beginning don't watch it if you're young, but I did.\""]
["24:22,660","24:25,020","\"I think everybody misbehaved.\""]
["24:25,020","24:26,580","\"You got to watch that raunchy show.\""]
["24:26,580","24:33,020","\"Probably would have been too scared. I probably would have felt like I was doing something wrong home movies is one of my favorite cartoons\""]

["24:43,380","24:49,780","\"Thank you. I remember when I was a teenager. I looked at a video of Brendan's ball teaching you how to play guitar on YouTube\""]
["24:49,780","24:51,780","\"And it really pissed me off\""]
["24:52,340","24:57,760","\"He's like stuff he says something he's being funny, but at the time I didn't get it in the video\""]
["24:57,760","25:01,100","\"He's like stop being a fucking idiot and just listen for a second\""]
["25:01,100","25:03,100","\"I was like wow\""]
["25:03,100","25:08,140","\"Tell he gets frustrated by people who play guitar really sloppy\""]
["25:08,140","25:13,660","\"He's made comments about him like everything he's been attached. Yeah, does it?\""]
["25:13,660","25:21,020","\"It's their metal ocholips repeatedly. It's a it's a thing that he focuses on he is really really really good though\""]
["25:21,020","25:23,020","\"He's insanely good and\""]
["25:23,020","25:27,860","\"Still not trying to see that metal aqua lips. They had squizgar teaching you how to play guitar\""]
["25:27,860","25:31,600","\"No, I think it was a DVD extra or something. No, this is good\""]
["25:31,600","25:38,140","\"It's fun. He gets to play the character while actually teaching you how to do some stuff, which is neat\""]
["25:38,140","25:41,140","\"I'd love metal aqua lips and we've been\""]
["25:41,140","25:44,260","\"It's one of my up. It's still really good. It's really fun\""]
["25:44,260","25:49,980","\"I remember because when I was a teenager, I just took it as like oh look at look at the cool violence\""]
["25:49,980","25:50,980","\"And so well, fun.\""]
["25:50,980","25:51,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["25:51,980","25:56,260","\"And as an adult, you get to be like, oh no, I understand like the social implications.\""]
["25:56,260","25:57,980","\"I understand what it's trying to say.\""]
["25:57,980","25:59,980","\"Yeah, it's a really great show.\""]
["25:59,980","26:01,300","\"Yeah, I love that show.\""]
["26:01,300","26:02,300","\"I just never finished it.\""]
["26:02,300","26:06,180","\"I think I saw season one in most of season two.\""]
["26:06,180","26:08,980","\"It's also a show that was spread out a lot, I remember.\""]
["26:08,980","26:11,060","\"Oh yeah, there's a lot of time between the season.\""]
["26:11,060","26:14,540","\"Like venture brothers, it was one of those things where, you know, you'd go like fucking\""]
["26:14,540","26:16,180","\"five years between seasons.\""]
["26:16,180","26:18,740","\"The episodes originally were not full length.\""]
["26:18,740","26:20,940","\"They were 11 minutes, right?\""]
["26:20,940","26:23,260","\"- Yeah, and then they got expanded to a half hour.\""]
["26:23,260","26:26,220","\"Which is cool, I miss half hour shows.\""]
["26:26,220","26:27,460","\"Nobody makes them anymore.\""]
["26:27,460","26:30,220","\"- We have some tapes that we actually got recently.\""]
["26:30,220","26:33,500","\"Very generously too, by the way.\""]
["26:33,500","26:35,940","\"It was like a dollar or two per tape,\""]
["26:35,940","26:39,300","\"but it's just like six hour recordings of TV broadcasts\""]
["26:39,300","26:42,620","\"from like, one of them's from '97, one of them's from 2000.\""]
["26:42,620","26:45,100","\"I kind of forgot, oh yeah, shows have credits.\""]
["26:45,100","26:48,260","\"They would have a credit sequence that they made.\""]
["26:48,260","26:50,340","\"They would have an intro, they'd have a theme song.\""]
["26:50,340","26:51,540","\"I kind of forgot about all that\""]
["26:51,540","26:54,100","\"'cause television sort of changed structure.\""]
["26:54,100","26:55,500","\"- It's very streamlined for the purposes\""]
["26:55,500","26:56,500","\"of more commercials now.\""]
["26:56,500","26:58,060","\"- Yeah, they keep things moving.\""]
["26:58,060","26:59,540","\"Yeah, you can't really--\""]
["26:59,540","27:01,460","\"- We were having that conversation about\""]
["27:01,460","27:04,100","\"how SpongeBob was unbearable for a while\""]
["27:04,100","27:06,580","\"because the pace was so sped up\""]
["27:06,580","27:09,140","\"that characters were talking over each other.\""]
["27:09,140","27:12,540","\"It made it really disorienting.\""]
["27:12,540","27:15,860","\"- I felt like it was like I have a fever or something.\""]
["27:15,860","27:16,700","\"Do you know what I mean?\""]
["27:16,700","27:22,780","\"like time is distorting. I don't really remember many of the new episodes but what would you say is\""]
["27:22,780","27:27,660","\"the fastest pace you've ever witnessed for like a kid show? Something like that. I don't see it\""]
["27:27,660","27:32,300","\"as much anymore. Chris says that it's still a thing but I don't watch TV so. What would you say is\""]
["27:32,300","27:37,820","\"the slowest pace you remember from a kid's show like growing up? From a kid's show huh? Let me think\""]
["27:37,820","27:44,220","\"that anytime it was on you're like oh man because it would just be too slow for trying to sting.\""]
["27:44,220","27:47,580","\"Oh my god, the worst show I ever saw growing up was Fat Dog Mendoza.\""]
["27:47,580","27:49,320","\"Why does that ring a bell?\""]
["27:49,320","27:50,620","\"It shows sucks.\""]
["27:50,620","27:51,420","\"I don't know.\""]
["27:51,420","27:54,060","\"And I didn't like Robot Jones growing up.\""]
["27:54,060","27:55,740","\"Piss me off.\""]
["27:55,740","27:57,220","\"It made you mad.\""]
["27:57,220","27:57,940","\"I'm a teacher's pet.\""]
["27:57,940","27:59,460","\"I fucking hated teacher's pet.\""]
["27:59,460","28:00,420","\"I mean, that one makes sense to me.\""]
["28:00,420","28:02,060","\"Yeah, I can get that one.\""]
["28:02,060","28:04,140","\"Um, you know what?\""]
["28:04,140","28:07,060","\"I guess that's why the movie is such a weird case.\""]
["28:07,060","28:10,180","\"Yeah, people don't expect it to be as weird as it is.\""]
["28:10,180","28:11,340","\"Why can I not get over it?\""]
["28:11,340","28:13,540","\"It was just kind of educational for the most part.\""]
["28:13,540","28:20,260","\"Have you guys ever watched TV as a kid and just actually noticed that it seemed like way faster and slower than it should?\""]
["28:20,260","28:27,460","\"Like what like I have an example every one time I was watching recess and the opening was going done done\""]
["28:27,460","28:32,100","\"I've had moments like that\""]
["28:32,100","28:35,900","\"Not related to TV, but just like hearing the song sometimes\""]
["28:35,900","28:40,100","\"I'll feel like the pace suddenly is off and then you realize like no it sounds the same\""]
["28:40,340","28:44,960","\"Yeah, you're just kind of like oddly tricking yourself into hearing it slightly fast\""]
["28:44,960","28:50,660","\"TV it's been a really long time since I've noticed it because I haven't had TV since I left home\""]
["28:50,660","28:54,780","\"I have a theory that they might actually speed up or slow down footage sometimes\""]
["28:54,780","28:59,820","\"I'm pretty sure they do a few percentages. Yes. Just like make ads fit better. I'm pretty sure that's a thing\""]
["28:59,820","29:03,740","\"They might do that. Yeah, usually what they would end up doing I because I'm a nerd\""]
["29:03,740","29:05,740","\"Yeah, of course I've researched this\""]
["29:06,860","29:11,380","\"Are you mean you want to well just like how commercials like how all that functions?\""]
["29:11,380","29:17,480","\"That's why you would see during commercial breaks that a commercial starts you'll have something go up and then it cuts off\""]
["29:17,480","29:24,880","\"Yeah, if it's not properly maintaining schedule if things aren't really adding up in terms of like where show needs to start\""]
["29:24,880","29:31,180","\"That's why during ad breaks they can do that they can just chop one short if they really have to they will do things during\""]
["29:31,180","29:34,540","\"Broadcast to just make it all work and fit into schedule\""]
["29:35,820","29:41,300","\"I haven't watched TV in like five years so I could see them doing something like that. No, he's back the slurper\""]
["29:41,300","29:46,180","\"Yeah, but I never witnessed that. I don't think with like a TV show. I feel like I know\""]
["29:46,180","29:49,500","\"Like I feel like I noticed it like ten times growing up\""]
["29:49,500","29:53,120","\"I've noticed I know which would drive me insane\""]
["29:53,120","29:56,300","\"I wish I could think that's a radio station. You don't want that messing that up\""]
["29:56,300","30:02,820","\"I wish I could think back to specific examples because I do know what I just I really specifically remember the recess one because I\""]
["30:02,820","30:06,920","\"In the moment, I was like looking around and I'm like, am I in slow motion?\""]
["30:06,920","30:07,720","\"What's happening?\""]
["30:07,720","30:09,320","\"And I was like moving my hands and shit.\""]
["30:09,320","30:10,220","\"Yeah, really?\""]
["30:10,220","30:11,020","\"Yeah, I was like, what?\""]
["30:11,020","30:11,720","\"Why does it happen?\""]
["30:11,720","30:12,620","\"You're screaming.\""]
["30:12,620","30:17,620","\"I'm just like, it was just really weird.\""]
["30:17,620","30:19,120","\"By the way, I love recess too.\""]
["30:19,120","30:20,320","\"What would you do?\""]
["30:20,320","30:21,920","\"Yeah, we're watching some recess again.\""]
["30:21,920","30:22,720","\"It actually holds up.\""]
["30:22,720","30:23,520","\"It's really entertaining.\""]
["30:23,520","30:24,020","\"It's true.\""]
["30:24,020","30:24,220","\"Yeah.\""]
["30:24,220","30:25,720","\"YouTube was suggesting episode.\""]
["30:25,720","30:27,020","\"Yeah, like crazy.\""]
["30:27,020","30:28,820","\"But yeah, no, it's a lot of fun.\""]
["30:28,820","30:29,920","\"It was fun to go back to.\""]
["30:29,920","30:32,420","\"What would you say is the most evil color, Chris?\""]
["30:32,420","30:35,420","\"I always thought of green.\""]
["30:35,420","30:37,420","\"Dark gray.\""]
["30:37,420","30:40,420","\"That makes sense. I can see that.\""]
["30:40,420","30:42,420","\"Green's pretty good.\""]
["30:42,420","30:47,420","\"We watched Sleeping Beauty a while back and I forgot how much I love the colors in that movie.\""]
["30:47,420","30:50,420","\"I love the visuals in that movie.\""]
["30:50,420","30:56,420","\"It may not be the most interesting story wise at all, but it's very, very, very stylized.\""]
["30:56,420","30:57,420","\"It's great to look at.\""]
["30:57,420","31:04,460","\"Yeah, I like the evil layer being lit up with green fire everywhere. I like my Leficent's face being lit up with green everywhere\""]
["31:04,460","31:08,460","\"I like my Leficent's hands being lit up with green everywhere\""]
["31:08,460","31:15,740","\"I like my Leficent takes off her clothes and comes over to me and what what if she turns her ass into a dragon's asshole\""]
["31:15,740","31:19,540","\"It feels really this is crystal. You please take me\""]
["31:19,540","31:23,980","\"I miss killing Maleficent as a little boy called Sora\""]
["31:25,420","31:31,380","\"Maybe one day you can stick your key back in her hole. Okay. Did that even go anywhere in Kingdom Hearts 3?\""]
["31:31,380","31:35,940","\"I bet it didn't probably not no probably not. I didn't beat it\""]
["31:35,940","31:42,620","\"It's even more you're actually sucking so hard lately it pisses me off. We we did try Kingdom\""]
["31:42,620","31:47,660","\"3 fucking garbage it was incredibly boring and we just shut it off\""]
["31:47,660","31:53,340","\"Actually, I thought the first world was pretty fun with Hercules and then after that is oh my the Hercules one\""]
["31:53,340","31:58,220","\"The only thing that really made that interesting to me was the first time ever seeing other characters\""]
["31:58,220","32:04,280","\"That they had NPCs that they designed. Yeah, it's usually Kingdom Hearts worlds. It's supposed to be like oh you're here in this movie\""]
["32:04,280","32:08,700","\"By the way, everyone's mysteriously vanished and there's only two characters here. Yeah, that's true\""]
["32:08,700","32:14,880","\"But uh yeah, it just wasn't that interesting. We're playing it on the hardest too and the combat was nothing\""]
["32:14,880","32:17,340","\"I really hated the Toy Story world because\""]
["32:17,340","32:21,340","\"That's not in the movie like you could have done a house to burn\""]
["32:21,820","32:28,440","\"That's exactly I choked because I was so excited to say it. It's exactly what DingDong and I were always saying that\""]
["32:28,440","32:31,440","\"It should be like the Clayton fight that\""]
["32:31,440","32:39,080","\"Writing around on a huge heartless or something character for maybe perfect that would have rocked it would have been so much fun\""]
["32:39,080","32:41,760","\"It was so generic and shit. God damn it\""]
