["05:21,340","05:23,980","\"You probably wouldn't get fat anyway you'd go crazy\""]
["05:23,980","05:28,140","\"Not sleeping so that's the time I mean you could always you know\""]
["05:28,140","05:32,380","\"I guess you could pass out though, right? Like if you got hit in the head\""]
["05:32,380","05:36,060","\"I guess you could pass out yeah if you put like a plastic bag over your face yeah\""]
["05:36,060","05:40,440","\"Yeah, I'm just saying if we if we can reclaim that eight hours a day\""]

["05:47,360","05:51,860","\"We could unlock many superpowers. Yeah, I always say that yeah\""]
["05:51,860","05:55,820","\"Say that on a regular basis\""]
["05:55,820","05:59,580","\"Unlocking the other 95% of your brain. I think on a daily basis\""]
["05:59,580","06:03,940","\"Yeah, you have that that bottled drink that you say improves brain health\""]

["06:23,340","06:25,660","\"Did you ever play any of these games? Oh?\""]
["06:26,820","06:33,220","\"You missed out Zachary. I'm familiar with this one because I edited your last playthrough of it\""]
["06:33,220","06:37,620","\"But this is definitely not how it starts. This guy should have killed her by now\""]
["06:37,620","06:44,060","\"That actually is scary. What's the better? I've never actually played any version of Resident Evil 3 before\""]
["06:44,060","06:46,780","\"This is all new to me\""]
["06:46,780","06:49,620","\"This actually is pretty scary. He's gigantic\""]

["06:59,060","07:03,280","\"Isn't Jill supposed to be a cop or something? Well, she's a star\""]
["07:03,280","07:09,300","\"Stars. Yeah, they're like a SWAT team. So she's like a super elite cop even\""]
["07:09,300","07:14,980","\"But did that get established here? Is she just a lady right now? I mean, this is the third game\""]
["07:14,980","07:17,480","\"So it's a game who she is\""]
["07:17,480","07:22,540","\"No, this is a new foe. She's never seen this guy before\""]
["07:22,540","07:26,080","\"I was asking so this is she was just like reading something and this dude just broke through\""]
["07:26,080","07:28,400","\"Like he just shows up like terminator\""]
["07:28,400","07:34,740","\"Zach so basically in the first game you're sent into the woods to like look at this matching because you're like a SWAT team\""]
["07:34,740","07:35,500","\"Right?\""]
["07:35,500","07:38,860","\"Because there's like a bunch of grizzly murders and all this other crap\""]
["07:38,860","07:45,380","\"But when you go in you find out that uh, there's a bunch of zombies there from experiments done by this medical corporation called umbrella\""]
["07:45,380","07:49,020","\"Yeah, that but you're so I know that plot like the whole thing with a bad shit in the woods\""]
["07:49,300","07:55,660","\"So my god, so now this umbrella made this guy to like take you out because you're trying to expose them for what they did\""]
["07:55,660","07:58,860","\"Oh, okay, they made this big fucking monster\""]
["07:58,860","08:01,260","\"Does he beholden to the umbrella thing?\""]
["08:01,260","08:04,140","\"What do you mean? Oh my god?\""]
["08:04,140","08:06,140","\"Does he take their orders?\""]
["08:06,140","08:10,020","\"Yeah, here's you yeah, yeah, no he's a little lap dog\""]
["08:10,020","08:14,380","\"This is like this is like that truck chase for segment you too\""]
["08:16,900","08:23,280","\"And then spoiler alert at the end of the game Jill spills a glass of water and he gets afraid of it\""]
["08:23,280","08:28,680","\"And she finds out he's just afraid of regular water exactly like that fucking FBI trouble\""]
["08:28,680","08:36,640","\"His water she's just gonna chitchat with this guy. Oh after that giant monster almost killed her\""]
["08:36,640","08:40,680","\"And I don't know what the hell that thing was\""]
["08:42,880","08:46,500","\"Maybe we should get out of here babe. I don't know how much longer we have you know\""]
["08:46,500","08:49,580","\"This might be our last chance to like kiss or have sex or something\""]
["08:49,580","08:53,860","\"I don't know I'm just saying like if you wanted to look like people are running like the\""]
["08:53,860","08:56,280","\"Sirens going up. I guess we might as well just fuck me\""]
["08:56,280","08:58,860","\"The sirens are going up and people are running. I mean that doesn't happen that often\""]
["08:58,860","09:03,060","\"Because it's fucking ran through a poll. Yeah, that guy is an idiot\""]
["09:03,060","09:09,580","\"So this is just as society's starting to collapse pretty much. Yeah, the outbreaks happening\""]
["09:09,580","09:13,580","\"So this isn't just Nemesis, there's other zombies out there too.\""]
["09:13,580","09:15,580","\"The zombie outbreak, yes.\""]
["09:15,580","09:20,580","\"And Jill's been trying to warn the entire town up until this point nobody listened to her.\""]
["09:20,580","09:24,580","\"They're like, \"\"This is Raccoon City, nothing bad ever happens here!\"\"\""]
["09:24,580","09:26,580","\"Pretty much.\""]
["09:26,580","09:29,580","\"To be fair, she does look a little bit like a chicken little bitch.\""]
["09:29,580","09:31,580","\"She does look like chicken little.\""]
["09:31,580","09:33,580","\"She reminds me of a chicken little from that movie.\""]

["09:35,580","09:37,580","\"There's silly people coming.\""]
["09:37,580","09:39,760","\"They're just like they're goofing around over here\""]
["09:39,760","09:47,460","\"Classic prank\""]
["09:47,460","09:55,540","\"Again, why did that happen?\""]
["09:55,540","09:59,580","\"Because I walked right into I'm looking at it Brad's kind of sort of lived his whole life without\""]
["09:59,580","10:03,420","\"Consequences as is evidenced by his name being Brad so\""]
["10:03,980","10:09,860","\"It's about time he had a little bit of a wake-up call. What the hell when did this happen? When did this get put behind me?\""]
["10:09,860","10:13,060","\"Good luck now\""]
["10:13,060","10:17,620","\"Okay, it's a little musical chairs game\""]
["10:17,620","10:24,380","\"What would she not try to run that was awesome cuz she's hurt she's touching her tummy\""]
["10:24,380","10:29,720","\"She has a tummy at Chris. Yeah, I feel like something's wrong. I feel like my controller's not working or something\""]
["10:32,100","10:36,540","\"Jill's got a boo boo and her belly button is gonna collapse out of her if she runs. Oh, no Brad\""]
["10:36,540","10:46,620","\"We're gonna make a room for\""]
["10:46,620","11:00,460","\"See if he from the first movie or the first game, what is he for the pilot?\""]
["11:00,840","11:02,840","\"Look now I'm walking again. What the fuck is this?\""]
["11:02,840","11:09,980","\"Now you're still holding your tummy tum. Yeah, but she was running in the cutscene she ran in the door\""]
["11:09,980","11:15,360","\"Yeah, but until you get a pepto bismol. She's not gonna be able to sprint in game. So give me this\""]
["11:15,360","11:18,000","\"Don't go\""]
["11:18,000","11:23,060","\"Apologize to that fucking green dead man. She's polite\""]
["11:23,060","11:29,200","\"Well, she's basically stripping him of the second amendment right. So yeah, maybe an apology is in order\""]
["11:29,200","11:41,580","\"I'm just gonna try not to go near them I would advise that you draw and this\""]
["11:41,580","11:46,540","\"looks really good though it looks like walking you guys this would be our\""]
["11:46,540","11:55,620","\"would be cry did you scary ah there's a dodge button okay can you roll before\""]
["11:55,620","12:01,880","\"you can run? Nope. Because that's the way that children do it, right? First you learn\""]
["12:01,880","12:07,240","\"to crawl, then you learn to walk, then you learn to roll, then you learn to run. You say\""]
["12:07,240","12:12,640","\"rolly happens after walking? Yeah, it happens after walking, but prior to running. I think\""]
["12:12,640","12:16,620","\"rolly happens after running in some cases. I've heard of evidence of papers saying so.\""]
["12:16,620","12:21,720","\"I feel like you learn how to roll and then running or weaving or kind of interchangeable.\""]
["12:21,720","12:25,840","\"I feel like I learned how to do a spin weave around the same time. I learned how to run\""]
["12:25,840","12:31,560","\"She can fucking run. It's just my controller is not working. Oh, no, really? Oh, it's using I'm using my keyboard now\""]
["12:31,560","12:36,860","\"It's got a bit bumper on it. It must have something wrong. I guess I'm just gonna ditch the controller. Okay\""]
