["01:47,560","01:53,960","\"Yeah, I think there is a map that is not a good map. I mean it's better than most\""]
["01:56,120","01:58,120","\"Remember when you had to use maps to drive around?\""]
["01:58,120","01:59,760","\"No\""]
["01:59,760","02:06,560","\"Even I'm not that old my mom and dad used to have to do it. There were still GPS's when I was 16 really\""]
["02:06,560","02:09,520","\"Here I\""]
["02:09,520","02:15,100","\"I'm pretty sure there were I don't know if I used one. I knew my town well enough by the time I\""]

["02:17,680","02:20,960","\"We're barely old enough to just have missed that. Oh, yeah\""]
["02:20,960","02:24,560","\"That's what I would do I would just map quest things and I had to drive far away\""]
["02:24,560","02:30,480","\"Oh, yeah, but if you did that and then you like got off the path you'd be like fucked. Yeah\""]
["02:30,480","02:33,720","\"You ever go off the beaten path\""]
["02:33,720","02:40,720","\"No, not when I was relying on map quest. No, what the hell is this supposed to be? It's like a flickering light. I think oh\""]
["02:40,720","02:43,720","\"Ambience\""]
["02:43,720","02:49,640","\"Or yeah like a light glancing off like a spirit logic you go out that door there\""]
["02:49,640","02:52,320","\"Is that where you originally came in\""]
["02:52,320","03:03,620","\"Yeah, I think that only does damage from far away than your normal. Yeah, that's I think that that's like a like a closer range\""]
["03:03,620","03:11,380","\"Makes more sense. I just didn't think this game would use actual logic. That's all it does when it chooses to\""]
["03:11,380","03:17,120","\"Oh, god, okay, well we're out here now\""]
["03:17,560","03:23,460","\"Yeah, wherever the elevator is you can it said it was on the west side of the ship that wouldn't that have been the area?\""]
["03:23,460","03:29,700","\"He was in maybe you got you got keys to a kitchen and keys to an elevator. I missed he said yeah\""]
["03:29,700","03:31,540","\"The kitchen was in one F. I\""]
["03:31,540","03:37,820","\"Do like the way his sprite looks like it is like an old metal gear game\""]
["03:37,820","03:45,460","\"You can you can tell like buy this like his head square like that reads really well. He's very rugged. Yeah\""]
["03:45,460","03:45,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:45,960","03:49,160","\"Did it do this song?\""]

["03:58,460","04:00,060","\"So you want to go left, not right.\""]
["04:00,060","04:00,660","\"Whoa.\""]

["04:24,420","04:26,640","\"Oh, is that the elevator? No, level up.\""]
["04:26,640","04:29,220","\"Sure looks like an elevator.\""]
["04:29,220","04:32,180","\"Do you have to manually use the key?\""]
["04:32,180","04:33,940","\"And maybe you have to manually use the key.\""]
["04:33,940","04:37,960","\"You walk up to it and try to use maybe you're right.\""]
["04:37,960","04:41,060","\"Like context sensitive stuff.\""]

["04:52,980","05:01,300","\"Maybe try going you're sorry you went right. Yeah, so maybe try going as far left as you can and see if you find an elevator\""]
["05:01,300","05:06,640","\"That way I'm pretty sure it even says like the elevators on the west side. Yeah, it's it so\""]
["05:06,640","05:09,060","\"So over here\""]
