["05:47,360","05:51,360","\"combined chapter one with chapter two but that's just me.\""]
["05:51,360","05:55,360","\"Probably didn't even know if it was going to make a single dollar when they released it.\""]
["05:55,360","05:59,360","\"But it was fucking free when they released the first two. They probably thought that it was\""]
["05:59,360","06:03,360","\"they were working at a dollar store when they released this game.\""]
["06:03,360","06:09,360","\"It was a last stage effort. They already released their chips and sons lumber company and everybody said they made shitty weird\""]
["06:09,360","06:11,360","\"Amentromic looking games\""]
["06:11,360","06:17,360","\"And so they're like we'll show you so they made poppy play time. Yeah, then everything of the rest is history\""]
["06:17,360","06:25,600","\"They did a very successful kickstarter campaign where the two skeletons from poppy play time were like it's a game where you don't have to hurt anyone\""]
["06:25,600","06:27,360","\"That's true\""]
["06:27,360","06:32,200","\"I mean technically Chris Dennis Ray when he just dropped a box on him. He still lived though\""]

["07:09,360","07:13,760","\"I've actually heard that\""]
["07:13,760","07:21,880","\"It might be a spoiler some of you shouldn't say it don't say it if this game is 30 minutes you can wait to say it\""]
["07:21,880","07:23,880","\"I\""]
["07:23,880","07:28,900","\"Wanted to thank you for free. I was stuck in there for so long\""]

["08:03,800","08:08,600","\"Okay, I do again. I do feel like this mechanic could have been in the first game\""]
["08:08,600","08:13,680","\"Because it's fun. It's fun to like grapple and swing and shit. It's like cool concept\""]
["08:13,680","08:19,960","\"There's nothing more fun than like the feeling of like swinging and shit in video games is a pretty good one\""]

["08:34,960","08:36,960","\"You just trust that thing?\""]
["08:36,960","08:37,960","\"I would.\""]
["08:37,960","08:42,960","\"A sentient doll that's able to teleport around seems mildly important to follow the advice of.\""]

["09:20,560","09:26,640","\"You should have been able to fucking swing on things name one part of chapter one that would have been enhanced by swing\""]
