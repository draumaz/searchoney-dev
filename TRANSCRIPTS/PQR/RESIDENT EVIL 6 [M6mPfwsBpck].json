["11:14,300","11:17,840","\"Okay, I have a kick, but you're not doing a very good job with it\""]
["11:17,840","11:20,540","\"His head was like peeling off as he was being shot\""]
["11:20,540","11:27,620","\"I guess they just fall apart. It's just a free-made animation. It's really cool though\""]
["11:27,620","11:37,020","\"Wow, do you feel crazy right now? I kind of feel like I'm going nuts. It's karate time\""]

["12:02,740","12:11,360","\"All right dude in this game, I think you run out of ammo like really quickly so\""]
["12:11,360","12:14,740","\"conservative\""]
["12:14,740","12:20,540","\"You say in this game, but I don't know I feel like that's true in most Resident Evil\""]
["12:20,780","12:26,440","\"Yeah, but I think this one's especially bad because it's trying to be like an action game and then you forget that it's not\""]
["12:26,440","12:32,140","\"Am I not supposed to be standing here or is it not gonna let me through till I do the quick shot is that the quick shot?\""]

["13:17,460","13:24,260","\"Thought it was fun. Did you beat it? No, I beat Leon's campaign and that was it. Oh, there's multiples\""]
["13:24,260","13:27,460","\"spoiling the game\""]
["13:27,460","13:36,660","\"And here am I supposed to hold a or tap it I don't know I think I think hold it that does not look right\""]
