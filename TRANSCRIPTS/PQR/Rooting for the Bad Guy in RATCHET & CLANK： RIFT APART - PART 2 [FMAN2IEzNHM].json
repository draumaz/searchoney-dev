["04:56,020","05:00,520","\"Really is just a matter of sequence\""]

["05:06,160","05:08,160","\"I actually don't know.\""]
["05:08,160","05:09,160","\"Um...\""]
["05:09,160","05:16,160","\"I don't want to like red flag the three female viewers that we have, but I really do like fight club.\""]
["05:16,160","05:18,160","\"You know what baby driver was really good.\""]
["05:18,160","05:19,160","\"I don't know.\""]

["05:20,160","05:23,160","\"I thought it was really fun, but I've only watched it the one time that he came out of.\""]
["05:23,160","05:25,160","\"I never needed to watch it again.\""]
["05:25,160","05:27,160","\"I typically do only watch movies one time.\""]
["05:27,160","05:29,160","\"Maybe two, I guess.\""]
["05:29,160","05:30,160","\"I want to stop.\""]
["05:30,160","05:34,160","\"Yeah, no, I've actually come to the point where I don't like seeing movies more than a lot now.\""]
["05:34,160","05:38,580","\"I used to have like a hard like I'm never gonna watch a movie twice\""]
["05:38,580","05:45,380","\"And maybe that is why fight club was like whoa really early on because like that's a movie that like begs you to watch it twice\""]
["05:45,380","05:49,520","\"And it is really a different movie the two times you watch so that's a movie\""]
["05:49,520","05:52,880","\"I could watch twice which is why it was my favorite for a while\""]
["05:52,880","05:58,000","\"It's not because of all the like I don't know whatever people fucking get mad at people for liking that movie\""]
["05:58,000","06:01,780","\"I didn't know that was a thing to get mad at people for liking fight clothes\""]
["06:01,780","06:09,060","\"It's like a Rick and Morty kind of thing where like the people that really like it and the people that really dislike it both to kind of\""]
["06:09,060","06:11,340","\"our assholes\""]
["06:11,340","06:13,180","\"That's fair\""]
["06:13,180","06:16,780","\"It's like one of those things where like there are people that dislike it where it's like\""]
["06:16,780","06:21,420","\"Fight Club is about a fucking dude who's a fucking man and he's ran\""]
["06:21,420","06:24,880","\"And it's like fight clubs kind of about how that guy is like an asshole\""]
["06:24,880","06:30,840","\"So it's I don't know and then there's people that also love the movie, but also don't get that you find a riff\""]
["06:30,840","06:33,900","\"You found a rip. Yeah, let's rip it open boy\""]
["06:33,900","06:38,600","\"Keep boyin and keep livin. That's my message to you audience\""]
["06:38,600","06:42,720","\"Do you think they'll quote that for years to come fuck?\""]
["06:42,720","06:45,600","\"I can I didn't die. Yeah, you're right\""]

["06:59,240","07:08,640","\"The stream of Earth. Oh dude that'd be a great great movie the stream of Earth. We could have all of our Twitch streamer favorites\""]
["07:08,640","07:12,040","\"So what needs to make a movie about how shitty\""]
["07:12,040","07:16,280","\"being like a fucking content creator is\""]
["07:16,280","07:24,760","\"About all the downsides of it about how unhealthy it is to think like one you can get this and you can put on\""]
["07:25,240","07:30,580","\"Yeah, oh robot that's cool. It goes on and off its head when a cutscene starts\""]
["07:30,580","07:35,580","\"So it doesn't like ruin cutscenes by being like this like mmm. It's mono, you know, yeah\""]
["07:35,580","07:38,020","\"I get you it's cool also. Yeah, let me clarify\""]
["07:38,020","07:46,620","\"What I meant was yeah, literally just to think like a content creator and get so invested in the world of daily uploads and shit like that\""]
["07:46,620","07:53,420","\"I feel like a lot of content creators themselves have tried to make that but it comes across as super shitty because it's like\""]
["07:53,660","07:58,780","\"Because it's like I don't appreciate the audience and then the like all of the opportunities has given me kind of thing\""]
["07:58,780","08:01,420","\"Kind of I also feel like they try to oversell it\""]
["08:01,420","08:07,620","\"I did like the new bow Burnham special cuz like I've seen it it does it does show him kind of like it's a little bit sad\""]
["08:07,620","08:13,120","\"But it doesn't try to oversell it is like bow Burnham is suffering so profoundly. It's just like oh\""]
["08:13,120","08:19,180","\"It's kind of weird that he like like there's just a scene in it where he like he just turns 30\""]
["08:19,180","08:22,300","\"It's like him next to a clock. He's like all right. I just turned 30\""]
["08:22,300","08:28,060","\"I guess I'm gonna go back to making it dude the dancer at turn 30 was so fucking sad and fucked up\""]
["08:28,060","08:35,980","\"Did you hate it? It's so bad about being in your 30s evil. Yeah, don't ever do it kids. I love it\""]
["08:35,980","08:40,540","\"Well love being older. I get to sit in my fart in couch all day\""]
["08:40,540","08:44,940","\"See this is the this is the difference between someone who commits to being bald and someone who doesn't\""]
["08:44,940","08:48,940","\"I guess so\""]
["08:48,940","08:54,560","\"I love the wisdom that's come with growing up and being alive for longer than other people.\""]
["08:54,560","08:55,380","\"True.\""]
["08:55,380","08:59,580","\"I like how he's screaming out loud in this club like, \"\"Hey!\""]

["09:06,500","09:09,820","\"Drugs? I heard I can buy drugs here!\"\"\""]

["09:17,340","09:19,340","\"I\""]
["09:19,340","09:24,220","\"Look over blood cowabunga\""]
["09:24,220","09:31,520","\"You know what I really whoa, you know, it's jarring me at the most hmm every time the camera changes\""]
["09:31,520","09:37,980","\"There's not like textures fading in and out or you know little frame skips or whatever. Yeah, no it's like flawless so far\""]
["09:37,980","09:44,220","\"It's freaking too good. It's amazing. I don't understand how they do it, man. I don't understand why it's real\""]
["09:45,620","09:47,620","\"It's skid McMark's\""]
["09:47,620","09:54,740","\"The ps5 really did does seem like it was a huge like step forward from the ps4\""]
["09:54,740","09:58,660","\"I feel like this game is specifically made to make you feel that way\""]
["09:58,660","10:05,860","\"Like I feel like they probably were like you take advantage of our solid state drive and that's why the dimension well\""]
["10:05,860","10:12,300","\"I bought like that's why the dimension thing is a thing and it works like\""]
["10:12,620","10:14,840","\"I'm not saying that is a bad thing by the way\""]
["10:14,840","10:21,040","\"I don't know that like the game needed it but like sometimes you know creativity comes out of like a limitation or like a\""]
["10:21,040","10:23,240","\"Like a prompt\""]
["10:23,240","10:26,640","\"Sony was probably like you got to do something where they like\""]
["10:26,640","10:29,200","\"move fast\""]
["10:29,200","10:34,740","\"That's another thing that I that I learned semi recently is a lot of games\""]
["10:34,740","10:38,640","\"Like the second you stop looking at something it disappears. Yeah\""]
["10:41,120","10:48,560","\"Yeah, that's why a lot of games like they have a reason they have some annoying thing where you're like why can't my character?\""]
["10:48,560","10:54,600","\"Just I don't know sprint forever or like do something like it's literally the game being like if you do that you're gonna freeze\""]
["10:54,600","10:59,960","\"So like we got a we got to artificially slow you down. I don't want to give it away\""]
["10:59,960","11:03,660","\"But this game has parts where you move really really fast\""]
["11:05,120","11:11,600","\"And then faster than in Sonic adventure. Oh you fucking better believe it sonic eat your heart out\""]
["11:11,600","11:16,800","\"There's a new speedster on the block and his name is Chris O'Neill Wow\""]
["11:16,800","11:21,300","\"Yeah, that's a lot of pressure for you. Yeah, and you got to rise to the occasion\""]
["11:21,300","11:26,160","\"You know what I've kind of noticed recently too that I keep putting you on the spot. I'm sorry\""]
["11:26,160","11:28,240","\"Can you stop just stand for a second to look around?\""]
["11:28,240","11:33,920","\"Look up in the sky like all of the lights. They all they all have like\""]
["11:34,320","11:38,600","\"Raise like you know casting down the volumetric lighting right yeah ray tracing\""]
["11:38,600","11:44,360","\"Well like a year or two ago that shit was super super intensive\""]
["11:44,360","11:46,400","\"But now because of like the ray tracing cards\""]
["11:46,400","11:52,280","\"It's like everything is using it and everything looks 20 times better now. Yeah, it's crazy how much of a difference\""]
["11:52,280","11:57,700","\"Just that one thing makes it's all about dedicated ray tracing colors. I just can't believe that\""]
["11:57,700","12:02,120","\"We've come this far so fast people say graphics don't make the video game\""]
["12:02,120","12:05,800","\"But we're smart and earthbound shit and no\""]

["13:35,240","13:36,240","\"Did you?\""]
["13:36,240","13:37,240","\"You should be.\""]
["13:37,240","13:38,240","\"This cyberpunk still fucked.\""]
["13:38,240","13:39,240","\"Yes.\""]
["13:39,240","13:40,240","\"Absolutely.\""]
["13:40,240","13:41,240","\"That's awesome.\""]
["13:41,240","13:43,160","\"We should pick it up again sometime.\""]
["13:43,160","13:47,520","\"It's not glitchy like it was if that's what you mean, but it's still like...\""]
["13:47,520","13:52,600","\"I didn't think half the glitches we experienced were because we didn't upgrade the graphics\""]
["13:52,600","13:55,200","\"drivers before we started playing it.\""]
["13:55,200","13:56,900","\"Uh, really?\""]
["13:56,900","13:59,800","\"I mean, we definitely didn't at the time.\""]
["13:59,800","14:02,900","\"That's that's what it definitely made it funny.\""]
["14:02,900","14:09,200","\"Honestly, I kind of like that's pretty much the only reason to play it is to like fucking laugh at the glitches.\""]
["14:09,200","14:15,800","\"I'm sure it's still got a zillion of them, but also like not everything wrong with that game was a glitch, which is unfortunate.\""]
["14:15,800","14:19,800","\"Yeah, because I think I heard about that was there's like a class action lawsuit against it.\""]
["14:19,800","14:21,700","\"Yeah, really by whom?\""]
["14:21,800","14:29,180","\"I think by the like shareholders. Yeah. Oh, that's right. It's insane. Yeah on what grounds though\""]
["14:29,180","14:36,060","\"On the ground to really get to sue somebody for not deliver not delivering you the profits you wanted like probably\""]
["14:36,060","14:38,380","\"Not supposed to be risk that you take\""]
["14:38,380","14:44,080","\"From their perspective they could be like you could have fucking worked on it more\""]
["14:44,080","14:50,000","\"You just kind of fuck this by rushing it out. I don't know. Yeah, I think I\""]
["14:50,920","14:56,640","\"I think that it has something to do with like the PlayStation Store like the game was in such a bad state\""]
["14:56,640","15:03,120","\"Oh, yeah, the PlayStation Store did take it down temporarily didn't it's still down it's still down to this day\""]
["15:03,120","15:05,760","\"Yeah, wait you still can't buy this on a PlayStation store\""]
["15:05,760","15:11,400","\"Cyberpunk no you can or sorry. That's what I meant night this cyberpunk. Yeah, it's pretty crazy\""]
["15:11,400","15:16,320","\"I don't know like my hope for that game is absolutely dead like as it should be like\""]
["15:16,320","15:22,680","\"I think that if that game had no glitches and they just kept like working on it and tweaking shit and just kind of did what they\""]
["15:22,680","15:24,680","\"Did with the Witcher it might have ended up okay\""]
["15:24,680","15:30,160","\"But they're gonna spend so much time fixing like five different versions of that game to get a baseline playable\""]
["15:30,160","15:34,960","\"That it's it's never gonna get kind of the treatment that it needs to get anywhere\""]
["15:34,960","15:38,240","\"I still want to play in quite a bit of it at home, but yeah, I have\""]
["15:38,240","15:41,640","\"like it's not a terrible game, but\""]
["15:43,080","15:49,720","\"It's leaves plenty to be desired. It made me feel like I was being too harsh on fallout for which is not\""]
["15:49,720","15:54,640","\"I know what you mean. Not a fucking glowing review by by any standard\""]
["15:54,640","16:01,800","\"This is the voice of the moist and I've got something to say\""]
["16:01,800","16:04,640","\"to my girlfriend Joyce\""]
["16:04,640","16:09,400","\"The moistest minx in the galaxy moist joist\""]
["16:10,000","16:14,860","\"Joyce the moist will you moist dreamy and holy moisture money\""]
["16:14,860","16:20,020","\"Slides in on her moist parts\""]
["16:20,020","16:22,660","\"on her moist talent mobile\""]
["16:22,660","16:33,740","\"She sounds beautiful I would fucking I would take a towel to her and just wipe my brow with her\""]
["16:33,740","16:36,540","\"That would take a towel to you my love I\""]
["16:37,900","16:42,240","\"Tell you down I wouldn't marry her, but I'd certainly take a towel to her\""]
["16:42,240","16:49,520","\"Hide wipe you a bit. That's the move you do in the gym when you like spread your legs and you go back to front with the towel\""]
["16:49,520","16:54,480","\"Oh, that's it's like the it's like the can you rub lotion on my back. It's like\""]
["16:54,480","16:57,480","\"Can you tell my grundle?\""]

["17:07,280","17:13,800","\"That's my favorite candy these guys are real cool like they have like good squash and stretch on everything\""]
["17:13,800","17:16,160","\"Like their legs and shit especially\""]
["17:16,160","17:18,600","\"It is quite beautiful isn't it?\""]
["17:18,600","17:20,440","\"boom\""]
["17:20,440","17:24,440","\"I'll see a game like Call of Duty with a ton of squash and stretch for no reason\""]
["17:24,440","17:31,680","\"That'd be good like you reload and your fucking arm turns into a noodle. Yeah, I love that. I'm surprised there's nothing like that\""]
["17:32,280","17:36,040","\"We've like the popularity of stuff like Fortnite this bone works\""]
["17:36,040","17:41,600","\"Which is kind of as close to anything like that that I can think of really think so I\""]
["17:41,600","17:45,120","\"Thought it was a VR game it is but it's fucking wacky\""]
["17:45,120","17:48,920","\"Look at that guy\""]
["17:48,920","17:54,420","\"That guy's name is skid Mick Mark see his helmet his helmet like dissolves for the cutscene\""]
["17:54,420","17:57,040","\"They animated it like dissolving and coming back\""]
["17:58,600","18:03,840","\"I've got lots of forbidden porn on there, so don't click around anything. What does he again?\""]
["18:03,840","18:05,480","\"Lombax\""]
["18:05,480","18:09,840","\"Ratchet yeah, he's a Lombax. They're like saying Lombax. It's a fun word\""]
["18:09,840","18:16,560","\"That's a little bit of a thing in this game, so he is the only Lombax\""]
["18:16,560","18:21,700","\"So that's why it's a big deal that there's a femme backs. Yeah, so like\""]
["18:21,700","18:23,880","\"there is\""]
["18:23,880","18:30,200","\"Him and only him and I think they established that the Lombaxes are from like another dimension\""]
["18:30,200","18:33,720","\"That that's why when clank proposed to him at the beginning\""]
["18:33,720","18:39,140","\"I just thought they maybe had been hunted down for their exotic clothes. Yeah, he goes ratchet\""]
["18:39,140","18:42,120","\"Will you know I'm kidding I fixed the dimension thingy\""]
["18:42,120","18:48,540","\"And then yeah, so that was why it was fixing it was because he wanted him to go and find the other Lombaxes\""]
["18:49,400","18:54,220","\"But oh, so that's why they were fixing that thing in the first place, but then it was\""]
["18:54,220","18:57,100","\"appropriated by\""]
["18:57,100","19:01,040","\"What was that guy's name nemesis or something appropriate?\""]
