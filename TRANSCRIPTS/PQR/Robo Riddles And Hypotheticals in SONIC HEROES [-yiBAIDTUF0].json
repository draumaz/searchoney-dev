["06:55,960","06:59,960","\"Maybe the world's not flat, but it is flat because we're on a giant globe and we're the flat part\""]
["06:59,960","07:06,000","\"So they think they think the actual earth is like the size of the Sun. It must be huge. Yeah, and then in the jet\""]

["07:49,720","07:53,040","\"I only found out about that this week and it makes so much sense because I hate chicken\""]
["07:53,040","07:56,380","\"And I don't get why people like chicken so much and that actually makes fucking\""]
["07:56,380","08:02,720","\"Because it's the one me that you're allowed to eat that makes you lose weight\""]
