["02:08,740","02:16,800","\"It's inverting it because in the in the first game that was the end the song I just taught you it's a mysterious power\""]
["02:16,800","02:23,600","\"It's the wrong song. Remember it will help to prove your connection with the royal family\""]
["02:23,600","02:30,160","\"The princess is waiting for you to return to the castle with the stones. All right. We're counting on you\""]
["02:30,160","02:34,680","\"Wait wasn't looking the whole time\""]

["07:35,200","07:38,680","\"- Why would they put in everyone saying the same thing?\""]
["07:38,680","07:42,360","\"- They're individuals, they shouldn't be doing that.\""]
["07:42,360","07:44,720","\"- I guess they just made a prefab and just pasted them.\""]
["07:44,720","07:47,360","\"- You know how kids are, they're imitating each other.\""]
["07:47,360","07:48,200","\"(laughing)\""]

["07:51,440","07:57,700","\"They're not actually mine. That's part of the spider challenge. They're probably not even cursed. They just look like that from birth.\""]
["07:57,700","07:59,700","\"They're like, \"\"What if we trick humans?\"\"\""]
["07:59,700","08:05,540","\"I mean, that's not a guy who was saying everyone's so disgusting. He's so sick of people being like traitors.\""]
["08:05,540","08:08,540","\"Huh? What the fuck?\""]
["08:08,540","08:12,540","\"That was good. I saw the quotation mark.\""]
["08:12,540","08:16,740","\"That quote is fucking stupid. I saw the question mark covering over your heads.\""]
["08:16,740","08:23,740","\"This is what the song should sound like.\""]
["08:23,740","08:26,740","\"I got it right.\""]
["08:26,740","08:29,740","\"It should just give it to me.\""]
["08:29,740","08:31,740","\"Why didn't he let me do it?\""]
["08:31,740","08:37,740","\"There should be dialogue for every situation where you guess a song you don't have yet.\""]
["08:37,740","08:40,740","\"You're only allowed to play this game.\""]
["08:40,740","08:47,140","\"Yeah, they go. Your cheetah guy. Nice try. You're only allowed to play this game once.\""]

["09:06,900","09:14,000","\"Sometimes I go on Kevin. Where do I go up here up his E? It's just a video game. There's no need to be insecure\""]
["09:14,000","09:19,120","\"Explore some guys. I forget actually how to get to death mountain. Is it through Kakariko village? I have to die first\""]
["09:19,120","09:21,120","\"Oh, it's up here. It's a prerequisite\""]
["09:21,120","09:23,700","\"Pre-requium and real life\""]
["09:23,700","09:26,660","\"Why didn't they just like draw stairs properly?\""]
["09:26,660","09:32,740","\"Why didn't they just make a giant ladder that goes from the town all the way to death mountain to the end of the game?\""]
["09:32,740","09:36,420","\"I think I found it. Yes. That's quite correct. It's over that way\""]
["09:36,420","09:40,940","\"Oh my boy is asleep right now please come back another time to play I\""]
["09:40,940","09:45,860","\"Don't even know who you are who's in here. There was a spinner. I heard him\""]

["10:14,580","10:20,460","\"There you go. Oh, this is just a stupid. I'm not reading that\""]
["10:20,460","10:23,900","\"This is tummy-tome\""]
["10:28,300","10:30,600","\"Ugh, what is she doing this time?\""]
["10:30,600","10:33,900","\"Okay, okay, sure, yes. Your name is Tommy Tom.\""]

["11:04,620","11:05,700","\"- You can, you can buy it.\""]
["11:05,700","11:07,860","\"- Now I'd like to ask a favor of you.\""]
["11:07,860","11:09,620","\"No, I don't expect you to do it\""]
["11:09,620","11:11,860","\"just because of the great tip I just gave you.\""]
