["06:21,560","06:23,560","\"I was just like I\""]
["06:23,560","06:28,600","\"Definitely like a family wedding that went on for way way too long\""]
["06:28,600","06:35,480","\"And I had one of these games and just I probably I beat the shit out of that game in the time\""]
["06:35,480","06:41,560","\"It took for the wedding to like end. Holy shit probably Sonic Advance - I have weird memories of just like no Sonic Advance 3\""]
["06:41,560","06:49,000","\"Being on an American road trip and having Sonic Advance 3 and my headphones in I kept going into the sound test and playing the final boss music over and over\""]

["06:51,260","06:58,300","\"Missed it you're getting owned by a freaking club penguin. That's actually\""]
["06:58,300","07:03,580","\"Embarrassing that penguin's been in every single fucking Sonic game to date. What the hell is it really?\""]
["07:04,320","07:06,320","\"Think so sonic 3\""]
["07:06,320","07:12,200","\"No, because sonic 2 and 1 exist so no, so it just started showing up after a point\""]
["07:12,200","07:14,200","\"That's a good point is I don't really like\""]
["07:14,200","07:20,720","\"Sonic enemies don't register in my head really even though I know that they're there's I guess there's a little red egg man\""]
["07:20,720","07:28,360","\"Oh, yeah, you always see the fucking dumb ladybug the buzz beetles and no the buzz beat was the beat is always there\""]
["07:28,360","07:31,700","\"Yeah, I honestly forget I should give it my sonic license\""]
["07:31,700","07:34,940","\"So I honestly forget the goddamn ladybug's names.\""]
["07:34,940","07:35,440","\"Sorry.\""]

["07:37,540","07:39,860","\"I don't really care about the crisp code bug beetle.\""]
["07:39,860","07:40,260","\"You're going down.\""]
["07:40,260","07:42,660","\"Actually, the only one that I do know\""]
["07:42,660","07:46,980","\"is there was this coder for Sonic Mania who made like--\""]
["07:46,980","07:48,620","\"I guess it might be a buzz beetle.\""]
["07:48,620","07:51,220","\"It's a beetle something, but he made like Beatles adventure,\""]
["07:51,220","07:54,180","\"and it was like a Sonic mod that was beloved by people.\""]
["07:54,180","07:55,820","\"And apparently the guy died.\""]
["07:55,820","07:56,820","\"Oh, good.\""]
["07:56,820","07:59,740","\"And so Sonic Mania wanted to do like--\""]
["07:59,740","08:06,300","\"you know tribute tribute thank you that's the word and they put it made it as a part\""]
["08:06,300","08:11,980","\"of the boss fight in the fire stage with a dead guy no that would be horrible tribute\""]
["08:11,980","08:18,620","\"now his beetle creation oh little like beetle you play as is he help no he's a villain oh\""]
["08:18,620","08:22,540","\"but it's just it was just a nice gesture so that's probably the only beetle i know\""]
["08:22,540","08:28,940","\"little sonic that's the only beetle i acknowledge that's probably it didn't you know okay look at\""]
["08:28,940","08:34,140","\"that sorry that was my fault but also in like sonic adventure and shit your fight you're fighting\""]
["08:34,140","08:41,500","\"like gun robots and and shit like that you're not fighting yeah the buzzy bees are gone yeah\""]
["08:41,500","08:47,260","\"they got rid of that uh you know they wanted to keep it more nice take out of sonic style\""]
["08:47,260","08:51,700","\"No, but it's not is what I'm gonna say. There's no bees. There's no\""]
["08:51,700","08:56,260","\"You fucking jeez is okay. Oh\""]
["08:56,260","09:01,140","\"What's up cream my pants if no scratch? There's no grounder\""]
["09:01,140","09:06,300","\"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. That's nothing. That doesn't exist. I\""]
["09:06,300","09:14,800","\"Heard that grounder was the original design for a E-103 gamma really. Yeah, and he was supposed to talk like that\""]
["09:15,340","09:23,340","\"I thought he's definitely Patrick Star.\""]
["09:23,340","09:24,340","\"Oh, see?\""]
["09:24,340","09:25,340","\"Same mistake.\""]
["09:25,340","09:28,340","\"You know the definition of insanity.\""]
["09:28,340","09:30,340","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["09:30,340","09:31,340","\"I know.\""]
["09:31,340","09:33,340","\"Cory, that proves that you are insane.\""]
["09:33,340","09:34,340","\"Oh, we go over.\""]
["09:34,340","09:36,340","\"Do you want to know the definition of an idiot?\""]
["09:36,340","09:38,340","\"Do you want to know the definition of an idiot?\""]
["09:38,340","09:39,340","\"I'm being an idiot.\""]
["09:39,340","09:41,340","\"So you really got to start the entire game again.\""]
["09:41,340","09:44,340","\"Yeah, but I have all my health back.\""]
["09:44,340","09:47,700","\"But though when we play the flying stage, I am gonna want to do it.\""]
["09:47,700","09:48,200","\"- Be tells!\""]
["09:48,200","09:49,940","\"- No, I want to do stages.\""]
["09:49,940","09:51,200","\"I'm not getting all the emeralds.\""]
["09:51,200","09:53,300","\"I remember in this game it was so annoying.\""]
["09:53,300","09:57,420","\"You had to collect all the little like star coins and run, run.\""]
["09:57,420","09:58,740","\"And it was like, no thank you.\""]
["09:58,740","09:59,740","\"- That's impossible.\""]
["09:59,740","10:02,060","\"- It's just, you have to follow a route.\""]
["10:02,060","10:03,060","\"And I don't know the route.\""]
["10:03,060","10:04,500","\"And it's like backtracking and shit.\""]
["10:04,500","10:06,180","\"It's like, I'm not doing that.\""]
["10:06,180","10:07,700","\"It's insanity.\""]
["10:07,700","10:10,620","\"That is, that would be fucking insanity.\""]
["10:10,620","10:14,300","\"I'm gonna play a little better this time and pay more attention to my surroundings.\""]
["10:14,300","10:18,580","\"You're also gonna have two lives didn't they start you with like six\""]
["10:18,580","10:26,160","\"Really not doing any favors. I had six. I just collected them. She's I like his ass mode\""]
