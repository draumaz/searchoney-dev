["08:11,080","08:14,680","\"Did a teenager get really ridiculously good at--\""]
["08:14,680","08:17,800","\"I mean, some people also kind of fetishized drama.\""]
["08:17,800","08:19,800","\"Or is it like that they hide--\""]

["08:31,400","08:33,440","\"- I feel like that's the problem\""]
["08:33,440","08:36,760","\"is the one that we originally remembered.\""]

["08:40,960","08:42,720","\"- And they were matching the style pretty easily.\""]
["08:42,720","08:44,160","\"- Because most of the animations\""]
["08:44,160","08:46,720","\"are just, they're cobbling together existing footage.\""]
["08:46,720","08:48,280","\"- Because it was them, you know,\""]
["08:48,280","08:50,120","\"- But I remember it. - Pugging and everything.\""]

["09:02,400","09:03,560","\"- I'm at a point where it's really just like,\""]
["09:03,560","09:05,520","\"I'm happy people are just making things\""]
["09:05,520","09:07,160","\"and putting it out there even if it's really bizarre.\""]
["09:07,160","09:10,040","\"- Well obviously, that's what I was gonna ask.\""]
["09:10,040","09:13,080","\"Chris, do you have any hobbies that you would say\""]
