["08:02,600","08:06,040","\"She was like an ex-wife at the time that he let move back in with them\""]
["08:06,040","08:10,080","\"Because she got like kicked out of like her daughter's house or something. Yeah\""]
["08:10,080","08:13,000","\"So it's always a good reason to let someone move in with you\""]
["08:13,000","08:15,320","\"So she was she was fine for a bit\""]
["08:15,320","08:19,420","\"But when she would drink it was like night and day psycho shit\""]
["08:19,420","08:22,380","\"And after and he was pretty hard to deal with too\""]
["08:22,380","08:25,820","\"So I'm sure that like he probably pushed her buttons to a certain extent\""]
["08:25,820","08:31,300","\"But like there was a point where every single like they had no hours it could be like night or day\""]
["08:31,300","08:37,500","\"So there was a point where they were fucking screaming at each other like probably three to four hours a day\""]
["08:37,500","08:41,660","\"So there was like an extended period of time where I\""]
["08:41,660","08:44,540","\"Was getting like when I say no sleep\""]
["08:44,540","08:48,060","\"I mean like I would probably get at most like two hours of sleep\""]
["08:48,060","08:49,060","\"I would blow my brain.\""]
["08:49,060","08:50,940","\"- What did you try to deal with that?\""]
["08:50,940","08:54,940","\"I'm sure you tried like ear plugs and drowning it out.\""]
["08:54,940","08:58,540","\"- But it was just fucking like screaming constantly.\""]
["08:58,540","09:01,380","\"So eventually like he cut her off from alcohol\""]
["09:01,380","09:03,460","\"and she got so desperate that like she signed\""]
["09:03,460","09:05,100","\"like a cash for keys agreement.\""]
["09:05,100","09:08,180","\"He was trying to get rid of her for like a year maybe.\""]
["09:08,180","09:12,020","\"And then when he got rid of her, of course that night\""]
["09:12,020","09:14,540","\"she started coming back and we changed the locks\""]
["09:14,540","09:16,060","\"on like everything.\""]
["09:16,060","09:21,700","\"So she was basically like just standing outside the building, outside the gate,\""]
["09:21,700","09:26,140","\"like screaming that she was gonna kill us for like hours at a time every single night.\""]
["09:26,140","09:26,980","\"What the fuck?\""]
["09:26,980","09:27,380","\"And it was like...\""]
["09:27,380","09:28,220","\"That's horrifying.\""]
["09:28,220","09:29,660","\"Just yeah, I mean I...\""]
["09:29,660","09:34,860","\"I guess all it took was one recording and to get a judge to give you a restraining order.\""]
["09:34,860","09:35,660","\"Yeah, I mean...\""]
["09:35,660","09:36,180","\"Did you record it?\""]
["09:36,180","09:38,700","\"I didn't record any of that.\""]
["09:38,700","09:40,860","\"Well, I might have, but I don't have it anymore.\""]
["09:40,860","09:43,340","\"I do have like tons of fucking...\""]

["10:34,860","10:36,740","\"if she got to the other side of the gate\""]
["10:36,740","10:38,980","\"he wouldn't be able to kick her out again.\""]
["10:38,980","10:41,180","\"Which he might not have, 'cause it took him so long\""]
["10:41,180","10:43,100","\"to get rid of her the first time.\""]
["10:43,100","10:46,060","\"But that's why I have a restraining order against her\""]
["10:46,060","10:48,520","\"was just so that if she showed up,\""]
["10:48,520","10:50,460","\"we could call the cops and they could get her to leave.\""]
