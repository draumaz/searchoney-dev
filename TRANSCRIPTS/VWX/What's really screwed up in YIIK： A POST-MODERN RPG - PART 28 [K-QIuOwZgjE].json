["07:57,380","08:02,660","\"Yo, you want to hear screwed up story? Oh, they better not be about me. Yeah, what's up?\""]
["08:02,660","08:09,860","\"See that water tower up there. I bought a week after Sammy pack went missing people in my town started complaining about the color\""]
["08:11,460","08:14,820","\"My house wasn't affected because you have a wealth.\""]
["08:14,820","08:18,860","\"So the water company opens up the tower and they find the body of a girl.\""]
["08:18,860","08:21,940","\"She has no clothes on and she's been in there for days.\""]
["08:21,940","08:22,940","\"That's fucked.\""]
["08:22,940","08:25,940","\"What's really screwed up is she was locked in there.\""]
["08:25,940","08:30,580","\"You can't really lock yourself in a water tower when the water is five feet from the lock.\""]
["08:30,580","08:31,580","\"Even more so.\""]
["08:31,580","08:32,580","\"Yeah, I get it.\""]
["08:32,580","08:33,580","\"Somebody else did it.\""]
["08:33,580","08:34,580","\"I get it.\""]
["08:34,580","08:35,580","\"At least a lamb.\""]
["08:35,580","08:36,580","\"And they rule it in accident.\""]
["08:36,580","08:40,380","\"So some girl accidentally climbs on top of a water tower and picks the lock.\""]
["08:40,380","08:41,380","\"No, I get it.\""]
["08:41,380","08:42,220","\"- Somebody else did it.\""]
["08:42,220","08:43,040","\"I think somebody did it.\""]
["08:43,040","08:43,880","\"- I did it.\""]
["08:43,880","08:44,720","\"- No, wait.\""]
["08:44,720","08:45,900","\"- From the outside.\""]
["08:45,900","08:46,900","\"- From the outside.\""]
["08:46,900","08:48,260","\"From the outside.\""]
["08:48,260","08:50,780","\"- And by the way, the water tower is really tall\""]
["08:50,780","08:52,780","\"so it's hard to get to the top of it.\""]
["08:52,780","08:56,380","\"So it's kind of suspicious of that happened by accident.\""]
["08:56,380","08:58,860","\"- Also on that night, there was five scary-looking men\""]
["08:58,860","09:00,980","\"with machetes all lining around it.\""]
["09:00,980","09:02,660","\"- I usually those aren't out at night,\""]
["09:02,660","09:04,820","\"so you don't tell it to be suspicious.\""]
["09:04,820","09:07,660","\"- Also, there were scary white vans parked everywhere.\""]
["09:10,260","09:12,260","\"Also, Alex tried to kiss me at the...\""]
["09:12,260","09:21,640","\"He reacted as to just that happened.\""]
["09:21,640","09:27,320","\"And you want to know the most fucked up part? No one cared. We still drank the water and it was great.\""]
["09:27,320","09:30,140","\"Somehow these lazy jerks at the news stations\""]
["09:30,140","09:35,800","\"managed to turn what was most likely a horrific murder into a gross story that focused more on the quality of\""]
["09:35,800","09:37,800","\"drinking water than about an actual person.\""]
["09:37,800","09:39,300","\"That's the news for you.\""]
["09:39,300","09:42,420","\"she get up to the water tower I don't see a ladder.\""]
["09:42,420","09:44,980","\"That's what I was thinking.\""]
["09:44,980","09:49,220","\"A logical person would deduce that they removed the ladder so it wouldn't happen again.\""]
["09:49,220","09:52,740","\"They used a helicopter.\""]
["09:52,740","09:53,740","\"They used a helicopter.\""]
["09:53,740","09:56,900","\"There never was one and it's weird that she managed to get up there.\""]
["09:56,900","10:01,740","\"There was never any ladder and you'd need a really big ladder.\""]
["10:01,740","10:04,740","\"What if she used plungers to walk up the side?\""]
["10:04,740","10:05,740","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:05,740","10:07,440","\"As soon as a human fly,\""]
["10:07,440","10:10,140","\"as soon as the costume on and everything.\""]
["10:10,140","10:11,740","\"Human fly here.\""]
["10:11,740","10:16,040","\"Some crazy murderer with a big ladder could still be out there.\""]

["10:27,240","10:30,740","\"Well, that's a missed opportunity for the side boss.\""]
["10:30,740","10:31,740","\"[laughter]\""]
["10:31,740","10:33,240","\"He's sick of boss fight.\""]

["10:34,240","10:36,460","\"It would be an RPG thing.\""]
["10:36,460","10:39,240","\"You know, comically large weapons are very common.\""]
["10:39,240","10:41,780","\"How many times do they say what's even more screwed up?\""]
["10:41,780","10:46,240","\"What's even more screwed up is everyone laughed really hard for days.\""]
["10:46,240","10:47,940","\"We couldn't stop laughing.\""]
["10:47,940","10:49,440","\"It was too funny.\""]
