["03:26,660","03:32,660","\"And their quests are like, kick our fucking turtles into the sea and don't get eaten by fucking like animals.\""]
["03:32,660","03:35,260","\"Or like, walk in a fucking circle!\""]
["03:35,260","03:40,560","\"And even if you do a perfect walk in the fucking circle, they're always like, \"\"Oh, that circle sucks!\"\"\""]
["03:40,560","03:41,460","\"But if you walk in--\""]
["03:41,460","03:43,060","\"What the fuck are you talking about?\""]
["03:43,060","03:47,660","\"This sounds like lunacy, but this is a quest. They're like walking in a circle. Yeah\""]
["03:47,660","03:57,620","\"It sounds like this is a quest you get they're like walking a circle because the people who make these games are using a\""]
["03:57,620","04:03,580","\"shoestring fucking engine that doesn't work properly these fucking games don't make any they don't have good handboxes\""]
["04:03,580","04:09,220","\"Fucking circle Chris\""]
["04:09,860","04:14,260","\"People would like to have a walk in a circle and have a tea party. That's such an adventure\""]

["04:24,580","04:27,780","\"They will they know what I'm talking about you do this fucking circle quest\""]

["04:32,180","04:39,420","\"But it's just like random world quests you get so you do this fucking thing because you have to build your reputation up in order to fucking fly\""]
["04:39,420","04:46,060","\"Because like you're able to fly unlike ever the place but once they introduce a new expansion you have to do all these fucking mundane\""]
["04:46,060","04:53,460","\"Worthless fucking things and it's totally pointless. It was the same way for warlords a drain or where it was like this fucking old reality\""]
["04:53,460","04:59,760","\"Yeah, I know it sounds stupid with like all these like orcs and shit, but holy christ looks like so boring\""]
["04:59,760","05:04,800","\"Chris when they introduced that shit, they had a fucking app associated with it\""]
["05:04,800","05:10,940","\"You had to use your fucking phone app to sign in for your wow rewards in order to play these they seriously were like\""]
["05:10,940","05:13,660","\"They were hyping it forever and then when they released it\""]
["05:13,660","05:20,500","\"It was the most embarrassing waste of time ever it pissed off everywhere in fact Lexi that was Lexi was so excited for that\""]
["05:20,500","05:26,680","\"You know what the worst part it was the fucking paper Mario effect because paper Mario sticker star became the most like bought\""]
["05:26,680","05:32,520","\"Like Mario Party game because people were really excited for a new Mario Party because the last one they had was on the Wii\""]
["05:32,740","05:35,900","\"So it's like that effect where it's like people are really excited for a game\""]
["05:35,900","05:38,820","\"But the next installment is the fucking worst one\""]
["05:38,820","05:45,660","\"But these idiots don't realize it and they keep releasing the same fucking thing until they like see the anger in everybody's eyes\""]
["05:45,660","05:53,500","\"But oh, it's like that's what wow as well. It's just like a glorified phone game with horrible quests that aren't fun\""]
["05:53,500","06:01,620","\"And the pets are ugly the mounts are stupid and you know what also I will say this like there's people who are cool\""]
["06:01,700","06:05,300","\"But there are some like piss there are some cool people like there\""]
["06:05,300","06:10,260","\"I'm like piss babies who play wow and get super like but her because they spent so much time\""]
["06:10,260","06:15,660","\"Trying to get some fucking mount for 1% some ugly stupid dog or something\""]
["06:15,660","06:20,140","\"They invested their entire life savings on and life on to get this fucking mount\""]
["06:20,140","06:25,220","\"Mmm that like they'll never lower the drop rate because anytime they're like do something like\""]
["06:25,220","06:31,460","\"But I dedicated my weekend you're getting this thing and they're like oh, we don't want to lose anybody because we already have a\""]
["06:31,460","06:34,780","\"dwindling fanbase so okay we'll leave it exactly how it is.\""]
["06:34,780","06:40,100","\"Zero point fucking zero zero zero one percent chance of getting a drop in your fucking thing.\""]
["06:40,100","06:42,180","\"Oh I also want to say something to you.\""]

["06:50,860","06:51,860","\"why they do this.\""]
["06:51,860","06:56,660","\"They have normal dungeon, heroic dungeon and like mythic dungeons or some shit or like\""]
["06:56,660","07:01,060","\"hard dungeon or one of those but it's like you can do normal dungeon as much as you want\""]
["07:01,060","07:05,740","\"But you can't do hard dungeon which gives you like good armor for waiting you're like trying to level up\""]
["07:05,740","07:09,820","\"We go do it one time a day. It makes no fucking sense\""]
["07:09,820","07:14,020","\"You can do normal dungeons a bunch of times, but hard dungeons are just slightly stronger fucking enemies\""]
["07:14,020","07:18,600","\"God damn I hate wow you know what I hate I hate blizzard in general\""]
["07:18,600","07:22,540","\"Blizzard has been a failure for so long and also like\""]

["07:27,980","07:34,320","\"It's so annoying is embarrassing anytime. There's a new controversy like it's like oh we are the amount of fucking grown adults\""]

["07:59,140","08:00,140","\"This is crazy.\""]
["08:00,140","08:02,580","\"This is not going to whack you wood.\""]
["08:02,580","08:07,580","\"The graphics are nice, but this is the most boring crap you've ever shown me.\""]
["08:07,580","08:08,580","\"It's a tutorial.\""]
["08:08,580","08:10,780","\"Oh yeah, it's been going over 40 minutes.\""]

["08:17,180","08:18,180","\"We're just like shaking it well.\""]
["08:18,180","08:20,700","\"I hate over watch.\""]
["08:20,700","08:22,620","\"I hate the fucking picture.\""]
["08:22,620","08:24,620","\"The generic style.\""]
["08:24,620","08:30,260","\"I hate the characters. I hate their voices when overwatch first-king dude turn the question\""]
["08:30,260","08:35,600","\"I hate the fact it's so fucking watered down and generic and there's nothing to the lore and everyone obsesses over it\""]
["08:35,600","08:41,880","\"Like it's so deep and cool. Yeah, it's the most boring nothing happens dude overwatch. I was really into it when it first came out\""]
["08:41,880","08:46,740","\"That's because you know it's because I was just I was playing team fortress -\""]
["08:46,740","08:54,380","\"Yeah, I was really in team fortress - yeah, imagine if overwatch head share. I'm always been out for like 10 years before that team fortress\""]
["08:54,380","08:57,300","\"Yeah, team for just two is obviously better and it's also\""]
["08:57,300","09:04,220","\"Characters yeah, it's a great game. Anyone who hasn't played it absolutely should it's way better than overwatch\""]
["09:04,220","09:08,320","\"But anyways the thing about overwatch that brought me in was it was like it was a different\""]
["09:08,320","09:12,020","\"I hadn't played a shooter like that and I liked few characters in it\""]
["09:12,020","09:17,900","\"But they literally over the course of like no time ruined everything they nerfed characters\""]
["09:17,900","09:24,140","\"They changed literal moves in characters and like they only did that further stupid\""]
["09:24,140","09:29,820","\"fucking competition shit they do you know they're like blizzard whatever I\""]
["09:29,820","09:32,500","\"don't know what you call those things like tournaments blizzard tournaments\""]
["09:32,500","09:37,300","\"Overwatch tournaments they did it for that and they ruined everything in order to\""]
["09:37,300","09:40,820","\"do that and then they introduced 30 fucking characters they do not care about\""]
["09:40,820","09:44,500","\"at all by the way I don't care if there's copie amounts of copious amounts of\""]
["09:44,500","09:47,860","\"great porn doesn't matter because the characters are boring in the fucking\""]
["09:47,860","09:51,220","\"game and now when I play it it's like I have a fucking seizure because they don't\""]
["09:51,220","09:55,860","\"What the fuck is happening just colors and lights it's a choice. It's so annoying much\""]
["09:55,860","10:02,740","\"But the thing I wanted to say about Overwatch is why they use it as a scapegoat and it's hilarious because they were\""]
["10:02,740","10:09,700","\"They were announcing a brand new character. They just announced and the only comments you say is like oh what did fucking Blizzard do this time?\""]
["10:09,700","10:17,140","\"Because people aren't stupid. They know Blizzard that when you put these fucking updates out and you say new character announce a new character\""]
["10:17,140","10:20,800","\"announced people know that you did something they already know that anytime\""]
["10:20,800","10:25,000","\"you release an update because you've done it a bunch of times that you did\""]
["10:25,000","10:27,880","\"something wrong and the first thing they do is look at the controversy and you\""]
["10:27,880","10:32,520","\"just get more controversy you're so stupid stuff like new characters in this\""]
["10:32,520","10:36,760","\"controversy my favorite thing about Overwatch is how baby is shit is it's\""]
["10:36,760","10:40,840","\"like the most babified game it's so it's it's going the most toxic community\""]
["10:40,840","10:46,360","\"out of anything I have ever seen I wonder why yeah people get so mad that like oh\""]
["10:46,360","10:51,480","\"I don't get to play as this little like obnoxious hamster rolling around in a ball because I didn't pick the guy with a shield\""]
