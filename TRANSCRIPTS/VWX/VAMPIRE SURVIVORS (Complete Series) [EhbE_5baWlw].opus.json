["01:42,480","01:43,480","\"Let's fall asleep.\""]
["01:43,480","01:45,280","\"That's how I was.\""]
["01:45,280","01:46,880","\"I was like this looks boring.\""]

["01:54,080","01:55,840","\"Well, I'll just, I could see this\""]
["01:55,840","01:58,200","\"having like a risk of brain type appeal.\""]
["01:58,200","01:59,400","\"- Exactly. - That's what it is.\""]
["01:59,400","02:01,440","\"Yeah, once you start getting cool power ups\""]
["02:01,440","02:02,760","\"and leveling up again.\""]
["02:02,760","02:05,640","\"So I think this game is made in Game Maker\""]
["02:05,640","02:08,040","\"'cause all these enemies look like free assets\""]
["02:08,040","02:09,960","\"from Game Pggon. - I like the burger.\""]
["02:09,960","02:11,160","\"- Pggio-do.\""]
["02:11,160","02:14,160","\"All these things are like directly from Game Maker,\""]
["02:14,160","02:15,560","\"it feels like at least.\""]
["02:15,560","02:17,640","\"This looks like a Game Maker game, doesn't it?\""]
["02:17,640","02:18,640","\"Yes!\""]
["02:18,640","02:22,800","\"Like when you walk around the overworld and these are the things you fight in your turn-based\""]
["02:22,800","02:28,000","\"little adventure with your little characters, Steam has a huge problem with really mediocre\""]
["02:28,000","02:29,520","\"fucking game maker games.\""]
["02:29,520","02:32,160","\"Once they started letting any game get on there.\""]
["02:32,160","02:33,720","\"Yeah, there was no damage control.\""]
["02:33,720","02:35,200","\"That was a bad idea.\""]
["02:35,200","02:37,600","\"You know, this is funny.\""]
["02:37,600","02:42,840","\"There is a Discovery Q on Steam and one day I decided I'm going to go through to the Discovery\""]
["02:42,840","02:44,560","\"Q so I decided to do it.\""]
["02:44,560","02:48,400","\"I'm at like 10,000 games I've looked over to my Discovery Q.\""]
["02:48,400","02:50,700","\"I used to be able to see the titles in my Q.\""]
["02:50,700","02:52,160","\"I can't even see it anymore.\""]
["02:52,160","02:54,480","\"It's like now I have so many Q's,\""]

["02:58,640","03:00,960","\"- There was a week like,\""]
["03:00,960","03:03,880","\"firewall. - Maybe about a month ago\""]
["03:03,880","03:06,080","\"where everyone was being recommended a game\""]
["03:06,080","03:07,800","\"called Nazi furry.\""]
["03:07,800","03:08,640","\"(laughs)\""]

["03:18,140","03:22,840","\"You could have been my deal my evil search history, but then Monica got recommended\""]
["03:22,840","03:25,280","\"Nazi furry\""]
["03:25,280","03:32,560","\"Furries three times in the discory discovery queue so I know you're talking\""]
["03:32,560","03:38,860","\"Yeah, and then I went on I went on fucking Twitter and like three people were like what why am I being recommended?\""]
["03:39,240","03:43,580","\"Nazi furry and I was like oh so this is like a this is like an epidemic\""]
["03:43,580","03:46,680","\"This is started. It's not going away\""]
["03:46,680","03:54,320","\"By the way, I have played Nazi furry. It's not that great. It's kind of a bland point-click game with really mediocre fuck scenes\""]
["03:54,320","03:58,400","\"I would not recommend it Nazi worth your time. Yeah, it's definitely not\""]
["03:58,400","04:08,380","\"I think Nazi furry is kind of mediocre, but you should probably check out furry party that one's pretty good\""]
["04:08,380","04:15,060","\"I've never heard of that one Corey why don't you delve into it okay, so it's literally what it is\""]
["04:15,060","04:28,140","\"When you go through Discovery Q the most common game you see if you have adult games open are these like nasty like gnarled 3d\""]
["04:28,140","04:34,780","\"Picture picture games where it's just like single pictures that move like as as if you're watching a PowerPoint\""]
["04:35,500","04:42,220","\"Presentation and these fucking games have clouded the goddamn steam workshop like if you look at the game\""]
["04:42,220","04:48,540","\"It's literally like my naughty nurse fucking three and it's the same goddamn game as my naughty nurse too\""]
["04:48,540","04:50,540","\"It's just a different fucking nurse and\""]

["04:58,060","05:04,940","\"If there's like no gameplay to begin with and I don't care about like generic 3d stuff that you like\""]
["05:04,940","05:10,720","\"It's the kind of 3d stuff you would see if you go to a porn site where if you click it you think you would get like a malware\""]
["05:10,720","05:12,700","\"On your computer. Yeah, it's that kind of\""]
["05:12,700","05:15,480","\"It's like Naruto game will make you come for\""]
["05:15,480","05:17,240","\"Exactly\""]
["05:17,240","05:21,760","\"That has planned the steam workplace and there are a lot of games like that\""]
["05:21,760","05:25,840","\"It's because steam hasn't like they now that you're on a green light\""]
["05:25,840","05:33,160","\"They can't like stop these maniacs from fucking like uploading just trash. Yeah, I feel like it's probably just become like content farm\""]

["05:37,280","05:42,680","\"Can you not hire a few people to just sift through like sit down and just sit through it huh time clock time clock? Oh?\""]

["06:36,920","06:39,320","\"Yeah, they're bad. They're evil, but then they go away for a sec\""]
["06:39,320","06:44,120","\"I always love how the sprites they can't move their hands because they're forever stuck teaposing\""]
["06:44,120","06:47,260","\"Yeah, but they just sort of like on June on July\""]

["06:54,240","06:56,820","\"How did you learn that if I do say a big word?\""]
["06:56,820","07:03,300","\"It's usually a choreified where I say the wrong version of it. Oh, that's very common. I can't help it like\""]
["07:03,300","07:07,060","\"I you should give me an example. I don't know\""]
["07:07,060","07:11,340","\"Like your word for develop is\""]
["07:11,340","07:14,900","\"Upy upy. Yeah\""]
["07:14,900","07:19,220","\"No, it would still be developed, but it would probably be like\""]

["11:16,160","11:21,580","\"So I don't know if there was like a fucking oh fuck break at the mental ward that day or something\""]
["11:21,580","11:26,760","\"But it was probably it was within the same hour. We saw both those things people probably got let out of prison that day\""]
["11:26,760","11:28,760","\"That's probably what happened\""]
["11:28,760","11:30,840","\"Do they just do that? Okay?\""]
["11:30,840","11:35,480","\"Yes, they just like release people want to get to full get out of prison for good behavior\""]
["11:36,760","11:42,360","\"That's probably what they do if you're a good a good little prison boy you get out early\""]
["11:42,360","11:47,620","\"So basically you can do whatever you like as long as you say sorry a lot\""]
["11:47,620","11:51,760","\"There's a giant mantis. Yes, you let me\""]
["11:51,760","11:55,520","\"So here's the thing Chris is level 15 and\""]
["11:55,520","12:00,560","\"He's got to kill enemies and that's where we are right now impressed\""]
["12:01,960","12:07,200","\"And this is the whole game like right now Chris isn't really attacking. He's just walking and all attacking is happening. I\""]

["12:09,960","12:11,960","\"Whip or damage\""]
["12:11,960","12:15,360","\"Whip you want to have a lot of whip okay\""]
["12:15,360","12:20,560","\"Because like if your whip is low you're not gonna be able to survive the dreaded boss fight\""]
["12:20,560","12:26,680","\"I really want there's this one item. It's like an orb you pick it up and it sucks all the coins in the game\""]

["12:31,320","12:36,520","\"Is this one of those games where it just lets you get really broken? Yes, it can yeah the game is really hard\""]
["12:36,520","12:41,620","\"So it's like yeah, it balances itself out. It's not like you know another game. That's really interesting is noita\""]
["12:41,620","12:48,020","\"I didn't really know about that. Oh yeah, so no Chris showed me it and Chris made some fucking insane broken runs like\""]
["12:48,020","12:53,840","\"Chris Chris made a run where he had a fucking he had him he had magic that created water\""]
["12:53,840","12:57,860","\"So he could flood the entire place then he also turned into electricity\""]
["12:57,860","13:01,260","\"So we could fucking murder and maim everybody and just melt face\""]
["13:01,260","13:05,040","\"But the only problem was Chris couldn't swim so he was stuck in his own hell\""]
["13:05,040","13:07,260","\"drowned and\""]
["13:07,260","13:13,660","\"Killed everything and another time like you had like this you could basically had an indefinite thing\""]

["16:00,200","16:07,080","\"That fucking scares me. Yeah, it sucks really bad. What is it the IRS? Oh\""]

["16:31,600","16:35,440","\"But I actually started to build my credit for the first time\""]
["16:35,440","16:42,420","\"I never really I had credit before when I was young but I ended up screwing myself and becoming a delinquent as far as like credit scores\""]
["16:42,420","16:45,940","\"Go and I fucked myself and that stuff doesn't go for go away for years, but\""]
["16:45,940","16:50,280","\"Recently I got a credit card and I was too afraid to use credit and like build credit\""]
["16:50,280","16:51,980","\"but then I\""]
["16:51,980","16:56,620","\"Needed a new bed because our my back was like fucked up and so I was like alright when you knew bed\""]
["16:56,620","17:02,460","\"It's way too expensive. I'm just gonna use a credit card and buy it and what credit essentially is is it's like\""]
["17:02,460","17:05,720","\"It just goes into a big money pile. I thought I would have to worry about a lot of stuff\""]
["17:05,720","17:09,020","\"But it basically goes into you only have a certain amount of limited money\""]
["17:09,020","17:11,840","\"It goes into them. I mean as long as you can pay it off\""]
["17:11,840","17:14,660","\"Exactly, but you don't have to pay it all off\""]
["17:14,660","17:17,940","\"You just have like they give you a certain percentage to pay off\""]
["17:17,940","17:20,240","\"They're like pay off like twenty five dollars a month\""]
["17:20,240","17:22,140","\"And then you just pay it off twenty five dollars a month\""]
["17:22,140","17:27,180","\"But I usually pay off like a hundred a month and when you do that and you don't pay it all off\""]
["17:27,180","17:29,180","\"You build credit really fast. Yes\""]
["17:30,180","17:35,180","\"That's one thing that I learned about credit. I don't know if this is the fucking forum for this\""]
["17:35,180","17:40,900","\"But one of the things I learned about credit because I had like kind of garbage credit\""]
["17:40,900","17:44,140","\"And I was like what the fuck like I was using my card and just paying it all off\""]
["17:44,140","17:45,060","\"Yeah, you don't want to do that\""]
["17:45,060","17:48,240","\"and then like I kind of got into some financial trouble and like\""]
["17:48,240","17:51,900","\"Let my credit kind of get shit and it accrued some fees\""]
["17:51,900","17:56,180","\"Yes, and then I started paying that off and then my credit went like way through the roof\""]
["17:56,180","18:02,500","\"So really yeah, it was like yeah, I was like are you shitting me like the time I fucked up is what built my credit exactly?\""]
["18:02,500","18:04,500","\"And that's how I learned it was all bullshit\""]
["18:04,500","18:06,500","\"It is all bullshit. It is all bullshit. It is bullshit. You know why?\""]
["18:06,500","18:11,060","\"Because I didn't have credit for like 10 years and then one year I had perfect credit. I don't understand\""]
["18:11,060","18:11,940","\"I don't even know what happened\""]
["18:11,940","18:15,540","\"I don't really get credit it has to do something like you're you it's bet\""]
["18:15,540","18:22,340","\"It's better to have worse credit because in the future you can get better credit because it's like they it's like you're in the system\""]
["18:22,340","18:26,340","\"I don't know how to explain it. I was a delinquent because I didn't pay off my-\""]
["18:26,340","18:29,340","\"Just make sure to fuck up early and then you'll be good.\""]
["18:29,340","18:33,340","\"Get delinquency so you fuck your credit up so you can't find any place to live.\""]
["18:33,340","18:35,340","\"Well, I'm gonna transfer water.\""]
["18:35,340","18:40,340","\"And then you can build your credit better and faster and that's how you hack the system.\""]
["18:40,340","18:43,340","\"No one's gonna take financial advice from you, Corey.\""]
["18:43,340","18:46,340","\"Why not? I'm a financial issue.\""]

["18:50,340","18:54,060","\"For sure for sure, but I think I think right now right now\""]
["18:54,060","18:57,700","\"This is like credit for dummies like I'm not telling you like what you should look\""]
["18:57,700","19:00,660","\"I'm just saying you need to tell you the rules you need to work out\""]
["19:00,660","19:05,460","\"You need to get buff and then you start you need to start having controversial opinions on Twitter\""]
["19:05,460","19:08,260","\"And then that's when you start like espousing these opinions\""]
["19:08,260","19:11,780","\"I can't do that and then someone will pay you like six hundred dollars a month for it\""]
["19:11,780","19:16,820","\"It's not worth it. Well, look at them go because like no one would believe me\""]
["19:17,620","19:22,820","\"They would if you were I believe you Corey no no you know what I love about this game. Oh, maybe they would\""]
["19:22,820","19:25,660","\"I love buff people with nice cars yet\""]
["19:25,660","19:31,480","\"I love how much shit is on screen, but I don't think that this would they wouldn't be able to do this with two players with so much shit on\""]
["19:31,480","19:35,640","\"Screen no this could not be done with two that's really sad because this would be so fun with two people\""]
["19:35,640","19:39,520","\"I think you guys are thinking pretty small. I think you could easily do this\""]
["19:39,520","19:44,180","\"I don't think you can because one more thing on screen get the crossbow\""]
["19:44,860","19:49,580","\"Well, then the game has to keep track of both things through or get the cross on both people's screens\""]
["19:49,580","19:53,420","\"And guess it's a lot of shit going on I\""]
["19:53,420","19:56,740","\"Do they do left for dead and shit\""]
["19:56,740","20:02,860","\"There's a lot of like trickery going on like a lot of the things like the ragdolling like props and shit\""]

["21:50,500","21:53,660","\"And then it's attached to a big thing that just spins around over and over\""]
["21:53,660","21:54,140","\"Oh, yeah\""]
["21:54,140","21:56,780","\"Like you go up and you pay like four euro to get on it\""]

["37:03,080","37:07,800","\"But it doesn't come can you please give me the digital code for this and she's like we don't have that and she's like\""]

["53:52,900","53:55,200","\"Consider this kind of not your queen away\""]

["54:03,640","54:09,540","\"Magic wand's pretty good, Corey. I mean, yeah, it is but you need to have a lot of them for it to be like really worth it\""]

["54:13,000","54:19,220","\"Chris, what do you see other players, but they're kind of annoying. It's better to have the whip you get a huge advantage\""]

["54:27,260","54:31,840","\"Crows waste more skill than me, but I love ooh\""]
["54:32,560","54:35,640","\"It's hard though. It is a bit odd in it\""]
["54:35,640","54:38,400","\"Fuck\""]
["54:38,400","54:40,240","\"What's wrong Corey?\""]
["54:40,240","54:45,120","\"Nothing I just had I just had a ran Iraq and I'm like exhausted from screaming about fucking stuff that\""]
["54:45,120","54:51,200","\"Like I don't do like driving and you got really passionate about that for someone doesn't drive\""]
["54:51,200","54:56,280","\"And I you know what as a driver. I appreciate it. I appreciate you as an ally\""]
["54:56,280","54:59,160","\"I mean, I just think it's like bullshit because it's like\""]
["55:00,040","55:07,020","\"It's like you you have to you spit all you have to do this fucking written test you have to pass with like a high score\""]
["55:07,020","55:12,120","\"And then after that you just go out and fucking never do the rules again like it's like it's just bullshit\""]
["55:12,120","55:15,120","\"Oh, I know I know I'm not saying like make a title app\""]
["55:15,120","55:21,620","\"But I'm saying like it would be really satisfying as people like that their cars just just locked up because they're being dickheads\""]
["55:21,620","55:26,040","\"And then they get in trouble because you're the one who's not being a dickhead. You're following the rules\""]
["55:26,040","55:29,020","\"You know fucking bad, you know, you know\""]
["55:29,020","55:33,580","\"Guilty until proven innocent you could have something like that a system like that. I\""]
["55:33,580","55:39,220","\"Want the garlic again Corey garlic is good early because you can take out all the bats\""]
["55:39,220","55:43,320","\"But then it's kind of useless. Yeah, then see useless then you want the Bible and shit\""]
["55:43,320","55:48,400","\"I was I was in a friend's Tesla recently. They are cool\""]
["55:48,400","55:53,660","\"They are cool, but they have like a self-driving thing. Yeah, and I\""]
["55:53,660","55:56,540","\"Was like dude\""]
["55:56,540","56:01,600","\"Your Tesla drives like a dick does it kind of a little bit it drives fine\""]
["56:01,600","56:07,000","\"You know I personally like them. I know people have their gripes. I think their gripes are more with the guy\""]
["56:07,000","56:09,840","\"Not what I mean like I'm not to that's a say anything\""]
["56:09,840","56:14,080","\"But I do think like electric cars are good considering how fuck gas is like gas is fuck\""]
["56:14,080","56:18,520","\"I can see both ways now because like the power grids are like turning on and off everywhere\""]
["56:18,520","56:22,180","\"So that's not good maybe like your cars is not gonna fix that\""]
["56:23,340","56:29,460","\"It's because we fucking hate like upgrading infrastructure. Yeah every single time like something bad happens\""]
["56:29,460","56:33,980","\"We're like we should fix this and then like the thing bad stops happening for a little bit\""]
["56:33,980","56:38,220","\"And we're like it will never happen again. Maybe everyone should just get hybrid\""]
["56:38,220","56:44,400","\"When I was touring like gas was like a hundred and forty for like 400 like miles\""]
["56:44,400","56:50,820","\"And it was it added up fast 400 miles really isn't that much when you're touring and driving for like fucking nine straight hours\""]
["56:50,860","56:54,820","\"That's like 700 dollars just to get to your next venue. It's fucking really expensive\""]
["56:54,820","57:01,160","\"Yeah, so you know take it with grain and salt gas isn't that great, but I mean if it was electric\""]
["57:01,160","57:06,880","\"I don't know what it would have been like an electric man. It isn't anything those exists electric tour vans. I\""]
["57:06,880","57:09,520","\"won my or\""]
["57:09,520","57:14,820","\"Why do you want it so you can get a benefit what you actually used a tour van really yeah?\""]
["57:14,820","57:23,300","\"It wasn't no oh, I could say this I was gonna I was and say this but um enterprise you ever heard of enterprise\""]
["57:23,300","57:26,180","\"Yeah, they suck. They're the worst enterprise\""]
["57:26,180","57:35,700","\"If don't ever use enterprise for bands. They have all this like bullshit like stuff meant to fuck you over like they're they're unfair\""]
["57:35,700","57:37,940","\"honestly like\""]
["57:37,940","57:44,380","\"To explain how bad enterprise is they're like not not all enterprises are the same\""]
["57:44,380","57:50,780","\"Some enterprises are different. It just depends on where you go. You know, it's a luck of the draw and another thing about enterprise is\""]
["57:50,780","57:53,260","\"It's first come first surf\""]
["57:53,260","57:58,420","\"If you know if you see a van you like and you can't get it then in there if someone shows up and gets it\""]
["57:58,420","58:02,100","\"You're not getting that van. They will not save you a van. Wow\""]
["58:02,100","58:08,700","\"So we we wanted a van. It was the perfect van. It was slightly better than the one we had but because we went there\""]
["58:10,100","58:17,060","\"Apparently like Dylan was gonna buy it, but you have to be like 21 years old and or no you have to have\""]
["58:17,060","58:23,500","\"Sorry your credit has to be like I forget what it was it was like your credit has to be\""]
["58:23,500","58:28,180","\"3000 Dylan and have 3000 as credit. He was just building his credit. I don't think that's not a real number\""]
["58:28,180","58:35,000","\"No, this is true. That's not the right number. No good credit is like 750. No no for a credit card\""]
["58:35,000","58:37,000","\"You needed a\""]
["58:37,300","58:38,260","\"Oh, I see, I see.\""]
["58:38,260","58:39,260","\"- No, no, yeah, no.\""]
["58:39,260","58:41,200","\"Good credit is between a thousand, right?\""]
["58:41,200","58:42,040","\"I don't know.\""]
["58:42,040","58:44,980","\"- I was like, yeah, we just made that fucking like meme sound.\""]
["58:44,980","58:45,820","\"- Oh!\""]
["58:45,820","58:48,660","\"But I'd see.\""]
["58:48,660","58:51,340","\"- Yeah, so he went there and he didn't have a credit card\""]
["58:51,340","58:53,820","\"to do that, so he had to get his mom to go out there.\""]
["58:53,820","58:56,940","\"But before that, we had another member\""]
["58:56,940","58:58,700","\"who did have enough credit,\""]
["58:58,700","59:02,340","\"but he wasn't old enough because apparently\""]
["59:02,340","59:04,460","\"it's not 21, I think it's like 25.\""]
["59:04,460","59:05,460","\"Yeah, it's 25.\""]
["59:05,460","59:07,140","\"You have to be 25 years old.\""]
["59:07,140","59:07,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["59:07,660","59:12,020","\"Which doesn't make any sense, because you can be 18 and buy cigarettes,\""]
["59:12,020","59:15,260","\"but you can't be 25 years old and rent a fucking van.\""]
["59:15,260","59:17,860","\"You can die in a war for your country.\""]
["59:17,860","59:19,340","\"Yeah, exactly.\""]
["59:19,340","59:20,100","\"But you can't.\""]
["59:20,100","59:21,700","\"It's just that makes no sense.\""]
["59:21,700","59:25,540","\"But here's another thing too, is it's different where you are.\""]
["59:25,540","59:28,140","\"They didn't say that on the website when Dylan went there,\""]
["59:28,140","59:30,740","\"they didn't say anything about the age requirement for credit.\""]
["59:30,740","59:33,260","\"They said they said that after he went there,\""]
["59:33,460","59:37,160","\"So when he went to get his mom, we wasted time and the van we wanted was gone.\""]
["59:37,160","59:38,160","\"That sucks.\""]
["59:38,160","59:42,500","\"And another thing that's fucked up is they have certain times when you can drop the car\""]
["59:42,500","59:46,300","\"off and if you go over it, they'll overcharge you for it.\""]
["59:46,300","59:49,740","\"And the worst part is you can't drop it off over that time.\""]
["59:49,740","59:54,060","\"If you don't get it in with that time window, they count it as the next day.\""]
["59:54,060","59:57,940","\"So we missed it by like two hours and they were like, okay, pay off $500 fee because you\""]
["59:57,940","59:58,940","\"were late an hour.\""]
["59:58,940","01:00:02,300","\"It's like, but since we were touring, it's like, how the fuck were you gonna plan that\""]
["01:00:02,300","01:00:03,300","\"ahead?\""]
["01:00:03,300","01:00:08,060","\"We told them we warned them and they were just like you you have to be here within a certain hour\""]
["01:00:08,060","01:00:13,600","\"But they're fucking bank hours were like from three to five. It's like how is supposed to get here within the fucking\""]
["01:00:13,600","01:00:16,660","\"Your three hour time period are you fucking kidding me?\""]
["01:00:16,660","01:00:24,260","\"So they screwed us up doing that so enterprise sucks if you can find a tour van anywhere else do not use enterprise\""]
["01:00:24,260","01:00:28,180","\"Another thing too is when we got the van they had all these like things\""]
["01:00:28,180","01:00:32,420","\"It's like do you want to pay twelve dollars for like I don't know like an insurance price\""]
["01:00:32,420","01:00:35,340","\"You want to pay $150 for to ensure all the items in the van?\""]
["01:00:35,340","01:00:39,500","\"Do you want to pay like a hundred and fifty dollars for us to clean your windows?\""]
["01:00:39,500","01:00:41,600","\"Do you want like fifty dollars will suck your dick?\""]
["01:00:41,600","01:00:46,600","\"It's like all this fucking money prices on the given you was like going down an iPad and it was just like\""]
["01:00:46,600","01:00:52,120","\"Telling up and it's like I guess we want all this stuff. It's like dude. We're not made of money motherfucker. We're trying to tour here. Yeah\""]
["01:00:52,120","01:00:56,820","\"It's sorry. No, that's just the start of the tour\""]
["01:00:56,820","01:00:58,340","\"I have more stories with the tour\""]
["01:00:58,340","01:01:02,660","\"But I don't want to get into that to like I want to like spread that out like as we're like doing more things\""]
["01:01:02,660","01:01:05,620","\"I'm gonna spread you out. Yeah pink piece of ass\""]
["01:01:05,620","01:01:08,660","\"But yeah touring was fun, but like the tour van was not\""]
["01:01:08,660","01:01:12,940","\"And like I wish it was bigger and we wanted a bigger one\""]
["01:01:12,940","01:01:17,100","\"But we didn't get some dickhead they had like five of them and they were all gone by the time we got here\""]
["01:01:17,100","01:01:22,340","\"The only one we could get was like the smallest one basically and we had to make it work\""]
