["02:32,840","02:37,000","\"Maybe you can hit it with the bomb. No, I'm never gonna get out of here Tomar\""]
["02:37,000","02:42,720","\"This is a really good first. This is the worst first game. I didn't even know you could go left. I've never tried\""]
["02:44,480","02:48,640","\"Honest engine or just spit up some yellow stuff seeing that that's it now. I'm dead\""]
["02:48,640","02:51,360","\"There's a little burst of little pieces of it too. That's the end of that\""]
["02:51,360","02:53,200","\"With a start a new one\""]
["02:53,200","02:56,840","\"It's a regular regular old-timey burp if that's true\""]
["02:56,840","02:59,280","\"Then why are there little why are there little brown pieces inside the yellow?\""]
["02:59,280","03:06,560","\"Actually disgusting see this is how every game starts off you go into the cave and now we're in the cave\""]
["03:06,560","03:10,600","\"And this is sort of a standard game. What on earth is that? It's a minecart\""]
["03:10,600","03:13,080","\"You can kick it\""]
["03:13,080","03:18,500","\"What are these glowing that's just the tutorial yeah, it's just telling you what the controls are so now this is a game\""]
["03:18,500","03:20,500","\"We're in the we're in the cave world\""]
["03:20,500","03:24,160","\"The mind is gonna zap those little those little oh\""]
["03:24,160","03:30,140","\"You're probably good things are these I actually don't know I call them little golems\""]
["03:30,140","03:33,360","\"But they don't really look like golem they cut our little golems\""]
["03:33,360","03:38,640","\"So yeah, this is the first level. It's just the mine area and there's like gold and there's like\""]
["03:38,980","03:43,260","\"Yeah, there's effects it like every pixel is like simulated physics\""]
["03:43,260","03:51,820","\"So there's like like you notice how it creates smoke and the smoke gathers near the top and you got the structural environments like worms\""]
["03:51,820","03:57,240","\"That it I always like that in the game. I know blow something up take pieces out of something\""]
["03:57,240","04:01,980","\"I think this is one of the most satisfying games ever played now. I maybe there is the objective\""]
["04:01,980","04:04,180","\"But what's the objective of this game just keep going down?\""]
["04:04,180","04:10,740","\"Yeah, it's one of those games where it just each level introduces like new enemies and environments that it's just\""]
["04:10,740","04:15,400","\"But but but the the actual layouts different every time you play and it's all\""]
["04:15,400","04:21,060","\"Okay, so just to make sure it's\""]
["04:21,060","04:24,420","\"Absolutely, that's great\""]
["04:24,420","04:30,020","\"It's kind of scary. Oh, oh look does a wand down there and I'm stuck that guys like buried in gunpowder\""]
["04:30,140","04:35,440","\"Yeah, I don't even want a fucking bother. So this is the whole point whenever you see a shiny shine like that that means there's a wand\""]
["04:35,440","04:40,900","\"And that's what you're looking to get yeah, you can have up to four ones now. I got a new wand now\""]
["04:40,900","04:46,140","\"I can oh look it's fire. It's a flame one. What's the guy? I think it's a flame torch. It's just\""]
["04:46,140","04:52,100","\"So he could later add more spells to it, but right now all it really is is a torch\""]
["04:52,100","04:57,460","\"Can I light stuff like that? I bet you can go up to like something flammable like a piece of grass\""]
["04:57,460","04:59,220","\"I need like, yeah gunpowder.\""]
["04:59,220","05:00,060","\"- Oh, you just stand under it.\""]
["05:00,060","05:02,140","\"- Oh, oh, oh, you let yourself.\""]
["05:02,140","05:04,660","\"- So he's got a little flask of water,\""]
["05:04,660","05:06,420","\"so he just splashed himself with water\""]
["05:06,420","05:07,740","\"to put himself out.\""]
["05:07,740","05:08,740","\"- Isn't that cool?\""]
["05:08,740","05:09,700","\"What's that?\""]
["05:09,700","05:12,500","\"- Yeah, be careful around gunpowder with that thing.\""]
["05:12,500","05:13,940","\"- I don't think that, I think that's just dirt.\""]
["05:13,940","05:16,300","\"- I think you're right that it's just dirt.\""]
["05:16,300","05:17,700","\"And then there's blood, and there's water,\""]
["05:17,700","05:19,380","\"so you know I got blood and water on me?\""]
["05:19,380","05:21,140","\"- What does blood do to him, Mar?\""]
["05:21,140","05:22,260","\"- On, wait, it's on you?\""]
["05:22,260","05:23,100","\"- Yeah.\""]
["05:23,100","05:24,460","\"- I actually don't know.\""]
["05:24,460","05:26,300","\"Like you were the one with the theory\""]
["05:26,300","05:29,340","\"that it makes certain enemies angry if you have blood on you.\""]
["05:29,340","05:30,980","\"That's just what I assumed it would do.\""]
["05:30,980","05:32,180","\"But I actually don't know.\""]
["05:32,180","05:35,180","\"[MUSIC PLAYING]\""]
["05:35,180","05:40,900","\"Look, there's an iron over it.\""]
["05:40,900","05:42,980","\"I've never read up on it.\""]
["05:42,980","05:43,780","\"Treasure.\""]
["05:43,780","05:45,020","\"Ooh, that's our big treasure chest.\""]
["05:45,020","05:45,900","\"I know it's gold here.\""]
["05:45,900","05:46,420","\"I'm going to put it--\""]
["05:46,420","05:47,880","\"Don't prevent you from just putting a bomb right here\""]
["05:47,880","05:49,060","\"blowing down right below you.\""]
["05:49,060","05:49,420","\"I can.\""]
["05:49,420","05:50,580","\"I'm not going to do that.\""]
["05:50,580","05:52,820","\"Oh.\""]
["05:52,820","05:54,740","\"And then there's gold.\""]
["05:54,740","05:55,420","\"Line and fire.\""]
["05:55,420","05:55,920","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:55,920","05:57,920","\"Yes! He burned the fucking eyeball.\""]
["05:57,920","06:02,920","\"Stupid eyeball. He's gonna die probably. He's gonna take you with him.\""]
["06:02,920","06:05,920","\"Look he's leaking green. Oh there he passed out.\""]
["06:05,920","06:07,920","\"Gold! Gold! Give him my gold!\""]
["06:07,920","06:09,920","\"Your greed made you fall out of the fire.\""]
["06:09,920","06:11,920","\"But yeah when he's got... Oh fuck!\""]
["06:11,920","06:16,920","\"See if he had water on his clothes. It wouldn't have caught fire.\""]
["06:16,920","06:19,920","\"Ooh! Look at all this gold, Omar.\""]
["06:19,920","06:21,920","\"Nice. You got 200 already.\""]
["06:21,920","06:24,920","\"Under some gold right here next to a wand.\""]
["06:24,920","06:28,880","\"Also, we have a couple bombs left. What do you do with gold? What is that? What does that let you do?\""]
["06:28,880","06:32,160","\"So at the end of this level there's gonna be a store that you can spend oh\""]
["06:32,160","06:39,120","\"There's another new one. What does this one do? It's another torch. It's another torch. Does it fire? Nope?\""]
["06:39,120","06:41,320","\"Look, he's got a floppy cape\""]
["06:41,320","06:43,160","\"Yeah\""]
["06:43,160","06:49,780","\"And that's pretty much the whole game. He's got a floppy cape. Yeah, so it's left trigger is the is both jump and fly\""]
["06:49,780","06:54,280","\"It's the same button. Oh fuck basically holding it just makes you keep going up until\""]
["06:54,280","06:59,280","\"until you run out of, see those meters in the top right, Zach.\""]
["06:59,280","07:01,640","\"First one's obviously health.\""]
["07:01,640","07:03,880","\"The second one is like your jump power,\""]
["07:03,880","07:06,360","\"so you can shoot up until that runs out.\""]
["07:06,360","07:08,260","\"It's like your jet pack, basically.\""]
["07:08,260","07:12,800","\"And then the third one is, what is the third one?\""]
["07:12,800","07:15,920","\"Oh, that's just mana, which your standard thing\""]
["07:15,920","07:17,760","\"doesn't really spend very quickly,\""]
["07:17,760","07:20,280","\"but some of the more powerful spells\""]
["07:20,280","07:21,760","\"will drain that really fast,\""]
["07:21,760","07:23,480","\"and then you have to wait for it to recharge.\""]
["07:23,480","07:28,020","\"What are the rules of flying around like if you how lucky you fly around for as long as that orange bar\""]
["07:28,020","07:33,920","\"Has something in it you can fly. Oh, I see and it recharges as soon as you stop using it\""]
["07:33,920","07:38,460","\"Yeah, the first level is kind of mostly about just getting gold so you can spend it at the store\""]
["07:38,460","07:45,400","\"Now we're not gonna be any gold member references. We've been a pack to the beginning. Oh, there's a wand right there. What is that? Yeah?\""]
["07:45,400","07:50,640","\"I want that. Oh, look all this gold right here. I'm gonna get all this shit, right?\""]
["07:50,640","07:53,200","\"No, come back bomb\""]
["07:53,200","07:59,840","\"Look at all that fucking gold. Oh, I see so it's also built into the ground. Yeah, blow it out of the fucking earth\""]
["07:59,840","08:02,900","\"Yeah, sometimes you get stuck in it. It's kind of shit\""]
["08:02,900","08:10,080","\"If it's closer certain things can coax it out. Okay. I don't need two torches. Oh, that's a bomb, too\""]
["08:10,080","08:14,080","\"Is it yeah, that's like some cut I think it's glitter bomb. What whoa?\""]
["08:14,080","08:19,040","\"Look at that. It's not as strong as a real bomb. That's fucking it\""]
["08:19,720","08:23,400","\"But yeah, that's the glitter bomb spell I could throw one of those to my GF\""]
["08:23,400","08:28,320","\"Wait, wait, we can go mining with this now. Just get a bunch of gold. We could try\""]
["08:28,320","08:33,120","\"Spider what is this? Oh\""]
["08:33,120","08:38,840","\"There's a guy would a guy that's a big shotgun big big. Do you see that big big big big eyeball boy?\""]
["08:38,840","08:42,040","\"That's a big he's use the glitter bombs on you oh\""]
["08:42,040","08:49,520","\"That caught him. Yeah, she did you blew his fucking rocks get blast that guy directly with the bomb\""]
["08:49,520","08:51,520","\"Oh\""]
["08:51,520","08:54,840","\"He's a going up and down\""]
["08:54,840","08:58,480","\"Oh, no, he's still living\""]
["08:58,480","09:07,240","\"He's making little babies. Oh shit. Look at all and they're all dropping toxic sled. He died. He's dead\""]
["09:07,240","09:13,000","\"Yeah, he drew I think he's dropping acid. Oh is that straight acid? Yeah, that hurts you way faster\""]
["09:14,400","09:19,640","\"Look at the gas going on fire. I fucking love this remember powder game. Did you ever see that? No?\""]
["09:19,640","09:21,960","\"It was a it was a browser kind of a thing\""]
["09:21,960","09:26,960","\"That it just had different particles like this, but they this is like they made a game out of it. So cool\""]
["09:26,960","09:34,140","\"How different is it to do particle effects for something like this where it's like a flat 2d platform reverses?\""]
["09:34,140","09:42,340","\"I honestly think it's pretty complicated a game like this no no no like each pixel like has its own like material and physics\""]
["09:43,340","09:50,320","\"I have a feeling this was coded from scratch, but I could be wrong. Maybe this was game maker. Oh fuck no\""]
["09:50,320","09:56,420","\"Or some or unity or some other comment. This is make go ahead of it dude this sucks\""]
["09:56,420","10:03,060","\"Okay, fuck no just go for go for the fucking exit go for the exit. You still have 20 now. You have 20 out\""]
["10:03,060","10:05,060","\"You'll make it oh\""]
["10:05,060","10:09,420","\"Oh, no, oh good get in the water go get the water trying\""]
["10:11,380","10:18,560","\"What did that do what was wrong? He was poisoned the water will rinse off fire and and acid and stuff. She's\""]
["10:18,560","10:22,940","\"Look we can buy stuff now though. All right, so this is stuff you can put on your wand\""]
["10:22,940","10:28,920","\"You could buy like everything if you wanted. I wish you could buy multiple fireballs. There's 15 fireball\""]
["10:28,920","10:32,020","\"scatter spell\""]
["10:32,020","10:34,020","\"circle displacement\""]
["10:34,020","10:40,380","\"Circle of stillness. I personally do like a real illness make everything around you freeze or something\""]
["10:40,380","10:42,140","\"What is that dude try we got lots of money?\""]
["10:42,140","10:48,320","\"Rain cloud now we got all sorts of stuff. So these are the ones that we picked up\""]
["10:48,320","10:51,700","\"16 dude this rocks\""]
["10:51,700","10:55,820","\"Revenge explosion\""]

["11:04,540","11:09,780","\"I don't want to blow myself up. Yeah, that sounds dangerous. I think it's like a kavakazi boomerang spells\""]
["11:09,780","11:14,640","\"I also don't want it. I could be totally wrong about that. Yeah boomerang spells could be weird. These are all shit\""]
["11:14,640","11:16,980","\"I'll just do more love I guess\""]
["11:16,980","11:20,840","\"Creatures in the world are more friendly toward each other. What?\""]
["11:20,840","11:23,420","\"Why would I want to do that? Yeah\""]
["11:23,420","11:29,620","\"Do they do the little a little David's usually attack each other? Yeah, they can do\""]
["11:29,620","11:33,120","\"Look, I killed the rest. So now they're less likely to\""]
["11:33,940","11:36,340","\"Definitely not beneficial to the player. I\""]
["11:36,340","11:44,300","\"Just try to get oh my god though. I was trying to get the gold out\""]
["11:44,300","11:51,820","\"With the beautiful gold right beneath you. Yeah, okay. This isn't very this is a random direction. It shoots out. I\""]
["11:51,820","11:55,500","\"Think that's part of its split feature\""]
["11:55,500","11:59,220","\"Should I try to get that one?\""]
["11:59,220","12:04,420","\"You get the damn one. You could but it'll be easier with the real bomb.\""]
