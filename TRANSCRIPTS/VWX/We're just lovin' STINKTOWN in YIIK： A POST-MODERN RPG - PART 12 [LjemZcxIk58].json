["01:53,200","01:55,920","\"Michael say something. It's been a while. Are you okay?\""]
["01:55,920","01:58,120","\"He's got duct tape over his mouth.\""]
["01:58,120","02:03,000","\"It's funny that the last cutscene they even say Michael's been\""]
["02:03,000","02:04,160","\"having to get pretty well.\""]
["02:04,160","02:08,280","\"He's just so sweet. It's like the scene with Marge where she\""]
["02:08,280","02:11,240","\"she's sitting, but she's not on the couch anymore. Oh, yeah.\""]
["02:11,240","02:15,280","\"What would you say Rory adds to the group, Julian?\""]
["02:15,280","02:20,520","\"He's the sad one.\""]
["02:21,440","02:24,600","\"I guess he's the realist of the bunch.\""]
["02:24,600","02:26,600","\"- Michael was like the comic relief\""]
["02:26,600","02:28,520","\"for the time that they were using him.\""]
["02:28,520","02:31,600","\"He said goofy things.\""]
["02:31,600","02:32,520","\"- But then he died.\""]
["02:32,520","02:35,720","\"- And had a bizarre fixation on age.\""]
["02:35,720","02:37,680","\"- Yeah, he really does, doesn't he?\""]
["02:37,680","02:41,000","\"- And you could have done something with that.\""]
["02:41,000","02:43,320","\"You could have probably went into like his own insecurities\""]

["02:45,120","02:46,120","\"Does he not?\""]
["02:46,120","02:46,960","\"No.\""]
["02:46,960","02:47,800","\"- I don't think so.\""]
["02:47,800","02:49,920","\"- No, they kind of forgot he's here.\""]
["02:49,920","02:52,120","\"Is it like that for the rest of the game that they never used to be?\""]
["02:52,120","02:57,280","\"They used him again around the end, but no, there's like a big window where they kind of forgot he's there.\""]
["02:57,280","03:01,020","\"Or you have to have a comment like that like, \"\"Oh yeah, Michael's here too.\"\"\""]
["03:01,020","03:04,360","\"He's in the back and he silently waves.\""]
["03:04,360","03:07,760","\"Maybe he couldn't get enough voice clips from him? I don't know.\""]
["03:07,760","03:14,500","\"Like that's what I keep thinking about too is like, is it just because he couldn't get the voice actors to get all the lines he needed?\""]
["03:14,500","03:17,640","\"Did he get them to record lines that he didn't want to really use anymore?\""]
["03:17,980","03:23,780","\"It's really weird looking at this game and like trying to analyze what it is and why it happened the way it did.\""]
["03:23,780","03:30,960","\"Strategy, look at that. Oh, he's back. Oh, he's here. What are you doing here? Oh, you're wanting for you every week.\""]
["03:30,960","03:39,140","\"How many times will I die? One more? Lemonade. What? I'm just bringing him some lemonade.\""]
["03:39,140","03:45,500","\"I found some. I found some. What is that? That's lemonade. It looks like an enemy. I think it is an enemy.\""]
["03:45,500","03:49,860","\"Oh, maybe these shadows aren't exactly helping. Yeah, what is the readability?\""]
["03:49,860","03:53,420","\"How the fuck did they fuck that up? I'm gonna take this tip Chris\""]
["03:53,420","03:57,660","\"If somebody asked you a question, so you're ugly\""]
["03:57,660","04:03,500","\"What is that question? Yeah, that's how you keep conversation rolling. I'm honest. I don't understand\""]
["04:03,500","04:06,940","\"What did it say specifically ask them a question back? Yes\""]
["04:06,940","04:10,660","\"That is how you keep a conversation going\""]
["04:10,660","04:13,220","\"Somebody says, how are you to go?\""]
["04:13,220","04:15,480","\"- For you, I asked first.\""]
["04:15,480","04:17,740","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:17,740","04:21,180","\"- And then they go, I'm, I guess I'm okay.\""]
["04:21,180","04:23,100","\"And you go, are you?\""]
["04:23,100","04:25,020","\"- I guess I'm okay too then.\""]
["04:25,020","04:28,340","\"- Or am I, you tell me.\""]
["04:28,340","04:29,300","\"- You tell me.\""]
["04:29,300","04:31,740","\"- I think, oh wow, you really know\""]
["04:31,740","04:33,900","\"how to keep this conversation going.\""]
["04:33,900","04:35,060","\"He's kind of cool.\""]
["04:35,060","04:37,040","\"We've never been to social before.\""]
["04:37,040","04:39,780","\"- That's a good point.\""]
["04:39,780","04:41,340","\"That is exactly what I do.\""]
["04:41,340","04:42,420","\"- How's your family doing?\""]
["04:42,420","04:46,600","\"Your family doing I'm gonna be a pacifist right here\""]

["04:58,380","05:01,820","\"I was trying to think of a death pun\""]
["05:01,820","05:04,100","\"I couldn't do it in time\""]
["05:04,100","05:09,460","\"You should you should freestyle Chris. Yeah, my name is Rory. Yeah, give me the e crap\""]
["05:09,460","05:16,560","\"My name is Rory. My sister is no mori. She got out of my story. Now I'm bored\""]
["05:16,560","05:24,020","\"I met a guy called Alex his hair is really nice. I\""]
["05:24,020","05:27,900","\"Met a boy called Michael his pants are on too tight. I\""]

["05:33,260","05:36,460","\"These fashions by the way these are not 90s\""]
["05:36,660","05:41,820","\"The the year has been completely incidental to the game so far. I met a girl called Vela\""]
["05:41,820","05:48,540","\"I think she needs a fella who looks like me, but it is not as so smelly named Chris O'Neill\""]
["05:48,540","05:55,160","\"He did say he smelled earlier. I was rapping from the perspective of our protagonist\""]
["05:55,160","05:58,880","\"It's true because if you were rapping from the perspective of Michael you wouldn't say anything\""]
["05:58,880","06:05,140","\"I win I did it no you did it Michael\""]
["06:05,140","06:07,140","\"You didn't do anything.\""]
["06:07,140","06:12,060","\"Like whatever he's dead he has like his hands under his head. He's just\""]
["06:12,060","06:17,500","\"Quit following us. Hey, what do you want?\""]
["06:17,500","06:29,780","\"Almost there it's embarrassing it sounds like somebody whose voice is not naturally deep doing a deep inflection\""]
["06:29,780","06:32,460","\"Probably what he told them is like can you just sound deeper with your voice?\""]
["06:34,300","06:37,020","\"I am almost there.\""]
["06:37,020","06:40,020","\"- To only one of you know, he sounds like he's 50 years old\""]
["06:40,020","06:40,860","\"and he's really cool.\""]
["06:40,860","06:42,420","\"- He sounds like he's 90 years old\""]
["06:42,420","06:44,300","\"and he's even cooler than just cool.\""]
["06:44,300","06:45,660","\"- Can I do that?\""]
["06:45,660","06:47,820","\"(screaming)\""]
["06:47,820","06:49,340","\"That's a platform.\""]
["06:49,340","06:51,140","\"- By the way, none of this was in the original game.\""]
["06:51,140","06:52,500","\"This is all new stuff.\""]
["06:52,500","06:54,980","\"- Good. It needed more sewer action.\""]
