["07:14,320","07:18,960","\"Six hundred thousand dollars, but you have to release a robo mouse which when once activated\""]
["07:18,960","07:25,880","\"Well, we'll we'll infinitely just keep going so we're talking fights find somebody and it does like into the burrows into them\""]
["07:25,880","07:30,240","\"Okay, can you kill each them? Okay, dig into them. Yeah, does it make sense?\""]
["07:30,240","07:37,160","\"So you're telling me the the businessman the fat-stacks businessman with a golden cane walks up big gold\""]

["07:55,200","08:01,000","\"900,000 I don't think I do that for literally infinite money because I just feel too guilty\""]
["08:01,000","08:04,920","\"Yeah, plus you'd assume that the next person who gets the offer the mouse would burrow into you\""]
["08:05,280","08:09,200","\"Like that fucking button movie remember the button movie. What's the button movie?\""]
["08:09,200","08:13,160","\"It's like the guy shows up. He's like I have this button and if you press the button\""]

["08:23,560","08:29,160","\"Yeah, I can do that and then blatantly the twist is I don't even know for a fact that that's the twist\""]
["08:29,160","08:34,720","\"That's just what I assume it was is that if you press the button the next person that gets it is you\""]
["08:34,720","08:39,940","\"You know like if someone else pushes the button I'd feel a little awkward about doing that\""]
["08:39,940","08:43,380","\"Yeah, well then don't push the button or do the mouse thing\""]
["08:43,380","08:47,760","\"Why would you do that if if one random person died, but you also?\""]
["08:47,760","08:50,100","\"you killed\""]
["08:50,100","08:51,620","\"three\""]

["09:17,420","09:21,660","\"Yeah, but then they get to die from a robo mouse. It's just pretty cool. You're letting the chimps out\""]
