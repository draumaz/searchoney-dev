["26:27,960","26:28,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["26:28,960","26:31,800","\"At Joffrey's birthday?\""]
["26:31,800","26:32,800","\"Do they have accordions?\""]
["26:32,800","26:35,800","\"They have this big huge machine that sounds like one that sounds really cool.\""]
["26:35,800","26:38,480","\"I don't know what it is.\""]
["26:38,480","26:40,640","\"But all I'm saying is that I like accordions.\""]
["26:40,640","26:43,200","\"Yeah, accordions are cool.\""]
["26:43,200","26:45,800","\"I've been playing a lot of Sea of Thieves lately.\""]
["26:45,800","26:46,800","\"Oh yeah.\""]
["26:46,800","26:51,800","\"And you get like, it's got this kind of cool system where you can like play music with\""]
["26:51,800","26:52,800","\"each other.\""]
["26:52,800","26:57,240","\"You can take lead and rhythm and stuff depending on who starts the song.\""]
["26:57,240","26:58,240","\"That's sick.\""]
["26:58,240","27:01,240","\"If you stop playing, someone else will take lead and shit.\""]
["27:01,240","27:06,040","\"Point is one of those musical instruments you can use is an accordion.\""]
["27:06,040","27:09,520","\"There's an accordion of banjo, a herdie, girdy, and a drum.\""]
["27:09,520","27:12,080","\"I love that shit and it's yeah, it's real cool.\""]
["27:12,080","27:16,800","\"For some reason, all my Irish side of the family have accordions and they're all masters\""]

["27:17,800","27:19,320","\"That's sick.\""]
["27:19,320","27:21,320","\"All my uncles and my granddad.\""]
["27:21,320","27:24,000","\"I wonder if that's a difficult instrument to play.\""]
["27:24,000","27:26,840","\"It is. I mean, like all instruments are difficult to play.\""]
["27:26,840","27:31,240","\"I can't think of any instrument that's easy, that sounds any good.\""]
["27:31,240","27:33,960","\"Nah. I mean, the kazoo.\""]
["27:33,960","27:40,800","\"Exactly. It's like the kazoo and the jaw harp and like symbols and...\""]
["27:40,800","27:42,400","\"not symbols.\""]
["27:42,400","27:45,280","\"The things with the little...\""]

["27:47,080","27:48,040","\"Oh, tambourine?\""]
["27:48,040","27:49,920","\"Tambourine, that's what I was thinking of.\""]
["27:49,920","27:51,400","\"Yeah, but you can't play music with those.\""]
["27:51,400","27:52,220","\"You can just make it--\""]
["27:52,220","27:53,440","\"- That's my point. - Vote beat with them.\""]
["27:53,440","27:56,880","\"- That thing's just like a rhythm thing and like a jar.\""]
["27:56,880","27:58,480","\"It's like, it might sound cool\""]
["27:58,480","28:00,160","\"accompanying other instruments,\""]
["28:00,160","28:03,640","\"but it's not really much of an instrument in itself.\""]
["28:03,640","28:05,320","\"Same with like a kazoo,\""]
["28:05,320","28:07,920","\"'cause these are just kind of annoying.\""]
["28:07,920","28:09,400","\"You see where I'm going with this, right?\""]
["28:09,400","28:10,240","\"- Yeah, yeah.\""]

["28:17,920","28:20,320","\"They just go, they all go purely on instinct.\""]
["28:20,320","28:23,880","\"- I think honestly that's where you get it from.\""]
["28:23,880","28:26,080","\"- That's kinda common.\""]
["28:26,080","28:27,320","\"- No, I know, but it's just so,\""]
["28:27,320","28:29,520","\"it's crazy to me that that can even happen.\""]
["28:29,520","28:34,680","\"It's like, my cousins are like learning from their dads\""]

["38:58,240","39:01,540","\"See it now and now he's grown\""]
["39:01,540","39:06,040","\"It's been over five years since we were here\""]
["39:06,040","39:12,140","\"We've grown so much in that time and everyone we know is dead the song's catchy\""]
["39:12,140","39:17,740","\"It's really strange hearing a piano with no reverb on it now\""]
["39:18,980","39:24,740","\"Yeah, it's just really like dry, but it's not a bad thing look we get the water in this reminds me of\""]
["39:24,740","39:28,420","\"I've been trying to figure out what the fuck this music reminds me of\""]
["39:28,420","39:33,780","\"But there's this game called fucking like something or other on the Obra Dan. Yes. Yeah\""]
["39:33,780","39:39,780","\"Yeah, that game is really good return to the Obra Dan or yeah return of Obra Dan or something\""]
["39:39,780","39:44,520","\"That's a good game play a viewer. We're probably not gonna play it on here. It's too\""]
["39:44,900","39:50,100","\"It's - you have to think way too hard and we can't do that. It's true. You really do look at that\""]
["39:50,100","39:54,860","\"That's a game. You shouldn't do on a let's play. Honestly. It's like you should get invested in it and enjoy it\""]
["39:54,860","39:59,220","\"Yeah, not it actually rocks. Oh my god. Where does this need to go?\""]
["39:59,220","40:02,020","\"Feed it. He's thirsty\""]
["40:02,020","40:09,120","\"He does have like a big open like mouth. I think or either that or you're just supposed to connect it to the other tube\""]
["40:09,120","40:14,580","\"That's also I don't know but oh they're - I think is the fueling - oh no, it's not connected to him\""]
["40:14,580","40:20,100","\"Yeah, you can get in his back and his back see that little like yeah, you think it's that little this thing\""]
["40:20,100","40:24,940","\"No, I think it's that thing this thing the other tube you connect those two tubes together\""]
["40:24,940","40:29,500","\"I think this is the fuel tube. I really think that's a separate thing once you get the fuel\""]
["40:29,500","40:31,500","\"Don't you want the two tubes to be connected\""]
["40:31,500","40:34,340","\"Lord of the rings the two tubes\""]
["40:34,340","40:39,180","\"Okay, there's a lot of lore in that about tubes\""]
["40:40,380","40:44,460","\"Like if you read the similar little early in there's a lot of tube lore\""]
["40:44,460","40:47,520","\"Yeah, they talk about how Frodo had his tubes tied\""]
["40:47,520","40:55,420","\"He says it was his burden all hobbits have tubes and I had mine tied\""]
["40:55,420","41:05,940","\"Oh, no, it's still attached. Let me try this one more time now that that's disconnected and to bomb a deal\""]
["41:08,060","41:14,160","\"Yeah, I remember my friend fucking told me about Tom Bombadil, and I was like you're lying\""]
["41:14,160","41:20,420","\"It sounds really really weird. It's not a character like that. You can kind of see why they left it out of the movie. Yeah, absolutely\""]
["41:20,420","41:27,380","\"Wait, I think I had it there for a sec. You did and then you lost it. It actually oh\""]
["41:27,380","41:29,980","\"Yeah, it does something\""]
["41:29,980","41:34,260","\"You gotta just connect it. It's weird that it wouldn't stick that is so bizarre\""]
["41:34,260","41:41,560","\"Because of that fucking strand on the other side of it that's tugging at it. Oh, yeah, it's pulling it out. Damn it\""]
["41:41,560","41:47,980","\"Break gotta go the other side. There you go. Maybe you can shoot it in there from that\""]
["41:47,980","41:54,380","\"You think that's the idea is that I just laser it over maybe for some reason I doubt that but you could try\""]
["41:54,380","41:58,140","\"Kind of work\""]
["41:58,140","42:02,780","\"Slow, oh no, it's working it works. It did something. Holy shit\""]
["42:03,460","42:07,640","\"Don't fail me now because I'm having a good time\""]
["42:07,640","42:10,920","\"I\""]
["42:10,920","42:12,920","\"Don't want to feel it off\""]
["42:12,920","42:21,180","\"The physics of this are infuriating it looks really jank. Oh, oh my god fuck. Yeah\""]
["42:21,180","42:27,100","\"All right, please get the other one in before I fuck it screwed. I mean that one isn't even\""]
["42:27,100","42:30,260","\"Attached anything hard to have it ready\""]
["42:31,180","42:37,380","\"All right might as well while you're here the loose body physics. What are you?\""]
["42:37,380","42:39,380","\"Call you know I\""]
["42:39,380","42:45,420","\"Did not undo it. Oh, in fact, I got this one working. I think oh, yeah, you're good\""]
["42:45,420","42:50,500","\"Now now I must never come here again or touch any of those\""]
["42:50,500","42:53,260","\"fuel room\""]
["42:53,260","42:55,260","\"Prime for fuel. Oh\""]
["42:55,260","42:59,020","\"My god, there's a lot of danger here\""]
["43:00,020","43:02,020","\"I've never been in this part\""]
["43:02,020","43:05,820","\"Whoo\""]
["43:05,820","43:10,340","\"What I think I might have to build a bit of a bridge. Oh, yeah, you probably do. Oh, that's it\""]
["43:10,340","43:13,640","\"That's like a tube. You could probably just push past. There we go\""]
["43:13,640","43:16,780","\"Well done. Those to psych you out. I guess\""]
["43:16,780","43:19,980","\"Could I come right there?\""]
["43:19,980","43:26,100","\"Fuel lines are running dry right now. You'll have to get the pumps reconnected. We can do any heat treatment head over to the pipe works\""]
["43:27,660","43:31,460","\"Their animations are all amazing. I think it's a lot a lot of its procedural\""]
["43:31,460","43:38,900","\"There's definitely with like the with the way things like flail around. Yeah, it's really good\""]
["43:38,900","43:45,140","\"Haha, okay, I'm thoroughly impressed\""]
["43:45,140","43:48,740","\"Good you a whole list of fucking bullshit\""]
["43:48,740","43:51,580","\"If we do have tasks don't we?\""]
["43:52,700","43:58,580","\"Get help from the ants finds them fuel. I mean we needed to get fuel from the the dung beetles\""]
["43:58,580","44:03,340","\"He said right reconnect the propellant pipes. That's probably what you're doing now, right?\""]
["44:03,340","44:07,980","\"Oh, yeah, back to the pipe works then. I don't know what I'm doing\""]
["44:07,980","44:11,780","\"But you know that your soul is in it. You're soul\""]
["44:11,780","44:14,740","\"Tomar has the Tomar stone\""]
["44:14,740","44:22,660","\"And that will never ever change it has the soul of a previous Tomar from a different reality trapped\""]
["44:22,660","44:27,800","\"within. So we're I want to see just one previous Tomar in there do you know oh oh\""]
["44:27,800","44:31,760","\"there's more I didn't know you acquired more you obviously haven't watched enough\""]
["44:31,760","44:35,920","\"jed Lee movies yeah well if Tomar ever meets his end you can smash it and it\""]
["44:35,920","44:41,440","\"will bring back another one I want to see Tomar deep-faked on Thanos\""]
["44:41,440","44:48,760","\"that I someone could probably do that not this guy oh there's a gear there's\""]
["44:48,760","44:52,760","\"two years if you're really good you could probably just blast that in there\""]
["44:52,760","44:57,160","\"yeah really really shoot it tomorrow\""]
