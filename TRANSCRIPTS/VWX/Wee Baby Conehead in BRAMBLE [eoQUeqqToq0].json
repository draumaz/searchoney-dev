["00:39,200","00:41,200","\"Whee, oh whee!\""]
["00:41,200","00:50,200","\"I think there's a genre of gamers that really don't mind these slow burn openings, but the older you get, I find the more I cannot tolerate them.\""]
["00:50,200","00:52,200","\"I am right there with you buddy.\""]
["00:52,200","00:56,200","\"I was formally diagnosed with an attention deficit.\""]
["00:56,200","01:02,080","\"I probably got some kind of 80d or like a splash of autism or something\""]
["01:02,080","01:06,720","\"But you're also in the unique position of playing most of your games on a let's play channel\""]
["01:06,720","01:13,320","\"Where series liver died based on whether or not the first episode is fun or not? I don't even care about that\""]
["01:13,320","01:19,080","\"I just want to have fun. I definitely would consider that when I'm like suggesting stuff to play because it's like\""]
["01:19,080","01:25,240","\"It if a game doesn't get good until an hour in then it's like our first three episodes suck\""]
["01:25,360","01:26,720","\"Yeah\""]
["01:26,720","01:32,260","\"So it's gotta be like and unless the game is notably bad\""]
["01:32,260","01:34,720","\"Yeah, we can we can rip on it for three\""]
["01:34,720","01:40,500","\"Conscious of that you do realize like how many games just have boring fucking openings\""]
["01:40,500","01:44,680","\"Like there's so many because you have to teach the player the mechanics. I get why\""]
["01:44,680","01:51,840","\"But like as far as pacing goes there are a lot of games that straight up are not fun until at least half an hour in\""]
["01:51,840","01:54,160","\"Yeah, I mean this isn't the worst\""]
["01:54,760","02:00,280","\"No, this is I don't know why you're complaining about this so I'm not I'm not I feel like I started the complaining\""]

["06:08,520","06:15,480","\"And then they made a they made a spinoff about the most egregious character\""]
["06:15,480","06:21,400","\"Really? Yeah, they made one that's like tiny Tina is the narrator for the whole fucking thing\""]
["06:21,400","06:27,320","\"You know who decided that that was the fan favorite. I don't feel like any fan did\""]
["06:27,320","06:29,880","\"Yeah, I don't know\""]
["06:29,880","06:34,600","\"I feel like that was just someone's like little darling character from inside the studio\""]
["06:34,680","06:38,760","\"People swear that they like her because I've made fun of her on pregame\""]
["06:38,760","06:45,080","\"I said it was like a it was like if someone started drilling into the side of your head and then filled it with hornets\""]
