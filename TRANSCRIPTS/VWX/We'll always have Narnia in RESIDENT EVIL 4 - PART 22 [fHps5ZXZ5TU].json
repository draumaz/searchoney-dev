["02:30,260","02:35,920","\"Interesting analytics, what did I just do?\""]
["02:35,920","02:38,800","\"There's a thing over here\""]
["02:38,800","02:42,920","\"Look little gears look a little monkey. That's where Gwen Stacy died\""]

["03:44,860","03:50,660","\"We should be able to hold off our friend for at least a little while by jamming the gears in the clock tower with something.\""]
["03:50,660","03:54,960","\"I think if we jam the gears in three places, it should give us enough time to prepare for the ritual.\""]
["03:54,960","04:00,560","\"I think if we set up a puzzle of sorts, maybe he'll be stuck for a bit, but here's the solution.\""]

["04:35,600","04:42,480","\"Little spinky plank. It's down to the left. It looks like each one is accessible from\""]
["04:42,480","04:45,680","\"each floor. You probably have to go down to the\""]
["04:45,680","04:49,320","\"to the previous one. Am I losing my marbles?\""]
