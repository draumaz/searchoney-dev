["00:08,900","00:11,200","\"I'm putting this down first just to be safe.\""]
["00:11,200","00:13,200","\"Yeah, 'cause we don't know how hard this is gonna be.\""]
["00:13,200","00:18,000","\"That's the same sound clip from earlier.\""]
["00:18,000","00:19,300","\"That's a laughing drunk.\""]
["00:19,300","00:21,800","\"I couldn't read what that said.\""]
["00:21,800","00:23,400","\"I think she is healing him.\""]
["00:23,400","00:25,400","\"Yeah, you gotta kill that thing.\""]
["00:25,400","00:26,700","\"Uh, yeah, whatever.\""]

["00:27,500","00:29,000","\"What?\""]
["00:29,000","00:29,500","\"Yeah!\""]
["00:29,500","00:33,260","\"See ya.\""]
["00:33,260","00:34,260","\"Why?\""]
["00:34,260","00:36,620","\"What was the point of that?\""]
["00:36,620","00:38,020","\"I don't know what is the point of that.\""]
["00:38,020","00:40,500","\"I kind of thought she would blow up on them.\""]
["00:40,500","00:41,500","\"Yeah, what?\""]
["00:41,500","00:42,500","\"You pee?\""]
["00:42,500","00:43,500","\"Come on.\""]
["00:43,500","00:44,500","\"Come on.\""]
["00:44,500","00:47,500","\"I hate that mini game.\""]
["00:47,500","00:48,500","\"Wow.\""]

["00:49,500","00:50,500","\"Okay.\""]
["00:50,500","00:51,500","\"Yeah, anyways.\""]
["00:51,500","00:54,500","\"She died in vain.\""]
["00:54,500","00:56,500","\"What is happening?\""]
["00:56,500","00:58,500","\"You got 63 cents.\""]
["00:58,500","01:03,980","\"three cents this is very strange reality is warping Chris video games are not a\""]

["01:24,780","01:25,780","\"Go for it.\""]
["01:25,780","01:26,780","\"You're going to breeze through it.\""]
["01:26,780","01:27,780","\"We'll see.\""]
["01:27,780","01:28,780","\"Is she still dead?\""]
["01:28,780","01:29,780","\"I have no clue.\""]
["01:29,780","01:30,780","\"I did explode her.\""]
["01:30,780","01:31,780","\"I don't know.\""]
["01:31,780","01:32,780","\"I don't know.\""]
["01:32,780","01:34,780","\"It's Metal Gear.\""]
["01:34,780","01:40,780","\"It's a crazy Metal Gear.\""]
["01:40,780","01:42,780","\"Would you be pleased if your son said that?\""]
["01:42,780","01:44,780","\"He's like five years old.\""]
["01:44,780","01:46,780","\"He points at the TV and goes, \"\"Miguel Guilla.\"\"\""]
["01:46,780","01:48,780","\"Look, I didn't know you played Kojima.\""]
["01:48,780","01:49,780","\"He's in my family.\""]
["01:49,780","01:52,780","\"See, it's like the Final Fantasy 6 robot.\""]
["01:52,780","01:54,780","\"Is it maybe\""]
["01:54,780","01:58,060","\"Could be Mac warrior either it's true or like\""]
["01:58,060","02:02,840","\"Gundam or like Mega Man or like robot or like robot or like robot\""]
["02:02,840","02:08,700","\"You need to be nice. I'm being nice. Calla call it cool\""]
["02:08,700","02:15,940","\"That is all the only way to be nice. I'm curious for some reason the word won't escape my mouth right now and I don't know why\""]
["02:19,980","02:24,620","\"You can't we simply rag on shit without be called bullies\""]
["02:24,620","02:29,800","\"Oh, that was still pretty good. I do it because I love\""]
["02:29,800","02:34,060","\"It is pretty funny\""]
["02:34,060","02:37,580","\"Okay, he got a sixteenth of his life taken off\""]
["02:37,580","02:41,300","\"Nope\""]
["02:41,300","02:43,820","\"Do a little better than that you almost had it. Oh\""]
["02:43,820","02:48,500","\"My god the poor thing is gonna be a literate is\""]
["02:49,500","02:56,540","\"Negative health no look at that. We're catching up. Oh, but that one died good. I hate pig making man\""]
["02:56,540","03:01,660","\"Do you like that the life meter goes out of bounds because you did too much day actually do?\""]
["03:01,660","03:10,300","\"It's fun to see it cuz it's like oh, holy shit. Is that how level I think that's intentional. I don't think it is I wouldn't guess\""]
["03:10,300","03:15,060","\"No, I think it's because of the way that the life bars are masked\""]
["03:18,060","03:23,360","\"It's because it's scaling it based on a value and you're going so far out of bounds that it's going out scaling it\""]
["03:23,360","03:29,560","\"It's going out of the black area, but it's satisfying to see that it is. I just don't think it's intentional. Maybe I think it is\""]
["03:29,560","03:32,340","\"I think it's a nice thing to leave in anyway. Yeah\""]
["03:32,340","03:38,060","\"Do you think I like it one of the reasons that I was scared about you could developer?\""]
["03:38,060","03:44,580","\"Redoing this game was I wouldn't want it to be a George Lucas that he keeps fixing it over and over forever\""]
["03:44,660","03:51,820","\"That's true. Do you think you would do that? It's kind of feeling like if the changes weren't that significant and some of them didn't necessarily help either\""]
["03:51,820","03:57,220","\"Alex\""]
["03:57,220","04:07,180","\"I'm sorry. I put you in harm's way. However, while I am with you, nothing bad can ever happen\""]
["04:07,180","04:11,340","\"I am here to protect you. Then why were you smiling earlier with a knife killing me?\""]
["04:12,620","04:15,460","\"But I think I need you to answer some more questions\""]
["04:15,460","04:21,180","\"I mean, it probably says something when her her mind is full of evil imagery\""]
["04:21,180","04:24,140","\"Why did this Japanese guy know me?\""]
["04:24,140","04:30,680","\"Why do you attack me? What did I ever do to him? Was he Japanese? He sent a pretty American to me\""]
["04:30,680","04:37,080","\"I can only deduce an answer. Maybe an alternate reality is they they have a different accent\""]
["04:37,080","04:39,300","\"Yeah, they don't actually have Japan in that world\""]
["04:39,300","04:42,500","\"This information is the same information that you have.\""]
["04:42,500","04:46,300","\"So these are simply educated guesses based on the...\""]
["04:46,300","04:47,700","\"That can't be true.\""]
["04:47,700","04:50,100","\"That he doesn't have more information than he does.\""]
["04:50,100","04:51,100","\"Why is it even here?\""]
["04:51,100","04:53,100","\"Do you have access to a million realities?\""]
["04:53,100","04:54,100","\"Hey, fine.\""]
["04:54,100","04:56,100","\"What do you think it is?\""]
["04:56,100","04:59,100","\"Mmm, a bad guy.\""]
["04:59,100","04:59,900","\"Pssss!\""]
["04:59,900","05:05,100","\"I think it would be a safe assumption that, in a parallel life, you have harmed me.\""]
["05:05,100","05:09,100","\"That this you, Zui Majo, had some sort of relationship with you.\""]
["05:09,100","05:11,100","\"And you heard him in some way.\""]
["05:11,100","05:13,100","\"I couldn't have deduced that myself.\""]
["05:13,100","05:16,100","\"I recognized something in your soul and became angry.\""]
["05:16,100","05:18,100","\"This is why he attacked.\""]
["05:18,100","05:21,100","\"I harmed him in a parallel life?\""]
["05:21,100","05:23,100","\"Pfft! I harmed you?\""]
["05:23,100","05:25,100","\"Alex is as oblivious as ever.\""]
["05:25,100","05:29,100","\"We are not responsible for the actions of our parallel selves.\""]
["05:29,100","05:34,100","\"But that does not mean we can't feel sorry for the crimes committed against other trolls.\""]
["05:34,100","05:37,100","\"There are times where someone expresses how they have been harmed.\""]
["05:37,100","05:43,100","\"And as humans, our media reaction is to become defensive, and our defense, so that we do not harm others.\""]
["05:43,100","05:44,100","\"We don't harm others!\""]
["05:44,100","05:46,100","\"Oh, excuse me, you're a robot? Pfft!\""]
["05:46,100","05:48,100","\"Could you stop more explaining me?\""]
["05:48,100","05:49,100","\"Pfft!\""]
["05:49,100","05:53,100","\"Where we decide what type of human we will be, which is worse, to harm someone in the past.\""]
["05:53,100","05:57,100","\"And continue to harm them by justifying your past actions.\""]
["05:57,100","06:01,100","\"Or harming someone in the past, and accepting that your choices hurt them.\""]
["06:01,100","06:03,100","\"Uh...\""]
["06:03,100","06:06,020","\"Too many choices too long of sentence.\""]
["06:06,020","06:08,300","\"Can you please repeat the more concise?\""]
["06:08,300","06:09,140","\"- Yes.\""]
["06:09,140","06:10,060","\"(laughs)\""]
["06:10,060","06:12,660","\"- Yes, you might feel harmed in the process\""]
["06:12,660","06:14,300","\"by admitting your mistakes,\""]
["06:14,300","06:15,900","\"but this is a good type of pain.\""]
["06:15,900","06:17,140","\"- Chris, do you?\""]
["06:17,140","06:18,780","\"Does this feel too heady to you?\""]
["06:18,780","06:20,780","\"Because I'm like, yeah, this is fucking basic.\""]
["06:20,780","06:21,620","\"- Yes.\""]
["06:21,620","06:24,580","\"- Logical shit that I process on a day-to-day basis.\""]
["06:24,580","06:25,420","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:25,420","06:28,580","\"- I mean, I really don't understand what the point is.\""]
["06:28,580","06:29,980","\"- Did I really do that?\""]
["06:31,120","06:32,760","\"Did I just have a boss battle?\""]
["06:32,760","06:35,560","\"Did I always deny harm someone?\""]
["06:35,560","06:36,040","\"What?\""]
["06:36,040","06:40,320","\"This is the first time he just ever wondered if he ever did anything.\""]
["06:40,320","06:42,320","\"Maybe.\""]
["06:42,320","06:44,280","\"Yes.\""]
["06:44,280","06:47,200","\"I totally did.\""]
["06:47,200","06:48,240","\"Oh my God.\""]
["06:48,240","06:50,280","\"He's not thinking of Rory right now.\""]
["06:50,280","06:53,760","\"We must always work to be better.\""]
["06:53,760","06:56,560","\"The better person is known the person.\""]
["06:56,560","06:58,880","\"Her left arm is like tucked under her breasts.\""]
["06:58,880","06:59,720","\"Oh, yes.\""]
["07:00,360","07:01,360","\"You're right.\""]
["07:01,360","07:03,360","\"Oh, how?\""]
["07:03,360","07:05,360","\"What a bizarre mistake.\""]
["07:05,360","07:06,360","\"That's weird.\""]
["07:06,360","07:10,360","\"There are moments when I understand intellectually how I must act.\""]
["07:10,360","07:15,360","\"But then something happens somewhere in the recesses of my mind.\""]
["07:15,360","07:18,360","\"I don't know if I believe that.\""]
["07:18,360","07:19,360","\"The...\""]
["07:19,360","07:26,360","\"You're a robot that's like processing millions and millions of alternate realities.\""]
["07:26,360","07:30,360","\"You've clearly done this operation, probably countless times.\""]
["07:30,360","07:35,360","\"You'd think that it would become, like, routine to the point where you're not making mistakes anymore.\""]
["07:35,360","07:36,360","\"However, the overwhelm-\""]
["07:36,360","07:42,360","\"You would think about, like, the eventuality of how a human mind would degrade over that much time.\""]
["07:42,360","07:46,360","\"By the way, the thing about being defensive, the sure is sounding like it.\""]
["07:46,360","07:47,360","\"Fair enough.\""]
["07:47,360","07:53,360","\"This version of me chooses the kind path. I cannot allow any harm to come to you. Without you.\""]
["07:53,360","07:57,280","\"Hmm. I wouldn't know what to do anymore. So just remember\""]
["07:57,280","08:00,160","\"It's not important Alex\""]
["08:00,160","08:06,760","\"To worry about what we accomplish. He's not gonna cut my head off again. Is she? I don't like that\""]
["08:06,760","08:09,600","\"Hurt\""]
["08:09,600","08:14,440","\"There exist perfect versions of us who didn't fail or harm others. I don't care\""]
["08:14,440","08:18,160","\"I don't care about my parlour a little fucking universe self who cares\""]
["08:18,160","08:21,840","\"Of yourself\""]
["08:21,840","08:26,120","\"So should I feel guilty that I know you dumbass\""]
["08:26,120","08:34,320","\"Just acknowledge that the part of you that harm him exists in all humans. Thank you lady\""]
["08:34,320","08:42,480","\"Wait, I have one more question will you kiss me? That's what I was about to say\""]
["08:42,480","08:51,440","\"Did I harm any of the other women we met the ones who are also you Oda Nyla\""]
["08:51,440","08:54,440","\"- Silla, Serna, Bella.\""]
["08:54,440","08:56,080","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:56,080","08:58,320","\"- When I'm staring at me with that expressionless face\""]
["08:58,320","09:00,680","\"of hers, a face of plastic.\""]
["09:00,680","09:02,160","\"- Lasted for hours.\""]
["09:02,160","09:04,120","\"- Looking at her, I thought of a satellite floating\""]
["09:04,120","09:06,840","\"in space, a drifting piece of metal.\""]
["09:06,840","09:08,840","\"- It's been a while since we've had one of these monologues,\""]
["09:08,840","09:09,920","\"so I guess we should enjoy it.\""]
["09:09,920","09:11,880","\"- Why would you start thinking of a satellite\""]
["09:11,880","09:13,680","\"while you're talking to her?\""]
["09:13,680","09:15,480","\"- I thought of Sputnik.\""]
["09:15,480","09:18,120","\"I don't know why, but maybe there's some collision.\""]
["09:18,120","09:20,160","\"- Probably because the name sounds funny to me.\""]
["09:20,160","09:21,960","\"In fact, you can't hear anything in space.\""]
["09:21,960","09:22,800","\"I chuckled.\""]
["09:22,800","09:23,920","\"She did not look happy.\""]
["09:23,920","09:26,080","\"I thought of the Horsehead Nebula and Pluto.\""]
["09:26,080","09:28,040","\"It was really cool.\""]
["09:28,040","09:31,920","\"One of those planets crashed into the earth.\""]
["09:31,920","09:34,440","\"I wondered, well, I wonder what I'd die if that happened.\""]
["09:34,440","09:35,760","\"Maybe.\""]
["09:35,760","09:38,320","\"Maybe in an alternate reality.\""]
["09:38,320","09:41,160","\"This boogie imagery made me think about death.\""]
["09:41,160","09:43,200","\"Seemed to have jammed into something in there.\""]
["09:43,200","09:48,200","\"Despite the fact that everything here is really, you know, contradictory.\""]
["09:48,200","09:49,520","\"I trusted her anyways.\""]
["09:49,520","09:51,520","\"I love that I could read the robot's face.\""]
["09:51,520","09:53,760","\"Shut up so you couldn't...\""]
["09:53,760","09:56,760","\"I proceeded from the room.\""]
["09:56,760","09:57,760","\"*laughs*\""]
["09:57,760","10:00,640","\"It's very interesting to me that you ask this.\""]
["10:00,640","10:03,560","\"I'm going to choose to not answer questions.\""]
["10:03,560","10:05,560","\"Mmm, that's a great sign.\""]
["10:05,560","10:06,560","\"*laughs*\""]
["10:06,560","10:10,560","\"There was one last location I'd like to show you, and it's quite a distress.\""]
["10:10,560","10:11,560","\"Oh my god.\""]
["10:11,560","10:14,040","\"There will be many switches and platforms.\""]
["10:14,040","10:16,320","\"You will endure them.\""]
["10:16,320","10:18,320","\"This is really pissing me out.\""]
["10:18,320","10:21,320","\"Along to wash away the bitter taste in my mouth.\""]
["10:21,320","10:24,320","\"But even sitting in my bottle wouldn't cleanse me of it.\""]
["10:24,320","10:27,320","\"The whole situation felt like a dream.\""]
["10:27,320","10:29,320","\"It was a lot to take care of.\""]
["10:29,320","10:31,320","\"What is she talking about?\""]
["10:31,320","10:34,320","\"As if I was naked in Jell-O right now.\""]
["10:34,320","10:36,320","\"As if I was making metaphor after metaphor.\""]
["10:36,320","10:40,320","\"I asked her, \"\"Is there an alternate reality where I could get naked in Jell-O?\"\"\""]
["10:40,320","10:42,320","\"She had no response.\""]
["10:42,320","10:44,320","\"Even that I was calling myself,\""]
["10:44,320","10:46,440","\"Things around me weren't that weird.\""]
