["05:02,520","05:07,740","\"No, but you know what some of we are wrong because we're not supposed to play a fucking switch game with a GameCube controller\""]
["05:07,740","05:09,920","\"controllers over 20 years old and\""]
["05:09,920","05:13,920","\"But we had just been playing Smash Brothers at the time.\""]
["05:13,920","05:15,920","\"But they didn't assign the game with the GameCube controller in mind.\""]

["05:16,920","05:18,920","\"And the sun in our eyes.\""]
["05:18,920","05:21,920","\"And I have a deformity in my fingers though.\""]
