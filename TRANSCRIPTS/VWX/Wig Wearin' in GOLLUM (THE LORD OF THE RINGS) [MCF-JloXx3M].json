["13:34,600","13:40,020","\"Okay, I get it now so you do this and then you jump, okay, okay?\""]
["13:40,020","13:47,500","\"It was my fault. It was my phone what I was saying all to get a bad wing the game was the line the witch in the war\""]

["14:38,040","14:44,920","\"When they with GameCube as are the directors cut yeah, that's sucked and I was like this is the same game as the dream cast\""]
["14:44,920","14:49,880","\"Oh Sonic DX. Yeah, Sonic Adventure DX dude. Did you know that if you would have done mission mode?\""]
["14:49,880","14:51,880","\"You would have unlocked a bunch of like game gear games\""]

["15:05,780","15:07,780","\"They didn't have any of the games of the mission mode\""]
["15:07,780","15:11,660","\"But in the mission mode of the game cube you can unlock a bunch of game gear games if you did the mission\""]
["15:11,660","15:15,300","\"Which I didn't know when I started doing the missions are starting unlocking all these game gear games\""]
["15:15,300","15:22,180","\"But you didn't get for the PC which is fucking stupid so but I mean I can understand I'm just a devotee to sonic\""]
["15:22,180","15:27,240","\"But yeah, I can understand the dreamcast one when I played it and I had the little\""]
["15:27,240","15:29,180","\"That memory card you have the little\""]
["15:29,180","15:31,180","\"The VMU. Oh, yeah\""]

["15:51,580","15:59,340","\"And then when you go back to the game you plug it back in doesn't it yeah\""]
["15:59,340","16:05,220","\"It even though none of that affects the actual core gameplay that was a genius care\""]
["16:05,220","16:08,900","\"It's like kind of piggybacking off like Tamagotchi. Yeah, yeah\""]
["16:08,900","16:15,400","\"That's pretty much exactly what it was is Tamagotchi had only come out like a few years prior the Game Boy Advance peripheral\""]

["16:38,360","16:41,320","\"Unless you did golem theft auto\""]
["16:41,320","16:44,920","\"It's not really an easy\""]
