["00:22,480","00:28,960","\"counting rain took up like four hours. [laughter]\""]
["00:28,960","00:31,040","\"He needs to make himself like more.\""]

["00:36,880","00:39,400","\"You quit out of the whole game.\""]
["00:39,400","00:44,560","\"It's like he tries to count the rain, but he can't.\""]
["00:44,560","00:47,000","\"So he needs to kind of like up his.\""]

["00:48,160","00:50,680","\"Ah, ah, ah, it's just slapping his head.\""]

["01:13,480","01:16,240","\"- I learned that there was a guy whose name\""]
["01:16,240","01:18,640","\"was Kenneth Lamar-noid.\""]
["01:18,640","01:21,160","\"- Well yeah, everybody wanted to tell us about this\""]
["01:21,160","01:22,320","\"in all the comments.\""]
["01:22,320","01:27,320","\"- He thought that the annoyed character was like,\""]
["01:27,240","01:30,400","\"The Domino's corporation mocking him.\""]
["01:30,400","01:32,420","\"He had like, Skits of Freddy Air or something.\""]
["01:32,420","01:33,260","\"- Really?\""]
["01:33,260","01:35,880","\"- So he like, broke into a, well not broken to a Domino's.\""]
["01:35,880","01:37,480","\"I guess just walked into a Domino's thing.\""]
["01:37,480","01:39,400","\"- Into a Domino's as one does.\""]
["01:39,400","01:44,400","\"- And just like, took hostages and demanded to speak\""]
["01:44,400","01:47,040","\"with the CEO of Domino's and shit like that.\""]
["01:47,040","01:49,040","\"- That's why they canceled the Noid?\""]
["01:49,040","01:51,360","\"- No, they kept doing it for a couple of years after that,\""]
["01:51,360","01:52,600","\"and then people just hated him.\""]
["01:52,600","01:54,920","\"I think they just canceled him 'cause they hated him.\""]
["01:54,920","01:56,960","\"- People just like to say that's why they canceled him\""]
["01:56,960","02:02,900","\"Because it's a way more dramatic and interesting story involving the annoyed than any annoyed related fact\""]
["02:02,900","02:08,200","\"But but the annoyed survived his namesake. I need to make it a disclaimer\""]
["02:08,200","02:13,840","\"This is the episode where I learned how to not be really really shit at this game\""]
["02:13,840","02:21,040","\"I studied the one making and I learned that I'm stupid. Well now we're gonna hold you to a far higher standard\""]

["02:38,640","02:45,680","\"Cannot have one without the other so it is absolutely nothing to do with stature\""]
["02:45,680","02:49,320","\"It's everything to do with with disabilities related to crippling back pain\""]
["02:50,040","02:56,960","\"I love it. Ah stop hurting medium noise. Oh, I got this one everyone yelled at me because I didn't use this enough\""]

["03:41,120","03:43,760","\"This guy's bad at this game. I'll help out a bit\""]
["03:43,760","03:48,200","\"Well that guy's that guy's not nice. I don't like fucking with those guys\""]
["03:48,200","03:51,620","\"What is what are those guys if you have water on you right?\""]
["03:51,620","03:57,720","\"Snow if you look out dude and pajamas carrying a candle. What is he? It looks like Finn from adventure time\""]

["04:24,480","04:29,380","\"It's not that it's not as good as you think it's really risky because if you're standing next to an explosive\""]
["04:29,380","04:32,220","\"You like silly look at it and blow it up already of those like\""]
["04:32,220","04:35,840","\"Better because I really want to see the noise with laser eyes, but\""]
["04:35,840","04:43,080","\"Is that a v-stream v-stream after you coom and you're oh and you you got it\""]
["04:43,080","04:49,520","\"You got a little something blocking the pathway and things take a little v split. Yeah\""]
["04:49,520","04:57,360","\"That is like one of the worst feelings in the world where you like go to pee afterwards and it fucking like just goes on either side of the toilet\""]
["04:57,360","05:06,240","\"Personally like that you do. Yeah, I think it does give it gives your your toilet like an interesting vibe when you walk in and see that\""]
["05:06,240","05:11,920","\"It's an adventure when you do it. I really like that fourth. They're just the style of that one. You're\""]
["05:12,360","05:19,560","\"It's it's it's like a big mighty trident thing. Oh, yeah, I don't know. It does look cool\""]
["05:19,560","05:22,760","\"I just think it looks cool that that big red wand\""]
["05:22,760","05:25,760","\"shoots a big angry load\""]
["05:25,760","05:28,800","\"Destruction look at that water trail\""]
["05:28,800","05:31,760","\"We don't have to worry. You know more look at that\""]
["05:31,760","05:38,920","\"That is so neat. Yeah, you could just dilute anything. No that hurt guys or does it just make big water?\""]
["05:39,160","05:45,560","\"Yeah, it hurts guys, but it's not that great honestly makes big water big water just makes me think of lamb before time\""]
["05:45,560","05:48,760","\"But these guys do is that what they were looking for big water?\""]
["05:48,760","05:54,120","\"One of the crappy sequels they sing a song called big big big big water\""]
["05:54,120","05:59,520","\"For real yeah, that's what they call the ocean. They call it big water\""]
["05:59,520","06:07,200","\"This this this level has a lot of things that died of water like that nice. Yeah, you're now the noi down\""]
["06:07,200","06:12,040","\"I know I watched the shit out of those movies as a kid because I like dinosaurs\""]
["06:12,040","06:15,800","\"But I cannot remember for the life of me like anything about them\""]
["06:15,800","06:22,200","\"I don't think anything's worth remembering we even re-watched the first one recently and it's like it's the best animated\""]
["06:22,200","06:30,200","\"But it's it's not it's objectively just like a nothing movie, but it's got a huge drawings and music\""]
["06:30,200","06:33,800","\"I mean, that's the appeal. It's sort of just like a tone for a movie\""]
["06:34,560","06:41,000","\"Like it's about dinosaurs and you get to see dinosaurs and that's about it. Fuck you stupid thing. Yeah get wet. Oh\""]
["06:41,000","06:43,600","\"So spells is that shoot out?\""]
["06:43,600","06:45,600","\"Not okay, that's pretty good actually\""]
["06:45,600","06:49,760","\"We need to get some kind of water spells that are more powerful\""]
["06:49,760","06:53,300","\"Fuck you what about that little galga guy?\""]
["06:53,300","07:00,480","\"Kind of one is that for now that was Chris the water made that's so oh no don't nose man stop\""]
["07:00,480","07:02,400","\"whoa\""]
["07:02,400","07:04,400","\"was this\""]
["07:04,400","07:07,640","\"Always cast fire trail has homing and dynamite.\""]
["07:07,640","07:08,640","\"Mmm.\""]
["07:08,640","07:10,680","\"I don't know.\""]
["07:10,680","07:12,120","\"But do you?\""]
["07:12,120","07:18,320","\"So here's what I've learned is that the chainsaw spell makes shit like really fast.\""]
["07:18,320","07:21,600","\"And the luminous drill does that too if you put it in front of things.\""]
["07:21,600","07:24,560","\"But the wand has to be no shuffle.\""]
["07:24,560","07:26,800","\"And, yeah.\""]
["07:26,800","07:29,400","\"So if we find chainsaw luminous drill will be better off.\""]
["07:29,400","07:32,400","\"But if we don't, nobody will like it snowball.\""]
["07:32,400","07:34,400","\"I think they'll like you\""]
["07:34,400","07:37,520","\"I don't know\""]
["07:37,520","07:43,840","\"Also, you know, what's shitty, but this one is if we if there's electronic or not like trying if there's electricity and we're in water. We die\""]
["07:43,840","07:49,120","\"Mmm, so be real careful. Yeah, that's not a thunder bug is it no, we're five\""]
["07:49,120","07:52,480","\"Girl\""]
["07:52,480","07:54,480","\"Around that bug\""]
["07:54,480","07:59,080","\"That'd be like a good YouTube show around the bug\""]
["08:00,800","08:06,720","\"They just they find a bug and drown it and see how long it takes I showed Tomar video of a\""]
["08:06,720","08:09,280","\"cockroach getting\""]
["08:09,280","08:13,440","\"For like yeah for like a solid minute\""]
["08:13,440","08:19,240","\"It was kind of the guys kind of relentless it didn't live through most of that minute or did it diet media\""]
["08:19,240","08:23,560","\"I don't know it did retain the shape of its body a lot longer than I would have expected\""]
["08:23,560","08:26,960","\"Isn't that crazy you think it would have liked turned to ash, but it just it turned black\""]
["08:27,360","08:34,160","\"They've they always say cockroaches would survive a nuclear bomb, but I don't know how or why they think that\""]
["08:34,160","08:40,640","\"It's because isn't it because they live in the ground. Yeah, I don't know if they'd survive they'd survive like radiation exposure\""]
["08:40,640","08:44,400","\"I don't know if they'd survive being in the blast radius of a nuclear bomb\""]
["08:44,400","08:48,680","\"So they found out that roaches are radiation proof is that something like that?\""]
["08:48,680","08:54,800","\"I think so. I think they at least are highly resistant compared to most other things with DNA\""]
["08:55,320","09:02,840","\"I don't know sometimes I just take inventory of like the little factoids that I know and and just wonder like if they make sense or not\""]
["09:02,840","09:04,540","\"That that is a good thing to do\""]
["09:04,540","09:09,000","\"We all hear one stupid thing once and we just like believe it forever\""]
["09:09,000","09:16,280","\"Confirming it like pit bulls have locking jaws or something and it's like that's just not true. They're fucking scary though\""]
["09:16,280","09:18,380","\"They're buff they do have really strong jaws\""]
["09:18,380","09:21,100","\"They're funny dogs out there\""]
["09:21,240","09:25,760","\"Every pimple I've met has been really fucking nice till you step on its tail and it kills you\""]
["09:25,760","09:29,900","\"Well, then don't step on its tail. It's the real lesson here\""]
["09:29,900","09:33,940","\"Okay, this one is very slow and this guy's gonna kill me I\""]
["09:33,940","09:38,720","\"Fucking learned a really really upsetting fact the other day. What was it?\""]
["09:38,720","09:43,280","\"Nobody knows how eels reproduce what did it not have a penis? No\""]
["09:43,280","09:49,240","\"Sexual organs at all well my theory is now here's what happens right?\""]
["09:49,760","09:54,180","\"Eels when they get old and they're about to die eels yes\""]
["09:54,180","10:01,600","\"Again seriously vanish. No, they go to the fucking Bermuda triangle and then more eels come out\""]
["10:01,600","10:08,680","\"But nobody knows where the fucking eels come from and they never observed the fucking it's true\""]
["10:08,680","10:14,260","\"And this is all eels is a specific type of you see that's the other thing is there's not as many different\""]
["10:14,400","10:20,600","\"Species of eels as we thought there were there was there's a bunch of eels that are like different\""]
["10:20,600","10:24,240","\"Points of the lifecycle of like the same eel wait\""]
["10:24,240","10:27,920","\"Wait, you're saying like an electric eel is the same as like a more a eel?\""]
["10:27,920","10:32,840","\"I don't know if I'm necessarily saying that but I'm definitely saying that they're more condensed than we think\""]
["10:32,840","10:36,400","\"They are did you say that did you start this with seals or eels eels?\""]
["10:36,400","10:42,440","\"You were implying that eels had something to do with seals reproducing. Oh, no, no\""]
["10:42,440","10:45,980","\"I thought you were going to apply that eels were the penises of seals or something\""]
["10:45,980","10:52,100","\"No, I have never seen a penis on a seal before I think those just retract\""]
["10:52,100","10:56,180","\"My guess for that. I don't think that's as great of a mystery\""]
["10:56,180","11:02,380","\"I feel like I've been in like at like an Eastern medicine store to actually saw a seal penis like in a bag once\""]
["11:02,380","11:04,720","\"Yeah, so myth busted on that one\""]
["11:04,720","11:11,140","\"But yeah, no, I just I just learned that fact like two days ago and fucking I\""]
["11:11,480","11:15,180","\"At this point, I would kill a man to know the answer.\""]
["11:15,180","11:17,220","\"Like I just, I'd need to know.\""]
["11:17,220","11:19,500","\"- That's legitimately interesting.\""]
["11:19,500","11:20,620","\"The idea that--\""]
["11:20,620","11:21,540","\"- Eels or penises?\""]
["11:21,540","11:24,660","\"- So my theory is that all eels in the universe\""]
["11:24,660","11:28,260","\"have always existed since the beginning of time\""]
["11:28,260","11:30,700","\"and there's a fixed amount of eels\""]
["11:30,700","11:33,860","\"and they all are stored on the other side\""]
["11:33,860","11:37,820","\"of an interdimensional portal in the Bermuda Triangle.\""]
["11:37,820","11:39,420","\"- I had a pet of eel, I'll ever tell you that.\""]
["11:39,420","11:40,260","\"- Did you?\""]
["11:40,260","11:41,860","\"What did it do?\""]
["11:41,860","11:42,660","\"Nothing.\""]
["11:42,660","11:45,180","\"It was coiled up in a jar very cruelly.\""]
["11:45,180","11:46,300","\"Oh, I didn't do it.\""]
["11:46,300","11:46,820","\"It wasn't me.\""]
["11:46,820","11:47,540","\"It was my own call.\""]
["11:47,540","11:48,860","\"He didn't know any better.\""]
["11:48,860","11:50,420","\"He just brought you a jar.\""]
["11:50,420","11:51,900","\"A jar of eel.\""]
["11:51,900","11:52,340","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:52,340","11:53,660","\"And I was like, what do I do with it?\""]
["11:53,660","11:54,420","\"He's like, just keep it.\""]
["11:54,420","11:55,620","\"It's your pet.\""]
["11:55,620","11:55,980","\"And I didn't.\""]
["11:55,980","12:00,140","\"I released it into a place called the Slob.\""]
["12:00,140","12:02,860","\"Well, it's in a better place now.\""]
["12:02,860","12:05,380","\"And by that, I mean, it's in the fucking Bermuda triangle.\""]
["12:05,380","12:06,340","\"It's in the Slob.\""]
["12:06,340","12:07,780","\"It's in the Slob.\""]
["12:07,780","12:08,780","\"What is the Slob?\""]
["12:08,780","12:10,180","\"Is that like a swamp?\""]
["12:10,180","12:12,460","\"No, it's just like, I don't know why they call it the Slob.\""]
["12:12,460","12:15,140","\"It's just a place in Waxford where you go for walks with your doggy.\""]
["12:15,140","12:18,380","\"Is it a body of water?\""]
["12:18,380","12:20,300","\"It's next to the beach kinda.\""]
["12:20,300","12:21,500","\"Oh, okay.\""]
["12:21,500","12:23,140","\"And there's this pig slaughterhouse.\""]
["12:23,140","12:25,180","\"So every time you walk down it, there's a bunch of pigs screaming.\""]
["12:25,180","12:26,020","\"Ugh.\""]
["12:26,020","12:27,020","\"That's fucking scary.\""]
["12:27,020","12:28,820","\"Maybe that's where they call it the Slob.\""]
["12:28,820","12:30,260","\"That makes sense.\""]
