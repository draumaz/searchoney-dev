["00:07,000","00:10,000","\"This is Witch Hunt. It is a new scary game.\""]
["00:10,000","00:12,000","\"Are you freaking ready, Zach?\""]
["00:12,000","00:13,000","\"Oh, I'm pretty ready.\""]
["00:13,000","00:17,000","\"This is a game that I have played for maybe four minutes.\""]
["00:17,000","00:18,000","\"And I liked what I saw.\""]
["00:18,000","00:20,000","\"Well, I see what we've got.\""]
["00:20,000","00:22,000","\"Not what we've got by new game.\""]
["00:22,000","00:23,000","\"Yes.\""]
["00:23,000","00:24,000","\"[Inaudible]\""]
["00:24,000","00:25,000","\"Read it.\""]
["00:25,000","00:28,000","\"With debobed, slaughtered by family.\""]
["00:28,000","00:31,000","\"I decided to devote my life to a fake evil.\""]
["00:31,000","00:37,000","\"At first I was motivated by a villainous, but then I made a bad noise, and I made a bad noise.\""]
["00:37,000","00:43,000","\"Recently I heard in a small town called Belleville, people started to disappear and get killed by some creature.\""]
["00:43,000","00:44,000","\"Uh oh.\""]
["00:44,000","00:45,000","\"That's not good.\""]
["00:45,000","00:48,000","\"I immediately went to that town.\""]
["00:48,000","00:49,000","\"Bad idea.\""]
["00:49,000","00:51,000","\"Uh, that's a bad idea, but you know what?\""]
["00:51,000","00:54,000","\"It makes for an interesting concept, so we'll keep going.\""]
["00:54,000","00:59,500","\"Something big attacked me on my way to Belleville. I was able to scare it off\""]
["00:59,500","01:06,360","\"But my horse ran away with most of my supplies luckily. I was able to get to town on foot shit\""]
["01:06,360","01:09,320","\"Yeah, man, this is me\""]
["01:09,320","01:16,280","\"This is me. So the story is he's on his way to kiss a creature to a town. Yeah, so he's he's heard word. There's a spooky creature\""]
["01:16,280","01:22,040","\"So this guy lets you trade shit\""]
["01:22,720","01:24,720","\"Right now we've got 50 coins\""]
["01:24,720","01:32,620","\"And let's see what do you let's see we got here free what do we can get for free there the thunder totem\""]
["01:32,620","01:37,640","\"That's pretty cool. Yeah, what's up freeze good. Okay, so yeah in this game you're hunting down the thing\""]
["01:37,640","01:42,660","\"You're kind of like a van hell sing ish kind of a guy. I see so you might be your creature hunter\""]
["01:42,660","01:49,020","\"Yeah, you're your your girl creature hunter. Yes. I like these little icons are interesting. I'll know I'll no longer receive fault\""]
["01:49,020","01:53,320","\"I'll get that one - oh, we fuck okay, so that was a bonk now\""]
["01:53,320","01:59,720","\"Do you know how to get coins? Yeah, okay, so what we got to do is we got to go out in the world and hunt for treasure\""]
["01:59,720","02:05,000","\"Check this out. Oh my god. You ran so fast. Can you kill that thing?\""]
["02:05,000","02:06,320","\"That thing?\""]
["02:06,320","02:13,640","\"Can you kill that monster? The fucking beast the creature? No, you just have to open your inventory. This is my inventory\""]
["02:13,640","02:17,480","\"These are my skills. They stay on me once I have them forever, which is kind of cool\""]
["02:17,480","02:22,900","\"So you can't lose them mm-hmm. They don't fall off you like sonic rings. You get hit where you prayed at church\""]
["02:22,900","02:29,040","\"That's uncle church. You're probably looking for a lot of luck week. You're probably looking\""]
["02:29,040","02:31,620","\"Fortunately he got killed by that horrible beast\""]
["02:31,620","02:36,540","\"Okay, this guy's head is too big for his fucking body provide medical help if you need it\""]
["02:36,540","02:40,320","\"Yeah, give me that I've only got 85 health\""]
["02:40,320","02:46,420","\"So you're yours. Are you injured, right? Yeah now? I'm a hundred. I'm good. I'm good, baby\""]
["02:46,800","02:52,080","\"So anyway, this town needs our help. That's the whole plot. We need to go find the beast\""]
["02:52,080","02:57,520","\"Now so it's sort of open world for lack of a better turn with the sense of there's no real\""]
["02:57,520","02:59,440","\"Does it mean does it tell you a way to go?\""]
["02:59,440","03:04,840","\"Do you just kind of explore yourself and figure out what you well first? We're gonna go here. This is the where the mayor leave\""]
["03:04,840","03:08,040","\"Things are\""]
["03:08,040","03:15,360","\"As the mayor of Belleville I can guarantee that if you'll really be able to help our town\""]
["03:15,640","03:20,360","\"Your doings will be greatly rewarded and you'll have our eternal gratitude\""]
["03:20,360","03:25,440","\"To get to the woods go across the bridge there careful\""]
["03:25,440","03:28,760","\"People have seen some undead creatures in those woods\""]
["03:28,760","03:33,560","\"So we are dealing with something much more sinister than just a wild beast\""]
["03:33,560","03:36,880","\"Good luck and God bless you\""]
["03:36,880","03:42,620","\"Okay, so that's what I like about this game. Uh, there's not too much places to go, but if you\""]
["03:43,720","03:52,240","\"nudges you with oh my god are you scared I thought I saw somebody walk past the\""]
["03:52,240","03:56,940","\"door no genuinely genuinely genuinely\""]
["03:56,940","03:59,560","\"this game I'm not even that's my cat I'm not even\""]
["03:59,560","04:02,880","\"it's what's feet I thought it was Nile for a second my\""]
["04:02,880","04:07,920","\"capacity or I swear that scared me you right now you've actually scared me so\""]
["04:07,920","04:12,080","\"now we're we're probably playing this game with a man in the house a fucking\""]
["04:12,080","04:18,460","\"Stocking the halls. Yeah, so anyway that that's that's as much as the intro you're gonna get it gets you it puts you right in\""]
["04:18,460","04:23,700","\"So he ledges you he says go across the bridge, right? Yeah, and now I'm gonna hand the game over to you\""]
["04:23,700","04:27,620","\"Okay, and I want you to play and have fun push E to go to the woods. Oh\""]
["04:27,620","04:34,920","\"When a powerful monster is nearby my heart starts beating and consumes mana\""]
["04:34,920","04:41,200","\"The closer I am to the monster the faster my heart beats so it's best to start running to identify the direction of the monster\""]
["04:41,840","04:46,100","\"People say that I possess this ability because the blood of an angel runs through my veins\""]
["04:46,100","04:49,420","\"So basically it works like Slenderman, right?\""]
["04:49,420","04:55,020","\"Where it's like it the closer he gets you you get static it's the same kind of thing\""]
["04:55,020","05:00,820","\"Actually, I'm not sure I so you haven't even gotten this far. Have you I've never actually come across the beast\""]
["05:00,820","05:04,380","\"That's your fucking horse\""]
["05:04,380","05:11,420","\"Kazoo can I I can't I can't I can't I can't expect oh no Bella. I really hoped you'd manage to run away\""]
["05:11,420","05:12,420","\"Oh no.\""]
["05:12,420","05:14,360","\"Pick that shit up.\""]
["05:14,360","05:15,960","\"What is that?\""]
["05:15,960","05:16,960","\"Silver bullets.\""]
["05:16,960","05:18,960","\"And how do I fucking shoot my gun?\""]
["05:18,960","05:21,800","\"Okay so um you're gonna run into little monsters I think.\""]
["05:21,800","05:23,420","\"Oh there's a guy over there.\""]
["05:23,420","05:25,360","\"There's a little man over there.\""]
["05:25,360","05:27,240","\"Switching weapons is fast and reloading.\""]
["05:27,240","05:30,980","\"So right if you take a shot and you miss uh it's gonna take you a long time to reload\""]
["05:30,980","05:32,960","\"it and you right click the aim.\""]
["05:32,960","05:35,560","\"Okay so when this guy- My vision is so bad I'm gonna try to-\""]
["05:35,560","05:38,160","\"No it's not he's small on the screen.\""]
["05:38,160","05:39,560","\"I should charge him.\""]
["05:39,560","05:41,560","\"Don't do it, Zach, don't do it.\""]
["05:41,560","05:43,560","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:43,560","05:44,560","\"Don't do it.\""]
["05:44,560","05:46,560","\"(gunshot)\""]
["05:46,560","05:47,560","\"You got him.\""]
["05:47,560","05:48,560","\"Did I get him?\""]
["05:48,560","05:49,560","\"You got that guy.\""]
["05:49,560","05:50,560","\"And then you walk over him.\""]
["05:50,560","05:52,560","\"And that blue stuff is mana.\""]
["05:52,560","05:54,560","\"Did I just, can I get any of these numbers?\""]
["05:54,560","05:55,560","\"Is that just that?\""]
["05:55,560","05:56,560","\"I got it from him?\""]
["05:56,560","05:57,560","\"I think you got it.\""]
["05:57,560","05:58,560","\"Yeah, you just gotta make sure you can pull.\""]
["05:58,560","05:59,560","\"Whoa, what the fuck was that?\""]
["05:59,560","06:01,560","\"That was so much fucking brain.\""]
["06:01,560","06:03,560","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:03,560","06:04,560","\"What was this?\""]
["06:04,560","06:06,560","\"We're playing this with headphones turned up full blast.\""]
["06:06,560","06:07,560","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["06:07,560","06:08,560","\"Super spooky effects.\""]
["06:08,560","06:10,960","\"Okay, okay, Zach. Um, what we do I go?\""]
["06:10,960","06:14,360","\"This is the thing. It's a literal fork. It's a fork in the road.\""]
["06:14,360","06:18,560","\"The cool thing about this game is what you're hunting. It's on a big world map, right?\""]
["06:18,560","06:22,760","\"So it's just wandering. So you might just run into it no matter where you go. So you just walk around.\""]
["06:22,760","06:25,760","\"Now, can I see the map at all? Is it like a map button?\""]
["06:25,760","06:27,760","\"I don't think you have a map yet. Push M.\""]
["06:27,760","06:33,560","\"Oh, I thought I thought. Okay, never mind.\""]
["06:33,560","06:35,560","\"Oh!\""]
["06:35,560","06:36,560","\"What?\""]
["06:37,560","06:39,560","\"Oh\""]
["06:39,560","06:45,140","\"Lord I don't like this. Oh, get the fuck out. I might be right toys right now. I don't know. It's possible\""]
["06:45,140","06:48,020","\"That's not like a tree bridge right?\""]
["06:48,020","06:51,820","\"You thought you heard a tree break and that's what I thought I heard\""]
["06:51,820","06:55,500","\"What do you think of the atmosphere?\""]
["06:55,500","07:02,580","\"Like how it's not even like dark dark, but it's like dark enough. It's gloomy. It's gloomy. It's a little it's twilight\""]
["07:02,580","07:07,940","\"I love gloomy shit. I love also. I'm a huge fan of like wooded areas in video games\""]
["07:07,940","07:12,200","\"Sorry, this is whoa, that's a stinky little man\""]
["07:12,200","07:15,220","\"Is it that's a deer?\""]
["07:15,220","07:32,560","\"I apologize people if I if I let the\""]
["07:32,560","07:38,280","\"For speed ahead so I'm assuming because this game is called witch hunt you're hunting down a witch\""]
["07:38,280","07:45,400","\"Yeah, I think now you got just saying that because you played this and you know you know, oh, oh fuck what's happening?\""]
["07:45,400","07:48,000","\"Whoa, where is it? I don't know\""]
["07:48,000","07:53,200","\"All right, I don't actually know what's happening there. I think that was it\""]
["07:53,200","07:56,400","\"I think that was we get closer to something really yeah, I think so oh\""]
["07:58,360","08:03,760","\"Do you see anything? Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah, I guess you're not supposed to look in the direction of it or something\""]
["08:03,760","08:05,760","\"Yeah, don't look that way. I'm guessing\""]
["08:05,760","08:08,280","\"So it must be\""]
["08:08,280","08:16,320","\"Huh, I guess you're in its line of sight. I'm not sure. Oh, I think it's up there. These two head\""]
["08:16,320","08:21,720","\"Oh, no, oh, that's a dog. That's a dog\""]
["08:25,960","08:33,960","\"I'm kidding me. I forgot the reload. You did a reload. I give it a go until you die and we'll switch. Okay sure. That's stunk. Don't worry. That's how it goes.\""]
["08:33,960","08:41,960","\"That's what I wanted. Okay, I think I got a fairly good idea of it though. I wanted the experience where you go in and blind because it's this kind of a game.\""]
["08:41,960","08:48,960","\"This isn't a story driven game. You're literally supposed to just go in and explore. This game would be really interesting if you think.\""]
["08:48,960","08:52,960","\"It'd be fucking horrifying if you were. That's fine. You could put it on headphones.\""]
["08:52,960","08:54,960","\"You gotta reload like that.\""]
["08:54,960","08:55,960","\"*laughs*\""]
["08:55,960","08:58,960","\"It's honestly a really great way to kind of give suspense in a way.\""]
["08:58,960","08:59,960","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:59,960","09:00,960","\"In a natural way.\""]
["09:00,960","09:01,960","\"I'm running down the road.\""]
["09:01,960","09:02,960","\"So I think we're right.\""]
["09:02,960","09:06,960","\"I think from what I understand that is like the stupid static thing.\""]
["09:06,960","09:07,960","\"I think so.\""]
["09:07,960","09:09,960","\"I think you're not supposed to look in the direction of it.\""]
["09:09,960","09:10,960","\"And I may be wrong.\""]
["09:10,960","09:11,960","\"I'm not sure.\""]
["09:11,960","09:12,960","\"But I think...\""]
["09:12,960","09:13,960","\"What's the best to get?\""]
["09:13,960","09:14,960","\"The question is this.\""]
["09:14,960","09:15,960","\"Is that dog gonna be the same spider?\""]
["09:15,960","09:16,960","\"Is it all randomized?\""]
["09:16,960","09:17,960","\"I think it's randomized.\""]
["09:17,960","09:20,960","\"And I think because we're some kind of Van Helsingish...\""]
["09:20,960","09:26,000","\"Go left it see go up to that area. I was that earlier and see if you look at the area see if you get a sewer a\""]
["09:26,000","09:28,760","\"little a little red\""]
["09:28,760","09:30,920","\"Deal\""]
["09:30,920","09:35,340","\"Yeah, I look I was up here. I looked to the right beyond this rock and I got that little red thing. Oh\""]
["09:35,340","09:39,840","\"What's that?\""]
["09:39,840","09:42,040","\"Something is probably in this area\""]
["09:42,040","09:47,160","\"What the fuck was that\""]
["09:47,760","09:52,180","\"Did that say die yeah, I whispered something I don't know if it's a dive in whisper something I\""]
["09:52,180","09:57,320","\"Am not good at horror games. I don't I think I just heard the grudge\""]
["09:57,320","09:59,920","\"growl oh my god\""]
["09:59,920","10:02,720","\"That's what I like about this though. There's a lot of cool sounds\""]
["10:02,720","10:08,440","\"No, I think good. I was saying before I think good sound design is one of most important things in any piece of media\""]
["10:08,440","10:10,740","\"Yeah, cuz it puts your brain in the right mood\""]
["10:10,740","10:13,560","\"so\""]
["10:13,560","10:15,560","\"Where the fuck are we?\""]
["10:15,560","10:17,560","\"What the fuck is going to be?\""]
["10:17,560","10:19,560","\"What the fuck is... oh, okay\""]
["10:19,560","10:21,960","\"So what?\""]
["10:21,960","10:23,560","\"What does that mean?\""]
["10:23,560","10:25,560","\"Whoa, where is it?\""]
["10:25,560","10:26,560","\"Where?\""]
["10:26,560","10:29,560","\"Look at your little thing down there. I think you might be really towards it right now. Maybe not.\""]
["10:29,560","10:32,560","\"Aren't you supposed to head in the direction of it?\""]
["10:32,560","10:35,560","\"Oh, I think maybe you are. I- Oh my god. What's it doing?\""]
["10:35,560","10:37,560","\"Are we going the right way?\""]
["10:37,560","10:41,060","\"I've never actually ran into it.\""]
["10:41,060","10:42,560","\"Oh my god.\""]
["10:42,560","10:47,640","\"Now here's my quest to be guys skipped over to forgot it, but what that thing goes down. Do you lose health?\""]
["10:47,640","10:51,800","\"I think that's just my magic. It's like sappin my little magic my little magic sprites\""]
["10:51,800","10:55,720","\"How does that replenish just by killing something? I think so. Yeah. Oh\""]
["10:55,720","11:01,680","\"So I see see if it's such a little thing. So that way you have an idea of where it is. I guess so yeah\""]
["11:01,680","11:05,540","\"Fuck fuck fuck fuck what it was that? What was that?\""]
["11:05,540","11:10,880","\"Fuck you're by big ledge. So I can't be to what you I don't think where is it?\""]
["11:11,720","11:16,300","\"Is that the fucking witch what is that walk towards you fucking witch? Oh?\""]
["11:16,300","11:20,200","\"My god\""]

["11:44,920","11:48,340","\"There's a fucking that actually scared me.\""]
["11:48,340","11:52,240","\"Maybe we can see it from a high ground.\""]
["11:52,240","11:55,120","\"Do you know what the witch looks like?\""]
["11:55,120","11:56,320","\"I have no fucking idea.\""]
