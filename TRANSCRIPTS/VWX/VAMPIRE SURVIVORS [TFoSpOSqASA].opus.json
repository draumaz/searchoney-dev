["00:22,640","00:24,080","\"like kind of throw my girlfriend in the bus,\""]
["00:24,080","00:26,360","\"but I wasn't sure what to expect\""]
["00:26,360","00:27,920","\"'cause it kind of looks like a--\""]
["00:27,920","00:29,240","\"- When I say it again, expect.\""]
["00:29,240","00:30,080","\"Say that.\""]
["00:30,080","00:31,360","\"- What did I say?\""]
["00:31,360","00:33,360","\"- Of course you said I expect but say I expect.\""]
["00:33,360","00:35,440","\"- I wasn't expecting.\""]

["00:39,440","00:40,320","\"- So good.\""]
["00:40,320","00:41,680","\"- So good, but it's really addicting.\""]

["00:42,520","00:44,240","\"We're gonna start, you're gonna go, what?\""]

["00:48,240","00:50,360","\"- You guys sound so whipped right now.\""]
["00:50,360","00:53,040","\"- No, some broad tell to play a fucking game\""]
["00:53,040","00:53,880","\"and all of a sudden.\""]
["00:53,880","00:55,920","\"- I said really, this game is $2.\""]
["00:55,920","00:56,760","\"- This game is $2.\""]
["00:56,760","00:57,760","\"- This game is $2.\""]
["00:57,760","00:59,040","\"- Well, this game is $2, right?\""]
["00:59,040","01:03,680","\"I was like this can to be good and then I saw this and I saw this this right here\""]
["01:03,680","01:04,180","\"I was like okay\""]
["01:04,180","01:08,460","\"This is gonna suck and look all you can do is move left and right up and down and it auto\""]
["01:08,460","01:13,920","\"I hate these these suck, but then but then but then okay get hit by a bat\""]
["01:13,920","01:16,400","\"Well, what do you think your first jam?\""]
["01:16,400","01:24,100","\"Ready oh\""]
["01:24,100","01:28,480","\"Yeah, see and then get the laurel because you want the shield. I want the laurel\""]
["01:28,680","01:35,660","\"But you do want the book you want the king's Bible. Yeah, but anyway, this is literally the game and I know it doesn't look like much\""]
["01:35,660","01:38,680","\"But just wait you wait lyle. I can see you're already like\""]
["01:38,680","01:43,280","\"I'm not impressed so far. I'll fall asleep\""]
["01:43,280","01:48,000","\"That's how I was I was like this looks boring. No once it starts picking up\""]
["01:48,000","01:51,780","\"It will you will be overwhelmed in about two minutes literally\""]
["01:52,400","01:59,300","\"Fuck okay, here we go. Well, I'll just I could I could see this having like a risk of rain type appeal exactly that's what it is\""]
["01:59,300","02:06,900","\"Yeah, once you start getting cool power ups and leveling up again, so I think this game is made in game maker because all these enemies look like\""]
["02:06,900","02:13,880","\"Free assets from game. Ooh get PG on I like the Brinkie. Oh, no all these things are like directly from game maker\""]
["02:13,880","02:17,880","\"It feels like at least this looks like a game maker game doesn't it? Yes?\""]
["02:18,780","02:24,500","\"Like when you walk around the overworld and these are the things you fight in your turn-based little adventure with your little characters\""]
["02:24,500","02:31,700","\"Steam has a huge problem with really mediocre fucking game maker games once they started letting you like any game get on there\""]
["02:31,700","02:35,460","\"Yeah, there was no damage control. That was a bad idea. I you know\""]
["02:35,460","02:39,220","\"This is funny. There is a discovery queue on steam\""]
["02:39,220","02:44,300","\"And one day I decided I'm gonna go through to the discovery queue. So I decided to do it\""]
["02:44,300","02:50,580","\"I'm at like 10,000 games. I've looked over to my discovery queue. I used to be able to see the titles in my queue\""]
["02:50,580","02:56,260","\"I can't even see it anymore. It's like now my I have so many cues my fucking browser crashes sometimes\""]
["02:56,260","03:00,140","\"Thing crashes there was a week like\""]
["03:00,140","03:07,280","\"Firewall maybe maybe about a month ago where everyone was being recommended a game called Nazi furry\""]
["03:07,280","03:12,700","\"Oh that yeah, everyone did it got recommended to everybody\""]
["03:12,700","03:18,080","\"I don't like I was like what the hell why am I being recommended Nazi furry and it's like cuz you did\""]
["03:18,080","03:24,020","\"Could have been my deal my evil search history, but then Monica got recommended Nazi furry\""]
["03:24,020","03:31,780","\"And I see furries three times in the discory discovery queue\""]
["03:31,780","03:36,420","\"So I know you're talking and then I went on I went on fucking Twitter and like three people were like\""]
["03:36,420","03:38,700","\"What why am I being recommended?\""]
["03:39,220","03:46,500","\"Nazi furry and I was like oh so this is like a this is like an epidemic this is this is started. It's not going away\""]
["03:46,500","03:54,300","\"By the way, I have played Nazi furry. It's not that great. It's kind of a bland point-click game with really mediocre fuck scenes\""]
["03:54,300","03:58,380","\"I would not recommend it Nazi worth your time. Yeah, it's definitely not\""]
["03:58,380","04:08,360","\"I think Nazi furry is kind of mediocre, but you should probably check out furry party that one's pretty good\""]
["04:08,360","04:14,040","\"I've never heard of that one Corey why don't you delve into it okay so it's\""]
["04:14,040","04:17,120","\"literally what it is just a bunch of friends sitting around you fuck them\""]
["04:17,120","04:22,680","\"actually funny enough when you go through Discovery Q the most common game you\""]
["04:22,680","04:29,320","\"see if you have adult games open are these like nasty like gnarled 3d picture\""]
["04:29,320","04:33,920","\"picture games where it's just like single pictures that move like as as if\""]
["04:33,920","04:36,640","\"if you're watching a PowerPoint presentation.\""]
["04:36,640","04:39,480","\"And these fucking games have clouded\""]
["04:39,480","04:41,160","\"the goddamn Steam workshop.\""]
["04:41,160","04:42,800","\"Like if you look at the game,\""]
["04:42,800","04:46,320","\"it's literally like my naughty nurse fucking three.\""]
["04:46,320","04:48,760","\"And it's the same goddamn game as my naughty nurse too.\""]
["04:48,760","04:50,360","\"It's just a different fucking nurse and kids.\""]
["04:50,360","04:51,440","\"- It's the same thing.\""]
["04:51,440","04:54,520","\"- But the faces are like, I don't need,\""]
["04:54,520","04:55,360","\"what do you call it?\""]
["04:55,360","04:58,920","\"Like raytracing, I don't need raytracing on a fucking picture.\""]
["04:58,920","05:00,800","\"If there's like no gameplay to begin with,\""]
["05:00,800","05:05,040","\"And I don't care about generic 3D stuff that you've...\""]
["05:05,040","05:09,360","\"It's the kind of 3D stuff you would see if you go to a porn site, or if you click it,\""]
["05:09,360","05:11,680","\"you'd think you'd get like a malware on your computer.\""]
["05:11,680","05:13,240","\"Like it's that kind of game.\""]
["05:13,240","05:16,240","\"\"\"This Naruto game will make you come for eight-week videos.\"\"\""]
["05:16,240","05:17,240","\"Exactly!\""]
["05:17,240","05:20,400","\"And that has plagued the Steam workplace.\""]
["05:20,400","05:22,040","\"And there are a lot of games like that.\""]
["05:22,040","05:24,120","\"It's because Steam hasn't...\""]
["05:24,120","05:29,120","\"Now that you're on a green light, they can't stop these maniacs from fucking uploading\""]
["05:29,120","05:30,120","\"just trash.\""]
["05:30,120","05:36,160","\"Yeah, I feel like it's probably just become like content farm shit the same way those like Johnny Johnny yes pop-up videos\""]
["05:36,160","05:41,000","\"Yeah, company like steam. Can you not hire a few people to just sift through like sit down and just sit through it, huh?\""]
["05:41,000","05:43,360","\"Ten clock time clock. Oh wow\""]
["05:43,360","05:49,960","\"Have you been paying attention long yeah, what do you think is this a list game ever? It's a game\""]
["05:49,960","05:56,060","\"Come on love once you play it. You'll be like wait a minute angry at it your little brain will be like\""]
["05:56,760","06:00,500","\"Yeah, once you get into it you you will start you have heart\""]
["06:00,500","06:07,760","\"Politicians because you will be so terrified you will see these tiny little pixels coming in the fucking your life will flash before your eyes\""]
["06:07,760","06:12,560","\"This is everything I like about a game right here. This is what games were built for\""]
["06:12,560","06:17,760","\"This is all men think about and you don't have to do it's such a nice like nice game\""]
["06:17,760","06:20,420","\"You don't have to do anything you just a WASD and that's it\""]
["06:22,760","06:29,580","\"Can you take the fucking meme of like the woman looking over at the guys like I bet you's thinking of fucking another woman\""]
["06:29,580","06:32,220","\"And then have the guy just have like footage of the gameplay in here\""]
["06:32,220","06:37,520","\"Are those plants closing? Oh, that's not like the level border. Those are enemies. Yeah, they're bad\""]
["06:37,520","06:39,320","\"They're evil, but then they go away for a sec\""]
["06:39,320","06:44,140","\"I always love how the sprites they can't move their hands because they're forever stuck teaposing\""]
["06:44,140","06:47,280","\"Yeah, but they just sort of like on June on June late\""]
["06:47,280","06:50,360","\"Ooh\""]
["06:50,360","06:54,220","\"Okay word of the day you don't kind of rub it in all right you've never said a big word like that\""]
["06:54,220","06:59,860","\"How did you learn that if I do say a big word? It's usually a choreified way say the wrong version of it\""]
["06:59,860","07:03,280","\"That's very common. I can't help it like\""]
["07:03,280","07:07,060","\"I you should give me an example. I don't know\""]
["07:07,060","07:11,320","\"Like your word for develop is\""]
["07:11,320","07:14,920","\"Up-beat up-beat. Yeah\""]
["07:14,920","07:19,240","\"No, it would still be developed, but it would probably be like\""]
["07:19,720","07:25,320","\"Devol, shall I be saying like I got a divulge in that new game would do that when I meant to say develop Corey\""]
["07:25,320","07:32,280","\"I feel like if we just pushed you a little bit and got you a little bit smarter. You just be like a boring intelligent guy with like\""]
["07:32,280","07:35,600","\"reasonable opinions\""]
["07:35,600","07:38,040","\"You know the gladiates are reasonable\""]
["07:38,040","07:41,920","\"But I think they're just stupid enough to be funny\""]
["07:41,920","07:48,620","\"I bitch about the most like I bitch about the stuff that nobody would even think about caring about the thing that\""]
["07:48,620","07:54,760","\"Fox with me though is you're usually right though. Yeah, I tend to always be right. It's like it's a curse honestly\""]
["07:54,760","07:56,920","\"Cory's smart, but the way he says things\""]
["07:56,920","08:01,920","\"It's gonna be carved into my epitaph\""]
["08:01,920","08:05,400","\"Says dog\""]
["08:05,400","08:12,700","\"Say earlier you said something crazy. I forget what I was I can't even think for myself\""]
["08:12,700","08:16,720","\"Was it was it like super sexist wait go back and get that?\""]
["08:16,720","08:23,120","\"You're referencing like Forrest Gump or something I forget. Oh for his gum\""]
["08:23,120","08:26,800","\"I was like saying it like Forrest Gump had like he had like a\""]
["08:26,800","08:31,640","\"Terats where he had say like alive is like a big\""]
["08:31,640","08:39,000","\"Yeah, I kept saying that over and over as if he was like screaming in the parchment\""]
["08:39,000","08:40,040","\"I liked it\""]
["08:40,040","08:46,780","\"It didn't make sense in any context why first of all the people would leave they wouldn't sit next to Forrest Gump\""]
["08:46,780","08:50,320","\"If he kept on like it would just go you kind of ruin the tone of the movie\""]
["08:50,320","08:58,080","\"First of all I make the movie 20 times more funnier, but it would be over in five minutes\""]
["08:58,080","09:01,180","\"Because everyone would just stand up and walk away\""]
["09:01,180","09:06,440","\"Like when we were at the the outside place today, and it was this like skits so outside\""]
["09:06,440","09:11,060","\"Who's carrying? He kept going like he had headphones on plugged into the wall\""]
["09:11,060","09:15,460","\"He was stealing their electricity, but then he was like he was singing along to like a rap\""]
["09:15,460","09:20,880","\"And he's going like I thought he was but then it sounded like he was screaming. He was screaming\""]
["09:20,880","09:22,880","\"He was doing exactly that he's going\""]
["09:22,880","09:25,000","\"And then we walked out past him anyway\""]
["09:25,000","09:27,320","\"Hey, how's it going?\""]
["09:27,320","09:30,000","\"So fucking stupid\""]
["09:30,000","09:35,060","\"Expect us to turn around and be like oh us. Oh, we're doing great. Thank you. How are you doing?\""]
["09:35,060","09:41,060","\"I went to a Mexican restaurant with Tomar a little while ago and he's not Mexican. Yeah\""]
["09:41,060","09:43,700","\"I wanted to get him in some trouble\""]
["09:43,700","09:46,660","\"this fucking like weird\""]
["09:46,660","09:52,660","\"Person screaming in like a fucking um like a hospital gown\""]
["09:52,660","09:58,900","\"Walked by us and we were like were we just like side characters in like a fucking like\""]
["09:58,900","10:04,580","\"You know where it's just like we just craned our necks and just like looked at like what was that?\""]
["10:04,660","10:08,520","\"You know like yeah, like the village is escaping kind of yeah\""]
["10:08,520","10:12,940","\"It was literally a hot speed down to be honest today when we were going to get Starbucks\""]
["10:12,940","10:18,040","\"I thought I saw some dude who was in like the same guard from 28 days later because he he was wearing\""]
["10:18,040","10:21,760","\"He was wearing like a long-sleeve white shirt, but it had a bunch of words on it\""]
["10:21,760","10:28,520","\"Which was like I don't know religious doctrines. You know what it was like very if you're talking about the Starbucks\""]
["10:28,520","10:30,520","\"You guys usually go to like the one by the IHOP\""]
["10:31,180","10:34,300","\"Yes, the Mexican restaurant was literally right there\""]
["10:34,300","10:38,700","\"Yeah, he might roam those grounds\""]
["10:38,700","10:44,220","\"He looked like he was in it. It might have just been like the latest fashion\""]
["10:44,220","10:47,660","\"I don't know. I'm not really up on it, but then on the very same day\""]
["10:47,660","10:55,460","\"We were driving back and we saw like a woman with like big elephant legs like walking in the middle of the street\""]
["10:56,140","11:01,180","\"What like like shadow deformity yes, but she was walking like a\""]
["11:01,180","11:10,420","\"Club fate and I'm talking to like like big like major street. Oh she was just walking like dead center down the middle of it\""]
["11:10,420","11:16,260","\"So I don't know if like she's like an elephant on like the green African plains. Yeah, exactly\""]
["11:16,260","11:21,580","\"So I don't know if there was like a fucking oh fuck break at the mental ward that day or something\""]
["11:21,580","11:23,900","\"But it was probably it was within the same hour\""]
["11:23,900","11:27,800","\"We saw both those things people probably got let out a prison that day. That's probably what happened\""]
["11:27,800","11:30,820","\"Do they just do that? Okay?\""]
["11:30,820","11:35,500","\"Yes, they just like release people want to get through full get out of prison for good behavior\""]
["11:35,500","11:42,360","\"That's probably what they do. Look if you're a good a good little prison boy you get out early\""]
["11:42,360","11:47,620","\"So basically you can do whatever you like as long as you say sorry a lot\""]
["11:47,620","11:51,740","\"There's a giant mantis. Yes, you let me\""]
["11:52,580","11:55,500","\"So here's the thing Chris is level 15 and\""]
["11:55,500","12:00,540","\"He's got to kill enemies and that's where we are right now impressed\""]
["12:00,540","12:07,180","\"This is the whole game like right now Chris isn't really attacking. He's just walking and all attacking is happening. I\""]
["12:07,180","12:09,980","\"Like it though\""]
["12:09,980","12:11,980","\"Whip or damage\""]
["12:11,980","12:15,380","\"Whip you want to have a lot of whip okay\""]
["12:15,380","12:20,580","\"Because like if your whip is low you're not gonna be able to survive the dreaded boss fight\""]
["12:20,580","12:26,680","\"I really want there's this one item that it's like an orb you pick it up and it sucks all the coins in the game\""]
["12:26,680","12:31,320","\"Into you it's so cool. It sets off every all fucking alarm bells in your head\""]
["12:31,320","12:36,520","\"Is this one of those games where it just lets you get really broken? Yes, it can yeah the game is really hard\""]
["12:36,520","12:41,620","\"So it's like yeah, it balances itself out. It's not like you know another game. That's really interesting is noita\""]
["12:41,620","12:48,020","\"I didn't really know about that. Oh, yeah, so no Chris showed me it and Chris made some fucking insane broken runs like\""]
["12:48,340","12:53,860","\"Chris Chris made a run where he had a fucking he had a he had magic that created water\""]
["12:53,860","12:57,860","\"So he could flood the entire place then he also turned into electricity\""]
["12:57,860","13:01,260","\"So we could fucking murder and maim everybody and just melt face\""]
["13:01,260","13:05,020","\"But the only problem was Chris couldn't swim so he was stuck in his own hell\""]

["16:38,160","16:43,820","\"But I ended up screwing myself and becoming a delinquent as far as like credit scores go and I fucked myself\""]
["16:43,820","16:45,920","\"And that stuff doesn't go for go away for years, but\""]
["16:45,920","16:50,280","\"Recently I got a credit card and I was too afraid to use credit and like build credit\""]
["16:50,280","16:51,960","\"But then I\""]
["16:51,960","16:56,600","\"Needed a new bed because our my back was like fucked up and so I was like alright when you knew bed\""]
["16:56,600","17:03,120","\"It's way too expensive. I'm just gonna use a credit card and buy it and what credit essentially is is it's like it just goes\""]
["17:03,120","17:05,720","\"Into a big money pile. I thought I would have to worry about a lot of stuff\""]
["17:05,720","17:09,040","\"But it basically goes into you only have a certain amount of limited money\""]
["17:09,040","17:12,520","\"It goes into them. I mean as long as you can pay it off. Yeah, exactly\""]
["17:12,520","17:18,000","\"But you don't have to pay it all off you just have like they give you a certain percentage to pay off\""]
["17:18,000","17:20,280","\"They're like pay off like $25 a month\""]
["17:20,280","17:22,240","\"And then you just pay it off $25 a month\""]
["17:22,240","17:24,500","\"but I usually pay off like 100 a month.\""]
["17:24,500","17:27,380","\"And when you do that and you don't pay it all off,\""]
["17:27,380","17:28,900","\"you build credit really fast.\""]
["17:28,900","17:32,440","\"- Yes, that's one thing that I learned about credit.\""]
["17:32,440","17:35,420","\"I don't know if this is the fucking forum for this,\""]
["17:35,420","17:38,980","\"but one of the things I learned about credit\""]
["17:38,980","17:41,100","\"'cause I have like kind of garbage credit.\""]
["17:41,100","17:42,140","\"And I was like, what the fuck?\""]
["17:42,140","17:44,340","\"Like I was using my card and just paying it all off.\""]
["17:44,340","17:45,180","\"- Yeah, you don't wanna do that.\""]
["17:45,180","17:47,800","\"- And then like I kind of got into some financial trouble\""]
["17:47,800","17:50,740","\"and like let my credit kind of get shit\""]
["17:50,740","17:52,300","\"and it accrued some fees.\""]
["17:52,300","17:53,140","\"- Yes.\""]
["17:53,140","17:54,260","\"- And then I started paying that off\""]
["17:54,260","17:56,340","\"and then my credit went way through the roof.\""]
["17:56,340","17:57,180","\"- Really?\""]
["17:57,180","17:58,020","\"- Yeah.\""]
["17:58,020","17:58,860","\"- So it was like, yeah, I was like,\""]
["17:58,860","17:59,700","\"are you shitting me?\""]
["17:59,700","18:01,900","\"Like the time I fucked up is what built my credit.\""]
["18:01,900","18:02,740","\"- Exactly.\""]
["18:02,740","18:04,780","\"- And that's how I learned it was all bullshit.\""]
["18:04,780","18:05,620","\"- It is all bullshit.\""]
["18:05,620","18:06,460","\"- It is all bullshit.\""]
["18:06,460","18:07,300","\"- It is all bullshit.\""]
["18:07,300","18:08,140","\"You know why?\""]
["18:08,140","18:08,900","\"Because I didn't have credit for like 10 years\""]
["18:08,900","18:10,500","\"and then one year I had perfect credit.\""]
["18:10,500","18:12,100","\"I don't understand, I don't even know what happened.\""]
["18:12,100","18:13,220","\"- I don't really get credit.\""]
["18:13,220","18:14,780","\"It has to do something like,\""]
["18:14,780","18:18,220","\"it's better to have worse credit\""]
["18:18,220","18:20,220","\"because in the future you can get better credit\""]
["18:20,220","18:22,540","\"because it's like they, it's like you're in the system.\""]
["18:22,540","18:23,440","\"- This is great financial advice.\""]
["18:23,440","18:24,520","\"- I don't know how to explain it.\""]
["18:24,520","18:26,340","\"I always need to link when, because they didn't pay off.\""]
["18:26,340","18:27,900","\"- Guys, just make sure to fuck up early.\""]
["18:27,900","18:28,740","\"- Yeah, then you'll be good.\""]
["18:28,740","18:29,580","\"- Fuck up early.\""]
["18:29,580","18:31,500","\"Get delinquency so you fuck your credit up\""]
["18:31,500","18:33,260","\"so you can't find any place to live.\""]
["18:33,260","18:34,100","\"- Well, I'm gonna try a little.\""]
["18:34,100","18:35,100","\"- Just pay a squatter.\""]
["18:35,100","18:39,060","\"And then you can build your credit better and faster\""]
["18:39,060","18:40,540","\"and that's how you hack the system.\""]
["18:40,540","18:42,820","\"- No one's gonna take financial advice from you, Corey.\""]
["18:42,820","18:43,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["18:43,660","18:45,340","\"- Why not?\""]
["18:45,340","18:46,900","\"I'm a financial issue.\""]
["18:46,900","18:50,180","\"- You should start like a self-help book, like for sure.\""]
["18:50,180","18:54,060","\"For sure for sure, but I think I think right now right now\""]
["18:54,060","18:59,700","\"This is like credit for dummies like I'm not telling you like what you should I'm just saying you need to tell you the rules\""]
["18:59,700","19:05,460","\"You need to work out you need to get buff and then you start you need to start having controversial opinions on Twitter\""]
["19:05,460","19:08,260","\"And then that's when you start like espousing these opinions\""]
["19:08,260","19:12,700","\"I can't do that and then someone will pay you like six hundred dollars a month for it. It's not worth it\""]
["19:12,700","19:16,820","\"Well, look at them go because like no one would believe me\""]
["19:17,620","19:22,820","\"They would if you were I believe you Corey no no you know what I love about this game. Oh, maybe they would\""]

["19:25,660","19:31,480","\"I love how much shit is on screen, but I don't think that this would they wouldn't be able to do this with two players with so much shit on\""]
["19:31,480","19:35,640","\"Screen no this could not be done with two that's really sad because this would be so fun with two people\""]
["19:35,640","19:39,520","\"I think you guys are thinking pretty small. I think you could easily do this\""]
["19:39,520","19:44,180","\"I don't think you can because one more thing on screen get the crossbow\""]
["19:44,860","19:49,580","\"Well, then the game has to keep track of both things through or get the cross on both people's screens\""]
["19:49,580","19:53,420","\"And guess it's a lot of shit going on I\""]
["19:53,420","19:56,740","\"Do they do left for dead and shit\""]
