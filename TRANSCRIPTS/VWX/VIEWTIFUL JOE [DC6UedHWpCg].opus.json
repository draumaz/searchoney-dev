["05:02,300","05:04,300","\"I think that would go over really well\""]
["05:05,140","05:07,580","\"- Do you ever feel like being a game developer\""]
["05:07,580","05:08,820","\"that you were born in the wrong time\""]
["05:08,820","05:11,580","\"where making stuff for PS2 would have been kind of\""]
["05:11,580","05:13,180","\"easier and more fun?\""]
["05:13,180","05:15,300","\"- Absolutely amazing to make a game like this.\""]
["05:15,300","05:17,020","\"- Well, it would be easier for the coders way harder\""]
["05:17,020","05:17,860","\"but for the artists. - No, it'd be like\""]
["05:17,860","05:19,820","\"too fun. - For the 3D guys.\""]
["05:19,820","05:22,260","\"- I feel like, I mean, indie games are definitely\""]
["05:22,260","05:24,140","\"in a better spot because a lot of people\""]
["05:24,140","05:25,940","\"are looking at indie games for like,\""]
["05:25,940","05:28,100","\"they're just tired of like AAA releases.\""]
["05:28,100","05:28,940","\"- No.\""]
["05:28,940","05:31,820","\"- But like, a lot of these old games,\""]
["05:31,820","05:34,020","\"like this would be an indie game, I feel.\""]
["05:34,020","05:36,620","\"You could make this in five minutes now.\""]
["05:36,620","05:37,580","\"Yeah, there's--\""]
["05:37,580","05:39,300","\"But nobody does.\""]
["05:39,300","05:41,980","\"But I mean, these games are like the style, the aesthetic.\""]
["05:41,980","05:45,860","\"It's like, even if you have a simple beat 'em up style,\""]
["05:45,860","05:48,260","\"all you got to do is really accentuate it.\""]
["05:48,260","05:50,100","\"Like, if you have a cool idea, like, own it.\""]
["05:50,100","05:50,940","\"He's wearing a tooth.\""]
["05:50,940","05:54,340","\"Like, here's the thing, Neon White has a great style.\""]
["05:54,340","05:56,420","\"It is a fantastic style.\""]
["05:56,420","05:57,820","\"It knows what it is.\""]
["05:57,820","06:00,700","\"It's just that the writing is horrendous.\""]
["06:00,700","06:02,260","\"That's the trade-off.\""]
["06:02,260","06:04,860","\"It's a fun game, but it's the worst writing in existence.\""]
["06:04,860","06:06,820","\"They should have hired me to write it.\""]
["06:06,820","06:09,300","\"Yeah, I would have put more obvious checkstrokes.\""]
["06:09,300","06:10,820","\"I want to put me in it.\""]
["06:10,820","06:14,020","\"And I would have said inappropriate things, and I would have said like fuck.\""]
["06:14,020","06:16,660","\"Dude, I want to pull shit out of his galley button.\""]
["06:16,660","06:18,540","\"Beat him up. Beat up the guy.\""]

["06:23,100","06:24,700","\"Oh, what a precious...\""]
["06:24,700","06:25,700","\"What?\""]
["06:25,700","06:29,140","\"Oh, good. All right. All right.\""]
["06:29,140","06:31,060","\"That was unfair by technicality.\""]
["06:31,060","06:31,900","\"Did that...\""]
["06:31,900","06:34,220","\"Oh, I thought it like changed the shaders for a second.\""]
["06:34,220","06:36,620","\"I think Dolphin just tried to fuck you over.\""]
["06:36,620","06:39,020","\"It was tired of how good you were doing while.\""]
["06:39,020","06:40,380","\"Yeah, it saw.\""]
["06:40,380","06:43,940","\"It heard me say that thing about being a Panther-themed superhero.\""]
["06:43,940","06:45,180","\"It was like, \"\"Panther!\"\"\""]
["06:45,180","06:47,020","\"He can't get to the part of that game.\""]
["06:47,020","06:52,900","\"That's his Power Rangers move, right?\""]
["06:52,900","06:53,700","\"Yeah.\""]

["07:05,920","07:09,920","\"I actually vividly remember ripping off this art style when I was a kid.\""]
["07:09,920","07:11,920","\"I would draw superheroes exactly like that.\""]

["07:13,920","07:15,920","\"Was it called \"\"Bitch Man\"\"?\""]
["07:15,920","07:16,920","\"He was really cool.\""]
