["00:02,480","00:12,920","\"With friends what the fuck you got to follow the plan man\""]
["00:12,920","00:18,800","\"That just launched like directly into it that fly has a scheme what a lightweight game\""]
["00:18,800","00:22,640","\"Hey wait a minute Tomar that's you why?\""]
["00:22,640","00:26,400","\"Starting it now. Oh\""]
["00:27,160","00:34,400","\"God, it's got all his little are you the fly and you've got but a day to live and make it count. I guess oh, oh\""]
["00:34,400","00:40,200","\"Well, that's all you need. Okay, so it's is it all 2d or oh?\""]
["00:40,200","00:46,680","\"Wow, I mean it's obviously 3d, but you know what I mean like 2d perspective. No, this is real\""]
["00:46,680","00:49,220","\"This is a two-point fly to you game. Oh\""]
["00:49,220","00:52,000","\"Look, I make a little trail\""]
["00:52,000","00:56,920","\"Man, this is based on a real historical figure. That's leafy in the background\""]
["00:56,920","01:00,000","\"it is\""]
["01:00,000","01:02,480","\"You're the fly going to eat his corpse\""]
["01:02,480","01:08,480","\"Lay eggs in his eyes. That's really mean. There's like no need for that at all cares\""]
["01:08,480","01:15,040","\"There's no need for that loll. I know there's not a need but there is a want what the fuck?\""]
["01:15,040","01:17,640","\"It's a fly quake dude get out of there\""]
["01:17,640","01:21,520","\"Yeah, what is that supposed to be happening?\""]
["01:21,520","01:24,300","\"I bet it is. I bet there's a bird coming or some shit\""]
["01:24,300","01:28,200","\"Whoa wind oh it sucks to be a fly\""]
["01:28,200","01:31,200","\"There we go you're back on it\""]
["01:31,200","01:38,400","\"So me and Monica have this this ongoing argument and maybe maybe you guys can help settle the score sure\""]
["01:38,400","01:43,340","\"I was saying that it's more likely. Yeah, I tried that, but she just wouldn't listen\""]
["01:43,340","01:48,920","\"But yeah, no, so you tried everything. I just drop it. I know\""]
["01:49,880","01:58,120","\"So we have this argument where I am saying that it's more likely for a fly to show up on the first floor of the house\""]
["01:58,120","02:02,380","\"Yeah, because that's like kind of the area that they fly in\""]
["02:02,380","02:06,600","\"Yeah, and Monica seems to think that a fly can just fly up\""]
["02:06,600","02:13,160","\"infinitely and like get into like she thinks they can make it up to where planes are and stuff I\""]
["02:13,160","02:19,620","\"Mean I don't know. I don't think a fly could handle the the airspeed\""]
["02:19,620","02:21,260","\"at that, like-\""]
["02:21,260","02:22,740","\"- Or the count.\""]
["02:22,740","02:23,580","\"- Like I think there-\""]
["02:23,580","02:25,540","\"- Yeah, there's a lot of things that get you up\""]
["02:25,540","02:28,940","\"where planes fly, like 10,000 feet plus.\""]
["02:28,940","02:30,980","\"- Yeah, I mean, I'm sure one can get like caught\""]
["02:30,980","02:33,500","\"in the wind and get up there dead,\""]
["02:33,500","02:37,500","\"but I like that there's like a whole bird layer\""]
["02:37,500","02:39,660","\"that they have to get past where like birds are\""]
["02:39,660","02:40,500","\"that would eat them.\""]
["02:40,500","02:42,580","\"- I was gonna say if there were a ton of flies up there\""]
["02:42,580","02:44,860","\"then like every plane landing at the airport\""]
["02:44,860","02:47,500","\"would be covered in flies all over the front, wouldn't it?\""]
["02:47,500","02:49,140","\"- Thank you.\""]
["02:49,140","02:50,900","\"See, this is what I was saying, but she was saying,\""]
["02:50,900","02:54,180","\"no, that the flies are just as likely to get upstairs\""]
["02:54,180","02:55,820","\"as they are downstairs.\""]
["02:55,820","02:57,460","\"- Well, she's upstairs the down layer.\""]
["02:57,460","02:59,300","\"- The burn layer isn't real, apparently.\""]
["02:59,300","03:00,900","\"- You got nail clippers at home?\""]
["03:00,900","03:01,740","\"- Yeah.\""]
["03:01,740","03:03,260","\"- Next time she's sleeping.\""]
["03:03,260","03:04,340","\"- Cut her nails?\""]
["03:04,340","03:06,180","\"- Pull out the ol' eyelids.\""]
["03:06,180","03:08,020","\"- She's tired now.\""]
["03:08,020","03:11,140","\"And then unleash 50 flies and see if she likes it.\""]
["03:11,140","03:13,420","\"- I don't think I want to be right that bad,\""]
["03:13,420","03:14,700","\"but I know that I am.\""]
["03:14,700","03:16,940","\"- I don't know about the airplane argument proving\""]
["03:16,940","03:20,000","\"that they can't make it to like the second story\""]
["03:20,000","03:21,500","\"of a house or something though.\""]
["03:21,500","03:22,660","\"Like what is this?\""]
["03:22,660","03:25,060","\"What do you, what do you,\""]
["03:25,060","03:27,700","\"what was the whole upstairs downstairs part?\""]
["03:27,700","03:31,820","\"- I was, so the argument started when we saw fly upstairs\""]
["03:31,820","03:33,180","\"and I was like, that's weird.\""]
["03:33,180","03:35,340","\"Like they shouldn't be,\""]
["03:35,340","03:37,180","\"you'd think they wouldn't be that high up.\""]
["03:37,180","03:40,140","\"Like it was like on our ceiling upstairs.\""]
["03:40,140","03:42,620","\"- One floor up is not that far for a bug.\""]
["03:42,620","03:44,420","\"- For a fly, I don't think it makes it,\""]
["03:44,420","03:45,900","\"that it cares about.\""]
["03:45,900","03:47,900","\"Especially for a bug that can fly.\""]
["03:47,900","03:51,900","\"I'd say up to a few hundred feet, it probably wouldn't make a big difference to the fly.\""]
["03:51,900","03:53,900","\"Well I said something like, \"\"Oh, it must have come up the stairs.\"\"\""]
["03:53,900","03:56,900","\"And Monica said, \"\"It probably just flew through the window, you idiot.\"\"\""]
["03:56,900","03:57,900","\"And I was like, \"\"No.\"\"\""]
["03:57,900","03:59,900","\"That's not gonna just fly through the window.\""]
["03:59,900","04:01,900","\"That's like right touching the bird layer.\""]
["04:01,900","04:04,900","\"What is this game gonna fucking start?\""]
["04:04,900","04:10,900","\"I like this concept of the bird layer, but I don't think Monica's necessarily raw.\""]
["04:10,900","04:14,900","\"I think the fly could totally fly in a second or even third story window.\""]
["04:14,900","04:18,060","\"How did I argue you out of a ring with me?\""]
["04:18,060","04:20,060","\"Why is this so emotional?\""]
["04:20,060","04:24,940","\"Because we're sad because your initial argument involved an airplay versus a set of\""]
["04:24,940","04:31,740","\"Fuck it. It's sad because you're about to hit the bird layer. That's why it's sad. This thing's about to lose its life\""]
["04:31,740","04:36,700","\"Yeah, we're in like treetop zone. This is taking itself really seriously\""]
["04:36,700","04:40,380","\"Wait, is the purpose of this to just fly as high as humanly possible?\""]
["04:40,380","04:44,220","\"I'm just getting angry at this game. You know what this game might settle the argument\""]
["04:44,220","04:46,220","\"Oh\""]
["04:46,220","04:49,340","\"At least we have that to look forward\""]
["04:49,340","04:51,500","\"What are these ghost orbs?\""]
["04:51,500","04:57,460","\"Every single one has the spirit of someone's grandma is there like like I've been barely like\""]
["04:57,460","05:02,260","\"We've just been flying up. Yes. There's been no other activity you're able to do\""]
["05:02,260","05:06,740","\"I think this is an art game like journey. We're gonna get to the top of the mountain and the game's gonna be over. Okay\""]
["05:06,740","05:09,260","\"Now it's in space. No\""]
["05:09,260","05:12,540","\"I don't\""]
["05:12,420","05:17,780","\"Wait, just the beautiful night sky we were wrong. Yeah, I guess I\""]
["05:17,780","05:25,020","\"Can't believe I made it to the horse head nib you I don't know how I feel about a person who makes a fly games knowledge of I\""]
["05:25,020","05:29,060","\"Was really excited for this game. I literally was the one who wanted to play this\""]
["05:29,060","05:32,740","\"I thought we were gonna be flying around in a fucking bug utopia and meeting\""]
["05:32,740","05:38,340","\"This was gonna be like a more advanced version of mr. Mosquito. I think I'm literally going to heaven right now\""]
["05:39,620","05:43,420","\"It turns out the fly can go higher than previously thought oh\""]
["05:43,420","05:52,120","\"Jesus just spit on me. You're gonna fly up gods your ears ends upward from the flat earth into the very heavens themselves\""]
["05:52,120","05:55,060","\"The music's nice\""]
["05:55,060","06:02,620","\"It is but it's fucking screaming at us. It's like not worth a fly. Look at that massive shadow you're casting straight downward\""]
["06:02,620","06:05,780","\"That must mean I'm surrounded by lots of volumetric\""]
["06:06,140","06:12,700","\"Maybe this guy was just playing really loud violin. Oh my god. Is it the order video? Oh no fuck off\""]
["06:12,700","06:17,660","\"That's so stupid. There's not a bulb at the top of the woods\""]
["06:17,660","06:23,700","\"Yeah, the world you can't fucking pull the blanket wait. I'm gonna type something I\""]
["06:23,700","06:26,020","\"am\""]
["06:26,020","06:28,020","\"fly\""]
["06:28,020","06:30,020","\"See you meet die\""]
["06:30,860","06:32,860","\"What I'm gonna fucking punch this\""]
["06:32,860","06:36,260","\"Wait, wait, that is better. What why did you type?\""]
["06:36,260","06:43,180","\"Because there was a clicking cursor there was a cursor are each one of these stars in the sky another fly\""]
["06:43,180","06:47,320","\"What was the point of that you do each shit is a fly? This actually cost money\""]
["06:47,320","06:50,060","\"Did you okay?\""]
["06:50,060","06:53,080","\"But it costs time that's worse\""]
["06:53,080","06:58,620","\"I'll never get time back. I can make money you can make flies. I\""]
["06:59,340","07:05,020","\"Just want we could have made a real fly in this very house. Do you think that there are other endings?\""]
["07:05,020","07:10,980","\"Oh, yeah, there's maybe a horizontal ending too. I thought it sort of locked us in horizontally\""]
["07:10,980","07:15,820","\"Oh wait, is that all the wind does is prevent you from flying too far horizontally? I think\""]
["07:15,820","07:18,300","\"Wait go the other way. Maybe there's a secret\""]
["07:18,300","07:24,380","\"Maybe there's a gamer's chest a guy who made this just put a bunch of spiders and bugs in and then it'll be fine\""]
["07:24,380","07:31,220","\"Yeah, have a spider swing in on on a spider web and fucking catch you actually wait you did get caught in a spider web at one point\""]
["07:31,220","07:35,220","\"Didn't you yeah? Well have a have to have that happen twice\""]
["07:35,220","07:41,340","\"And have a little guy in a swing dangling from you screaming at you. Yeah, you should maybe have like\""]
["07:41,340","07:47,940","\"Little no yeah a little appution just why you lost no oh\""]
["07:47,940","07:50,500","\"You can bring that back to the colony\""]
["07:51,980","07:57,280","\"To flies have colonies they have taste all right. I feel like we've seen it all\""]
["07:57,280","08:00,220","\"Okay, I've got a good ending question\""]
["08:00,220","08:03,820","\"Okay, how bad you feel killing a fly?\""]
["08:03,820","08:09,020","\"Not how bad you feel killing one trillion flies\""]
["08:09,020","08:14,500","\"Are you saying like there's a quantity of flies that amounts to a human life not a human life?\""]
["08:14,500","08:18,140","\"But then it's got a way you die. Yeah, let's just stay\""]
["08:18,340","08:21,740","\"There's got to be an amount of flies that you kill where you genuinely feel upset\""]
["08:21,740","08:28,800","\"Um well, I don't know about that because you'd think if there was like a huge swarm of them they'd freak you out\""]
["08:28,800","08:38,660","\"Okay, well what if you're saying how many pounds of fly flesh on my floor would start to make me feel uncomfortable with the decision to kill them\""]
["08:38,660","08:39,140","\"Yeah\""]
["08:39,140","08:43,100","\"What if you're standing at the edge of the universe looking in and there's just a big cube a glass\""]
["08:43,300","08:49,080","\"Cube of like a trillion flies and you've got the power to snap your fingers and Thanos said into a big dust pile\""]
["08:49,080","08:53,700","\"Yeah, that'd be fun. I wouldn't feel bad. They're just flies\""]
["08:53,700","08:58,000","\"Please each row the big glass cube of flies at somebody\""]
["08:58,000","09:04,140","\"Can you drop it like off off like a freeway overpass and just freak someone out a trillion flies?\""]
["09:04,140","09:06,300","\"I would kill like 15 laris\""]
["09:08,820","09:09,660","\"- Team Lari.\""]
["09:09,660","09:12,820","\"- Yeah, and their innards, the human innards.\""]
["09:12,820","09:14,980","\"- Maybe this is a record, this is the first time\""]
["09:14,980","09:17,060","\"that we were able to beat the same game twice\""]
["09:17,060","09:18,380","\"on a single playthrough.\""]
["09:18,380","09:20,700","\"- Oh yeah, we're speedrunning at this point.\""]
["09:20,700","09:22,740","\"- I'm just seeing if anything else happens.\""]
["09:22,740","09:25,800","\"I mean, what are we supposed to type in at the NY?\""]
["09:25,800","09:29,500","\"- I'm sure that somebody gets that message.\""]
["09:29,500","09:33,100","\"- Yeah, maybe the whole point of that is just\""]
["09:33,100","09:35,940","\"to tell the developer that you finished it\""]
["09:35,940","09:38,140","\"and that you had some feelings.\""]
["09:38,140","09:43,420","\"That's emailing him I like the spinach. How about the thing about the spinach? What's the spinach?\""]
["09:43,420","09:48,300","\"They've trained spinach to send emails. No what yeah, they've trained spinach\""]
["09:48,300","09:53,220","\"They got a little clicker and they got some treats and then it doesn't have a keyboard spinach\""]
["09:53,220","09:57,340","\"Can email you and you can't stop it\""]
["09:57,340","10:04,260","\"Did did you just make that up good little spinach email right now and tell me I'm a liar\""]
["10:04,260","10:09,680","\"I'm trying to understand how you'd even come up with the lie that we you're fucking stupid\""]
["10:09,680","10:13,380","\"Hold on. I'm gonna look. I'm gonna googles you're just spinach\""]
["10:13,380","10:20,780","\"Yeah, I got spinach as a pen pal before you got fake news someone came up to you said you know email can be spinach\""]
["10:20,780","10:27,980","\"You're like wow that sounds really two days ago scientists just spinach how to send emails to help make climate change\""]
["10:27,980","10:31,060","\"Okay, okay, okay, this isn't a joke. I\""]
["10:31,860","10:37,620","\"I know that if I look into this, it's going to be just a headline for sensationalism.\""]
["10:37,620","10:38,900","\"Do you eat spinach?\""]
["10:38,900","10:45,780","\"And you need a new method for detecting major changes in our climate, thanks to the root systems\""]
["10:45,780","10:52,260","\"of spinach plants. Plants are very environmentally responsive. Baba. So they can predict it's drought\""]
["10:52,260","10:58,660","\"prediction. I'm not going to read this whole article, but I imagine it's just they have sensors\""]
["10:59,300","11:05,240","\"Hooked up to some spinach plants and when they reach a certain thing it sends an email\""]
["11:05,240","11:09,280","\"But if it can send an email surely it has a soul Tomar\""]
["11:09,280","11:13,900","\"It's observable like the weather I\""]
["11:13,900","11:16,140","\"Like the human condition\""]
["11:16,140","11:23,340","\"It's like saying they taught clouds how to send an email because you have an application that can notify you about the weather\""]
["11:23,340","11:25,740","\"Well here\""]
["11:25,740","11:30,660","\"We'll see if that email goes to the next fly in the line. Oh, you're the North Star\""]
["11:30,660","11:38,100","\"It went away. I think whatever you type at the end this time type it assuming that it goes straight to the developer\""]
["11:38,100","11:44,460","\"Yeah, give him a piece of your mind. Okay. I wonder what the music is it for this? What it's really good\""]
["11:44,460","11:49,340","\"It says what the music is in the opening credits. Oh, it's it's a song called\""]
["11:49,340","11:53,340","\"Well, we'll find out when it restarts again\""]
["11:53,700","11:57,260","\"Okay, but yeah, why is there just a light bulb in this guy?\""]
["11:57,260","12:05,020","\"So that light bulb is fucking giant. Is that a metaphorical light bulb? I think it's heaven. I also wonder if there's a character limit\""]
["12:05,020","12:09,420","\"Hey creator\""]
["12:09,420","12:13,820","\"Nice fly experience, but\""]
["12:20,900","12:25,140","\"wish he had more leave him drooling for more fuck this.\""]
["12:25,140","12:26,480","\"Yeah, that's disappointing.\""]
["12:26,480","12:27,740","\"Honestly, there's gonna be a better flag.\""]
["12:27,740","12:31,580","\"You wanted to see what the song is for your reference.\""]
["12:31,580","12:32,700","\"Where is it?\""]
["12:32,700","12:33,980","\"It'll come up there.\""]
["12:33,980","12:38,980","\"The death of a sa sa, written by Edvard Greek,\""]

["12:45,020","12:45,860","\"What is this?\""]
["12:45,860","12:50,060","\"It means he actually stole this idea from another guy.\""]
["12:50,060","12:56,420","\"You stole the fly didn't still be I do okay. Yeah, maybe he's saying the fly model came from that guy\""]
["12:56,420","12:59,140","\"That's fair enough is there any other fly games?\""]
["12:59,140","13:07,460","\"This one looks good. It's gonna buy a little fly. Okay. It's gonna be a full screen it does it scale? Oh you get to choose your\""]
