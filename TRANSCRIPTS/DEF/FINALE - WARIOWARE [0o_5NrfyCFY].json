["00:22,880","00:27,680","\"and the first VHS I see on their shelf is called Teeny Tiny and The Witch Woman.\""]

["00:30,240","00:31,040","\"That sounds really goofy.\""]
["00:31,040","00:34,480","\"So we put it in and it starts off and it is unbelievably stupid.\""]
["00:34,480","00:38,000","\"It's this kid and he's wearing stupid hat and he's got two stupid brothers\""]
["00:38,000","00:41,600","\"and their parents specifically say, \"\"Don't go into the woods. There's a witch.\"\"\""]
["00:41,600","00:45,520","\"So what do they do? They go into the woods where they meet a b-\""]
["00:45,520","00:46,880","\"horrifyingly scary witch.\""]
["00:46,880","00:50,480","\"I was surprised at how like disturbed by this witch Chris was.\""]

["00:53,280","00:56,560","\"Yeah, she has a white picket fence made of human bones\""]
["00:56,560","00:59,040","\"And there's skulls lining the pathway up to her door.\""]
["00:59,040","01:00,040","\"- The kids are smiling.\""]
["01:00,040","01:01,480","\"They're really excited to go in.\""]

["01:08,680","01:09,520","\"She's like, \"\"Kuh.\"\"\""]
["01:09,520","01:10,720","\"So her voice is leery.\""]

["01:22,320","01:23,880","\"- She's like, \"\"Call me Andy.\"\"\""]
["01:23,880","01:25,080","\"And then they're like,\""]
["01:25,080","01:27,240","\"Guess we can come in and then taney-ton is like\""]
["01:27,240","01:35,840","\"And then they bring her in and then they all go to bed upstairs and the witch is trying to fucking like she's sharpening her blade\""]
["01:35,840","01:37,840","\"As she talks to them and she looks\""]
["01:37,840","01:46,080","\"I got caught off guard. I'm sorry. She looks so scary. It's on it's and the music is like a scary fucking like drone\""]

["01:48,560","01:52,880","\"It's like I can't believe a kid could watch this and not like\""]
["01:53,680","01:58,340","\"Throw a fucking toaster into the tub when they're done. That's how you react to fear\""]
["01:58,340","02:05,060","\"I mean, that's all there is to it you throw the toaster in the tub and he leaves the room\""]
["02:05,060","02:08,080","\"But yeah, no that movie is scary. I\""]
["02:08,080","02:14,820","\"Was expecting it to be like oh, yeah, it starts off and all you see is a real old woman's hands\""]
["02:14,820","02:19,400","\"Oh, yeah, I guess the black backdrop and she's done and she sounds peaceful. Yeah, she's like\""]
["02:19,400","02:29,380","\"I'm going to tell you what story was. I have called teeny time and you just see these like nice hands just like rubbing together and like and like explaining and then\""]

["02:37,200","02:45,320","\"You told the story Chris. Yeah, it's true. You came true. Oh, I came true. You told the story. It's gonna be passed down\""]
["02:45,440","02:50,360","\"It looks so fucking scary. I'm very happy you liked it. I like all that old stuff\""]
["02:50,360","02:54,360","\"We were talking about how like when we were kids in the 90s there was a lot of like\""]
["02:54,360","02:57,940","\"Shows and stuff that was like just oh, we're gonna\""]
["02:57,940","03:01,340","\"We're gonna play we're gonna just show shots of\""]
["03:01,340","03:04,420","\"Like a children's booker. We're gonna like animate it\""]
["03:04,420","03:08,400","\"And so it was one of those and they usually have a lot of interesting stuff in there\""]
["03:08,400","03:14,320","\"Teeny tiny was animated pretty okay. It was I like I said, I like it a lot so I was happy that you enjoyed it\""]
["03:14,320","03:16,320","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:16,320","03:18,320","\"Lately.\""]
["03:18,320","03:19,320","\"Oh.\""]
["03:19,320","03:24,320","\"You want to talk about the new CGI Rugrats?\""]
["03:24,320","03:26,320","\"I haven't seen it.\""]
["03:26,320","03:28,320","\"I avoided it on purpose.\""]
["03:28,320","03:29,320","\"It looks very ugly.\""]
["03:29,320","03:31,320","\"I can't believe you got away with that, Julian.\""]
["03:31,320","03:33,320","\"Yeah, that looked like I should have died.\""]
["03:33,320","03:36,320","\"But I imagine it's just a low budget affair,\""]
["03:36,320","03:37,320","\"is what it seems like.\""]
["03:37,320","03:39,320","\"So, good.\""]
["03:39,320","03:40,320","\"I don't.\""]
["03:40,320","03:41,320","\"Good luck to that one.\""]
["03:41,320","03:42,320","\"I didn't think that one counted.\""]
["03:42,320","03:44,920","\"Was anyone really demanding a new Rugrats?\""]
["03:44,920","03:45,920","\"Uhh...\""]
["03:45,920","03:49,300","\"Cause I think the truest spirit of that show was like the first few seasons when I was\""]
["03:49,300","03:51,300","\"trying to be more like a Simpsons originally.\""]
["03:51,300","03:52,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:52,300","03:53,300","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:53,300","03:56,840","\"I only heard that for the first time recently that it wasn't even about the babies at first.\""]
["03:56,840","03:58,400","\"It was about the adults, right?\""]
["03:58,400","04:00,840","\"It's pretty heavily focused around the adults in some of the episodes.\""]
["04:00,840","04:02,640","\"Yeah, I know, and those were the better episodes.\""]
["04:02,640","04:03,640","\"I would say.\""]
["04:03,640","04:05,200","\"Oh shit, I thought it was the cat!\""]
["04:05,200","04:06,200","\"Oh, man.\""]
["04:06,200","04:07,200","\"Oh, no!\""]

["04:13,880","04:23,440","\"No see that one it that one doesn't count, huh? It does if you're in the air\""]
["04:23,440","04:29,640","\"Ding-dong you play too bad. Yeah, I'll pass it over. I feel like when you die. That's a good time to do it\""]
["04:29,640","04:34,200","\"I like that. He says that when you restart you are so persistent\""]
["04:34,200","04:36,880","\"Say something\""]
["04:36,880","04:41,520","\"Say something that one fucking that's not fair scary\""]
["04:41,520","04:50,480","\"It's interesting how stressful how stressful this manages to feel when you're playing even though the music is so calm, it's true\""]
["04:50,480","04:55,880","\"I like this song a lot though. It's cool. I remember when I was a kid playing this part\""]
["04:55,880","04:59,100","\"Like it really took me off. Did you play this on target yard?\""]
["04:59,100","05:02,840","\"Yeah, all the time if I was taking a road trip, I'd be playing this\""]
["05:03,360","05:08,100","\"The song sounds like is that a kill bill or something? Yeah, it sounds like that nice\""]
["05:08,100","05:11,560","\"That song\""]
["05:11,560","05:15,560","\"That's uh the grand duel. No, you're thinking a whaling woman\""]
["05:15,560","05:21,320","\"Yeah, they're on the album. There's a two-minute audio of a woman whaling. She called the whaling woman\""]
["05:21,320","05:26,080","\"Then they put it in a car commercial\""]
["05:26,080","05:28,000","\"They sure did\""]
["05:28,000","05:30,000","\"Really? Yeah all the time\""]

["05:38,280","05:41,120","\"Did Kill Bill make that song famous?\""]
["05:41,120","05:42,120","\"- I think so.\""]
["05:42,120","05:43,280","\"- 'Cause my dad started singing it.\""]
["05:43,280","05:45,360","\"- I forget the story behind a Tarantino\""]

["05:47,920","05:49,960","\"just before leaving Japan and heard that playing\""]
["05:49,960","05:52,680","\"and wanted to find if you could get the album\""]
["05:52,680","05:54,360","\"because he liked them a lot.\""]
["05:54,360","05:56,800","\"So he like looked up who they were.\""]
["05:56,800","05:58,400","\"It was something like that.\""]
["05:58,400","05:59,880","\"- That's cool.\""]
["05:59,880","06:06,600","\"kill bills good is it is a fine film and as a fine film it's too bad they killed\""]
["06:06,600","06:13,440","\"bill now there can never be a sequel it should have been thrilled to because\""]

["06:59,700","07:02,780","\"You can just go back and play these as much as you want.\""]
