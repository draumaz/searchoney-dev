["02:56,180","03:03,140","\"Okay invaders him you can stop being an alien now all I'm saying is they could have got me to do it\""]
["03:03,140","03:07,060","\"I would have done a 20 million times better. Let's mute his audio and you'll say what he says right now\""]
["03:07,060","03:10,460","\"But I lost contact okay\""]
["03:10,460","03:16,160","\"I actually do like that better now here in the crypto one three six do a hostile plan\""]
["03:16,160","03:21,600","\"That has to be just a Jack Nicholson impression, right? Yeah, I think it is Jack Nicholson. I like it suits him\""]

["03:41,440","03:42,440","\"Ha ha ha!\""]
["03:42,440","03:47,840","\"\"\"Of course I'm right, you kidding me? A crypto-sparidium captured by a bunch of monkeys!\"\"\""]
["03:47,840","03:50,320","\"The reason is big open in the metallic room with no reverb.\""]
["03:50,320","03:51,980","\"\"\"We gotta crack some uranium!\"\"\""]
["03:51,980","03:53,980","\"\"\"He's talking to Xbox Live headset.\"\"\""]
["03:53,980","03:56,780","\"It does sound very tinny, I'm just saying.\""]
["03:56,780","04:00,320","\"\"\"I think all the original audio is from the original game.\"\"\""]
["04:00,320","04:03,480","\"You know what, I'm actually glad they did do that. It is weird they didn't put a reverb\""]
["04:03,480","04:04,480","\"on it, at least.\""]
["04:04,480","04:07,700","\"\"\"How bad would the audio quality be for PS2 game if you took all the...\"\"\""]
["04:07,700","04:09,800","\"They compressed it a lot for the ps2\""]
["04:09,800","04:17,460","\"Doesn't send that back I wonder if they have the source files or whatever because like you'd think oh\""]
["04:17,460","04:22,340","\"But of course a professional company would hold all the files and the magical little vault\""]
["04:22,340","04:25,380","\"No, that was what happened with the Kingdom Hearts one\""]
["04:25,380","04:32,140","\"They remastered Kingdom Hearts, and they basically remade the whole entire game because they didn't have any of the original assets\""]
["04:32,140","04:37,620","\"Yes, some companies just forget or they just yeah, or they like I imagine you probably do it to save space\""]
["04:37,620","04:43,040","\"You don't need the original destroy humans audio in 2009. Yeah, I was like five years old by that point whatever\""]
["04:43,040","04:50,680","\"I mean like if you died tomorrow and someone had to continue what you're working on even if they had your hard drive and shit\""]
["04:50,680","04:56,000","\"They'd be like god. I'm just I got a sort through all this weird butthole porn and fuck it like\""]
["04:56,000","05:03,660","\"They'd say I gotta sort through all this totally normal butthole\""]
["05:04,760","05:07,960","\"In 83% of countries including the one we're currently in,\""]
["05:07,960","05:11,380","\"this butthole porn that's legal in our current jurisdiction,\""]
["05:11,380","05:13,180","\"there's so much of it.\""]
["05:13,180","05:14,020","\"Why?\""]
["05:14,020","05:17,500","\"It's fucked to like, find something on someone else's computer.\""]
["05:17,500","05:18,820","\"Yeah, I won't be--\""]
["05:18,820","05:19,740","\"Like, this is--\""]
["05:19,740","05:20,740","\"I love what we realized.\""]
["05:20,740","05:22,380","\"We haven't even gotten to the first mission yet,\""]
["05:22,380","05:24,420","\"and we're already talking about butthole porn.\""]
["05:24,420","05:27,820","\"Yeah, this game actually goes into that topic.\""]
["05:27,820","05:30,060","\"It does, this guy, this guy is an investigative--\""]
["05:30,060","05:33,060","\"This is really weird, I know this is a brand new game,\""]
["05:33,060","05:35,460","\"But this is exactly how I remember it visually.\""]
["05:35,460","05:36,300","\"- Yeah, me too.\""]
["05:36,300","05:37,740","\"That's probably because your kid brain\""]
["05:37,740","05:38,580","\"filled with everything.\""]
["05:38,580","05:40,340","\"Yeah, this is exactly what I remember.\""]
["05:40,340","05:44,380","\"- Also, am I dumb?\""]
["05:44,380","05:45,220","\"- Yeah.\""]
["05:45,220","05:46,060","\"- Okay.\""]
["05:46,060","05:46,900","\"- He had.\""]
["05:46,900","05:51,340","\"- But on top of that, I could have sworn like,\""]
["05:51,340","05:53,380","\"just the lower resolution and everything.\""]
["05:53,380","05:55,500","\"Like things didn't have to look this good\""]
["05:55,500","05:56,940","\"to look this good.\""]
["05:56,940","05:57,780","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["05:57,780","05:59,180","\"- Because of the old TVs.\""]
["05:59,180","06:00,420","\"- Right, yeah.\""]
["06:00,420","06:02,100","\"I feel like if you just scaled up\""]
["06:02,100","06:04,900","\"the original game, it would look really, really fucking terrible.\""]
["06:04,900","06:07,820","\"But if you scaled down this and put it on an old TV,\""]
["06:07,820","06:09,660","\"it probably wouldn't look that much better.\""]
["06:09,660","06:14,020","\"I remember there was a really brief two years where--\""]
["06:14,020","06:15,740","\"remember when GTA 4 came out?\""]
["06:15,740","06:16,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:16,240","06:18,540","\"I played it on my CRT, and I was like, this looks real.\""]
["06:18,540","06:20,700","\"And then we got our first HDTV, and I was like,\""]
["06:20,700","06:22,540","\"I can't fucking wait to see how this looks.\""]
["06:22,540","06:23,740","\"It looked horrible.\""]
["06:23,740","06:26,060","\"And I was like, wow, I hate HDTVs.\""]
["06:26,060","06:26,560","\"These suck.\""]
["06:26,560","06:28,380","\"And I hated them for two whole years.\""]
["06:28,380","06:31,940","\"I had exactly the same experience.\""]
["06:31,940","06:37,040","\"Also, your parents are my parents. Is that a real brothers? Yeah, age you're attached by the feet\""]
["06:37,040","06:41,340","\"We don't look the same your Puerto Rican or something. Yeah, well, we're different to me\""]
["06:41,340","06:46,220","\"We're really really long congenital twins. We're not the same dude. Okay. Keep telling\""]
["06:46,220","06:49,300","\"Look at this little fucking gray\""]
["06:49,300","06:53,100","\"Movement I love moving\""]
["06:53,100","06:58,480","\"Now that we've moved I feel like there's not much else to do you cover like 90% of the game\""]
["06:59,300","07:03,720","\"Just by moving so I played this game at e3\""]
["07:03,720","07:10,180","\"- and you didn't I I went to one of them and I hated it. It was like the worst thing I ever did\""]
["07:10,180","07:14,580","\"Yeah, I kind of I go one day. That's that's what I typically do. Mm-hmm\""]
["07:14,580","07:20,420","\"It's like carvacotta just go one day and see five thousand sweaty people coffee and spinach each other and you leave\""]
["07:20,420","07:22,420","\"Yeah, you buy some cool stuff\""]
["07:22,420","07:25,380","\"We can read this cow's brain\""]
["07:25,380","07:27,860","\"But can you write it?\""]
["07:28,460","07:30,460","\"He's thinking move\""]
["07:30,460","07:37,860","\"I kissed it. Did you kiss the actual cow? Mm-hmm\""]
["07:37,860","07:46,860","\"Attention Earth creatures. This planet is now part of the furan empire your benevolent masters. Welcome you that sounds\""]
["07:46,860","07:52,340","\"I think we all have to read I'm not kidding dude. It would sound fine if they put reverb on it\""]
["07:52,340","07:55,060","\"Yeah, I think you could actually clean a lot of this up by by tricking it\""]
["07:55,860","08:00,120","\"You can also bury with them the just like ambient noise I bet I\""]
["08:00,120","08:02,900","\"Think they also they could have like\""]
["08:02,900","08:06,360","\"Made this look old-timey and like\""]
["08:06,360","08:12,500","\"1960s like if they put like a little bit of a filter on it or something that shit looks delicious\""]
["08:12,500","08:14,500","\"So what are you saying?\""]
["08:14,500","08:16,580","\"Actually, fuck that was nice\""]

["08:21,620","08:23,900","\"Fuck I wish that was my face behind that cow\""]
["08:24,620","08:32,940","\"There's got to be someone that had some sort of horrid sexual awakening from like Ace of Intera or something where it crawls out of the rhinos ass\""]
["08:32,940","08:42,540","\"Some 11 year old somewhere saw that would oh yeah, that's that's right\""]
["08:42,540","08:44,660","\"I I think it's literally there\""]
["08:44,660","08:50,500","\"There's like a day when you're on the cusp of puberty and when you flip over the first thing you see is what you're like\""]
["08:50,500","08:54,920","\"Actually attracted to for the rest of your life. So if you if you happen to cross\""]
["08:54,920","08:59,580","\"Like something bad if you're walking down a path and see something horrible\""]
["08:59,580","09:02,380","\"Better hope that's that's why they suggest\""]
["09:02,380","09:08,020","\"Psychiatrists always suggest you lock your 12 year olds in a blank white room for five years\""]
["09:08,020","09:13,120","\"Yeah with with just tits and butts all over the wall. Yeah, so they're in the old\""]

["09:31,500","09:35,020","\"I assume because this remake got made I\""]
["09:35,020","09:38,320","\"Assume they're they're thinking about doing more of this right?\""]
["09:38,320","09:46,240","\"I mean there was a few games maybe yeah, there were I think three and the third one by the time the third one rolled around\""]
["09:46,240","09:52,260","\"No one even knew it came out the second one. I knew about but the third one idea. Yeah, I also I had a friend\""]
["09:52,260","09:54,960","\"I think you've told us through before but I every time I think about this game I think about\""]
["09:54,960","09:57,720","\"By a 11 year old friend who shoppled to this game\""]
["09:57,720","10:06,400","\"She talking about mr. Ed you're here mr. Ed the horse\""]
["10:06,400","10:09,440","\"It's just the talking horse\""]
["10:13,360","10:17,460","\"That does make it a lot more morbid if the horses like sentient\""]
["10:17,460","10:23,960","\"Cuz it's new what it was doing those old like 1960s shows are so fucking stupid\""]
["10:23,960","10:28,360","\"I don't like watch them watch them like I don't watch episodes on episodes\""]
["10:28,360","10:33,160","\"But every time I've seen some garbage fucking show or movie from the 1960s\""]
["10:33,160","10:41,080","\"That was just like some forgotten schlock or just some some piece of shit like dude the Adam West Batman movie is actually like\""]
["10:41,760","10:45,220","\"Brilliant it's so good because it's just so shockingly it's so\""]
["10:45,220","10:50,940","\"absurdly dumb yeah, like mr. Ed the whole fucking premise is like it was a horse that was like\""]
["10:50,940","10:57,040","\"And they made like 40 seasons of it. It just went on for fucking ever\""]
["10:57,040","10:59,960","\"Yeah, dude that show guns smoke made like a thousand episodes\""]
["10:59,960","11:07,320","\"I think literally I over a thousand in like ten years or something. Oh dude lassi lassi the whole premise of lassi is there's a dog\""]
["11:07,320","11:11,700","\"That's it there's a dog in a bar setting a couple times. I can use my jet pad\""]
["11:11,700","11:13,140","\"I\""]

["11:28,400","11:30,660","\"Was hat fell off\""]
["11:30,660","11:34,880","\"This is uh, this is one of the games. I think that made me not like half-life\""]
["11:34,880","11:36,820","\"Really? Yeah\""]
["11:36,820","11:41,360","\"Because in this game you can pick up fucking cars and people and shit and I played it first\""]
["11:41,360","11:46,780","\"It is that that the case of the half life you can you can pick up like anything\""]
["11:46,780","11:51,980","\"Copicops and stuff like little stuff. Yeah, you can pick up like a garbage can and smaller basically\""]
["11:51,980","11:56,180","\"I see so in this game you can full-on like pick up dudes and throw them\""]
["11:56,180","12:00,300","\"Like before I played half life. I played this I played Psyops\""]
["12:00,300","12:06,800","\"And I played I played that fucking Star Wars game and in all of those games you can full-on pick up like people\""]

["12:09,280","12:13,600","\"How does that feel flight of the around good?\""]
["12:13,600","12:16,960","\"How does the game feel look at that?\""]
["12:16,960","12:25,400","\"Every gamer in their mind has a catalog of video games better than any triple-a developer could create\""]
["12:25,400","12:30,200","\"It's so true cuz we are the gamers Chris key draw like Stewie Griffin or something other grass\""]
