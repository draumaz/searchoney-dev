["00:12,560","00:16,160","\"Welcome to \"\"There is no connection.\"\"\""]
["00:16,160","00:18,120","\"No, probably this was an indie game.\""]
["00:18,120","00:19,840","\"Yeah, this one's a classic.\""]
["00:19,840","00:21,320","\"This is a classic game.\""]
["00:21,320","00:23,240","\"I'm playing first.\""]
["00:23,240","00:26,640","\"They say that Shigeru Miyamoto, when he was making this,\""]
["00:26,640","00:29,760","\"he didn't sleep for 48 days.\""]
["00:29,760","00:32,080","\"He started seeing phantoms.\""]
["00:32,080","00:33,520","\"Should we make it bigger or smaller?\""]
["00:33,520","00:34,320","\"What do you think?\""]
["00:34,320","00:35,160","\"Make it higher.\""]
["00:35,160","00:36,160","\"Perfect size.\""]
["00:36,160","00:37,760","\"We could get like two pixels by two pixels.\""]
["00:37,760","00:38,240","\"Can I pause?\""]
["00:38,240","00:41,920","\"Yeah, the resolution it was originally intended for.\""]
["00:41,920","00:43,360","\"I want to pause it, but I don't know if I can.\""]
["00:43,360","00:45,920","\"People these days, they're all about their HD ports,\""]
["00:45,920","00:48,000","\"but people don't remember--\""]
["00:48,000","00:48,480","\"OK, wait.\""]
["00:48,480","00:49,760","\"I'm going to pause it.\""]
["00:49,760","00:50,240","\"OK, let's--\""]
["00:50,240","00:51,080","\"There we go.\""]
["00:51,080","00:51,400","\"I was like--\""]
["00:51,400","00:55,280","\"Just like the classic CRT it was meant to be played on.\""]
["00:55,280","00:56,880","\"I literally cannot see that.\""]
["00:56,880","00:57,600","\"My vision saw.\""]
["00:57,600","00:59,040","\"I see little-- I see pixels.\""]
["00:59,040","01:03,860","\"I literally see like one pixel by one big so I want to see how long I can go for in this is\""]
["01:03,860","01:11,520","\"The resolution at which it was originally intended. I've got fucking horrendous eyes. Yeah, I can't say I need a lace\""]
["01:11,520","01:15,520","\"Or something that literally looks like dots to be it looks like two little scout ants jumping up and down\""]
["01:15,520","01:18,240","\"What is your obsession with scouting?\""]
["01:18,240","01:20,240","\"It's not an obsession\""]
["01:20,240","01:24,520","\"I just said it one minute before we started recording you all gave me shit for it because you're just like oh yeah\""]
["01:24,520","01:28,800","\"The tactical drone of the answers has been extinguished. Yeah\""]
["01:28,800","01:34,060","\"That is a scary cut with a little a good always friends about what he saw. Yeah, you're here talking about how he was doing like\""]
["01:34,060","01:41,860","\"Antreconnesons and if that ain't she's we're waiting back the information and tells the other ants. Are you telling me that scout ants aren't real?\""]
["01:41,860","01:48,700","\"Are you telling me that? I'm not telling you that. Mmm. I'm seems like you're right in the middle on this issue, Lyle. Yeah\""]
["01:48,700","01:56,100","\"Switzerland here, you're on the wrong side of history buddy. Oh, what the fuck what the fuck yeah\""]
["01:56,100","02:00,080","\"This game was the first game ever to incorporate a day-night cycle. Did you not know that?\""]
["02:00,080","02:07,300","\"I- oh my god. We should zoom right in on this tiny pixelated version for the viewer. This is crazy.\""]
["02:07,300","02:10,060","\"NOOOOOOO!\""]
["02:10,060","02:11,380","\"Okay, should I just make it bigger?\""]
["02:11,380","02:12,820","\"Don't make it bigger than small.\""]
["02:12,820","02:14,820","\"Let's make it the biggest it can possibly be.\""]
["02:14,820","02:17,140","\"That's as big as it can go.\""]
["02:17,140","02:18,140","\"500%.\""]
["02:18,140","02:19,660","\"Look, you got killed by a pterodactyl.\""]
["02:19,660","02:20,660","\"This is like crazy white screen.\""]
["02:20,660","02:22,660","\"It's actually pronounced pterodactyls act.\""]
["02:22,660","02:24,660","\"I think it's called pittututu.\""]
["02:24,660","02:25,660","\"It's called-\""]
["02:25,660","02:28,660","\"He's a funny little dinosaur.\""]

["02:31,660","02:33,660","\"Who wants to go after me?\""]
["02:33,660","02:35,660","\"You want to go after him?\""]
["02:35,660","02:37,660","\"You want to go after me?\""]
["02:37,660","02:39,660","\"I fucking love the dinosaur game.\""]
["02:39,660","02:44,660","\"My favorite thing about dinosaurs is that they're all dead like I am inside.\""]
["02:44,660","02:47,660","\"Well, if you did a HD version of this.\""]
["02:47,660","02:51,660","\"I would have a giant fucking CGI T-Rex screaming at Lauren.\""]
["02:51,660","02:53,660","\"[Laughing]\""]
["02:53,660","02:57,740","\"Really enhance this really cool. You should remake this game in blender\""]
["02:57,740","03:03,260","\"I would be epic make like a put a metal track by the sure that he walks just like that though\""]
["03:03,260","03:06,160","\"Have this fucking legs like retracted to his body\""]
["03:06,160","03:15,400","\"This is something I really want to see actually I played it. Yeah fucking cool ass fucking desert storm behind it like mad\""]
["03:15,400","03:20,420","\"This is a storm. Oh fuck you got all look at his eyes. He's in fear here\""]
["03:21,260","03:27,580","\"Pop-dot low you go. All right. Oh you you go. Oh god. There is no internet connection. There is no hope go back up\""]
["03:27,580","03:29,580","\"Fucking scroll arrow keys up\""]
["03:29,580","03:37,900","\"What the working jumping what the fuck here? I'll help you go there we go look yeah, you're right is I does open up\""]
["03:37,900","03:39,900","\"When you can't chase my mouse dude\""]
["03:51,020","03:53,020","\"This is what killed the dinosaurs Chris.\""]
["03:53,020","03:54,480","\"*laughs* A little cursor.\""]
["03:54,480","03:58,700","\"Yeah, a little cursor came out of nowhere and they were just trying to jump over the cacti in peace.\""]
["03:58,700","04:03,820","\"You know, the cacti didn't evolve until millions of years after the dinos were already gone.\""]
["04:03,820","04:05,180","\"This game is inaccurate.\""]
["04:05,180","04:12,180","\"Well that's probably then pitchforks and that's the devil trying to claim the mighty T-Rex gotten favorite creature.\""]
["04:12,180","04:18,700","\"When I was 14 I saw a YouTube video that said not only was the earth young but there were still dinosores in South America.\""]
["04:18,700","04:19,300","\"I'm not joking.\""]
["04:19,300","04:20,260","\"Wait, what?\""]
["04:20,260","04:21,860","\"He said there's still a lot of lactylosauruses.\""]
["04:21,860","04:24,100","\"That's funny, but I also thought you were going to say,\""]
["04:24,100","04:26,540","\"when I was young, I saw a Utah Raptor.\""]
["04:26,540","04:29,540","\"I did.\""]
["04:29,540","04:33,140","\"I saw this exact image, and I saw it quite--\""]
["04:33,140","04:34,900","\"Here's a funny joke.\""]
["04:34,900","04:35,700","\"Here's a funny original joke.\""]
["04:35,700","04:37,300","\"I want to hear what it is.\""]
["04:37,300","04:39,100","\"Like a Utah Raptor, instead of eating you,\""]
["04:39,100","04:42,220","\"it tries converting you to Mormonism.\""]
["04:42,220","04:43,540","\"And then it eats you right.\""]
["04:43,540","04:46,820","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["04:46,820","04:47,780","\"Oh.\""]

["04:50,860","04:52,940","\"- No, no, no, you f*ck it!\""]
["04:52,940","04:55,180","\"- You literally darked, you literally docked it\""]
["04:55,180","04:57,180","\"with a paterodactyl, you suck egg.\""]
["04:57,180","05:00,780","\"- Fine, let's see you do it, let's see how the pro does it.\""]
["05:00,780","05:01,620","\"There is no interest.\""]
["05:01,620","05:02,940","\"- By the way, can I just point to that something\""]
["05:02,940","05:03,940","\"really f*ckin' funny?\""]
["05:03,940","05:08,220","\"- Adam Sandler from Pixel's take on his veritable Pac-Man.\""]
["05:08,220","05:10,100","\"- All you viewers at home, if you're listening to this\""]
["05:10,100","05:11,180","\"and you're actually looking at the screen,\""]
["05:11,180","05:12,700","\"please look at the word \"\"high\"\" right there,\""]
["05:12,700","05:14,620","\"'cause that's making me smile over here.\""]
["05:14,620","05:16,780","\"It's making me think of weed and stuff like that.\""]
["05:16,780","05:18,860","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:18,860","05:20,860","\"The dinosaur's face looks like...\""]
["05:20,860","05:23,860","\"Yeah, he looks fucking like he's been drunk.\""]
["05:23,860","05:25,860","\"He's been shot with 17 darts.\""]
["05:25,860","05:29,860","\"What if in reality this is a normal bird who got shot with a dart?\""]
["05:29,860","05:32,860","\"Game theory, what if this was a chicken that was jumping?\""]
["05:32,860","05:36,860","\"This bird got hit with a... with a hidden dart.\""]
["05:36,860","05:38,860","\"This bird got hit with a bow and arrow.\""]
["05:38,860","05:41,860","\"Game theory is a dinosaur.\""]
["05:41,860","05:43,860","\"Can Luigi...\""]
["05:43,860","05:44,860","\"...on the hand side?\""]

["05:48,860","05:49,860","\"I don't know what he sounds like.\""]
["05:49,860","05:50,860","\"Kinda.\""]
["05:50,860","05:51,860","\"It's not a pressure to anybody.\""]
["05:51,860","05:56,860","\"To find the real answer, I had to calculate the circumference of Luigi's butt hole.\""]
["05:56,860","05:57,860","\"That's fucking spot on.\""]
["05:57,860","06:01,860","\"*music*\""]
["06:01,860","06:05,860","\"You know if Scrooge McDuck dived into a pile of coins, he wouldn't actually enjoy it that much.\""]

["06:10,860","06:12,860","\"That was the- that was a parody.\""]
["06:12,860","06:14,860","\"That literally- I'm not joking, that's a real failing guy joke.\""]
["06:14,860","06:17,620","\"When was that family guy joke season four?\""]
["06:17,620","06:20,020","\"- No, that was like season, it was the first episode.\""]
["06:20,020","06:21,020","\"- That was the pilot.\""]

["06:21,860","06:23,540","\"- No, you're lying, that was season four.\""]
["06:23,540","06:24,740","\"- No, that was like season 12.\""]
["06:24,740","06:25,580","\"Fuck!\""]
["06:25,580","06:27,540","\"- Yeah, most family guy jokes that are like\""]
["06:27,540","06:30,240","\"really obvious jokes like that are done,\""]
["06:30,240","06:34,740","\"like suspiciously long after everybody\""]
["06:34,740","06:35,580","\"is thought of the joke.\""]
["06:35,580","06:36,420","\"- It was like a season 12 joke,\""]
["06:36,420","06:38,620","\"he jumps into the pile and he goes, \"\"This is not--\"\"\""]
["06:38,620","06:40,980","\"- So in other words, there was definitely\""]
["06:40,980","06:43,140","\"like at least 12 internet cartoons\""]
["06:43,140","06:44,580","\"with that exact joke by that point.\""]
["06:44,580","06:49,940","\"Probably more than that. Hey you guys check this out, right? This is gonna be crazy. Don't do it whenever Zack jumps\""]
["06:49,940","06:52,940","\"I'm gonna make it look like he's staying on the spot. Okay, you ready?\""]
["06:52,940","06:55,700","\"shit\""]
["06:55,700","07:00,740","\"I'm trying to make it look like real impressive\""]
["07:00,740","07:06,620","\"This is the extreme version. Oh, this is what I'm supposed to be doing. Okay, here we go. There we go\""]
["07:06,620","07:08,620","\"What the fuck I see what you do\""]
["07:11,300","07:13,640","\"This game has a dynamic camera now\""]
["07:13,640","07:17,720","\"I had really scary music right now. This is fun\""]
["07:17,720","07:21,980","\"Look I did it that time that was pretty good. Look at this. Oh\""]
["07:21,980","07:26,520","\"My god, I'm getting fucking amazing at this\""]
["07:26,520","07:35,800","\"Let them just watch over us pixelated for a while\""]
["07:38,040","07:43,820","\"This is great. This is this nature intended. Do you think this is the best video we've ever done? Probably\""]
["07:43,820","07:52,220","\"Can we uh can we motion track something here can we motion track this seven right here there we go\""]
["07:52,220","07:55,360","\"That looks good. I\""]
["07:55,360","07:57,460","\"Think I could compete turbids at this point\""]
["07:57,460","08:05,340","\"If what I'm asking you this genuinely because I have to edit this wouldn't motion tracking the seven just it would literally not change any\""]
["08:05,340","08:11,180","\"Yeah, it would be a nice thing. It wouldn't it. Yeah, it looked great. Wow. You're really good at motion track\""]
["08:11,180","08:12,380","\"You did I know well\""]
["08:12,380","08:16,700","\"Can you motion track this thing whatever the fuck it is? Yeah? Oh, can you motion track the cursor?\""]
["08:16,700","08:20,060","\"That might be a little bit of work, but sure\""]
["08:20,060","08:26,620","\"Okay motion track the circle now go again motion track that whoa\""]
["08:26,620","08:28,300","\"Whoa?\""]

["08:32,460","08:38,360","\"Damn it. Well, there we go. Okay. Do you want me to do jump vision for you to do whatever the fuck you want to do my friend?\""]
["08:38,360","08:43,580","\"Chris you should make that is genuinely disoriented here. Let's see if you can play from here\""]
["08:43,580","08:50,260","\"Are that joking you should make this the longest running series make this like 30 episodes and piss everybody off\""]
["08:50,260","08:52,260","\"It's me\""]
["08:52,260","08:54,260","\"I'll get very angry\""]
["08:57,180","09:03,680","\"Don't worry everybody we've discontinued Jack and Daxter to play this we've discontinued every series\""]
["09:03,680","09:05,680","\"We've never been cancelled for this\""]

["09:12,880","09:18,980","\"It's us or this game and he said well now they're gone forever because of this game literally fucking dead\""]
["09:18,980","09:22,980","\"That's not true. Hey listen see this see this see this guy\""]
["09:23,420","09:28,260","\"Well, yeah, I want you to green screen so that everything inside him is tiny husband\""]
["09:28,260","09:37,040","\"Everything inside the cactuses and probably like the line on the letters probably also be tiny\""]
["09:37,040","09:40,780","\"Alright, I've got a great idea. I'm gonna make sure you can see what's going on\""]
["09:40,780","09:43,220","\"So you got a mosaic it so it's repeating over and over\""]
["09:43,220","09:47,540","\"Replace a dinosaur tiny husband running to the side\""]
["09:51,260","09:55,420","\"That's kind of hard Zach trust me. I know what I'm not doing\""]
["09:55,420","10:02,740","\"Wait, tiny husband if you have the source green screen footage of yourself from that epic video. Please please send it to us\""]
["10:02,740","10:08,220","\"Have we um who's got the highest score so far? I haven't been paying attention. Damn it\""]
["10:08,220","10:11,700","\"I got up there. I think we've all got delight time. I think\""]
["10:11,700","10:19,740","\"I think actually the highest score was like that first run you did. Well, I'll still plan by the way\""]
["10:19,740","10:23,180","\"That's what he says when he jump\""]
["10:23,180","10:28,460","\"Can we stop burping directly like that's very I mean we could have done that at any point\""]
["10:28,460","10:34,660","\"I think it's kind of a staple of only plays at this point. No somebody burping loudly and staple of all shitty lights play\""]
["10:34,660","10:39,700","\"Everyone's quiet cuz it's true\""]
["10:39,700","10:45,820","\"What else can we say about this game, huh?\""]
["10:45,820","10:50,860","\"I can tell you the fact that Chris Bors revamped his channel and he's bringing I ever give her back. It's true. Is that real?\""]
["10:50,860","10:54,360","\"That's true. We've been like two days ago. Holy shit. It wasn't for April Fool's\""]
["10:54,360","10:57,300","\"It's real is this gonna be the first game that he gets I rate about oh\""]
["10:57,300","11:03,340","\"Really ahead of the curve gonna get I rate it as subscribers not viewing his content anymore\""]
["11:03,340","11:06,920","\"Also, you know what pisses me the fuck off in these pixel games\""]
["11:06,920","11:13,380","\"We're glad your gears when the pixels don't align with each other like I don't you like they're all like different like sizes\""]
["11:13,380","11:18,860","\"Yeah, there's these white squares on his feet that aren't aligning with the ground and is pissing me off\""]
["11:18,860","11:24,480","\"Also the thickness of the actual stuff. I guess it's pretty uniform. I want to do one more run you you check it out\""]
["11:24,480","11:29,660","\"I'm gonna do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at look at the look at the pixel like size of the dinosaur versus the background\""]
["11:29,660","11:32,820","\"Oh, yeah, that's freaking pissing me. They're way bigger fucking picture\""]
