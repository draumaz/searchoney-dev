["00:00,000","00:05,600","\"Hey viewers, good news. Dingdong grinded for like a day.\""]
["00:05,600","00:06,900","\"For like 12 hours.\""]
["00:06,900","00:07,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:07,400","00:08,400","\"It wasn't that long.\""]
["00:08,400","00:09,400","\"But yeah.\""]
["00:09,400","00:13,400","\"Go use a telephone and you can level up now.\""]
["00:13,400","00:14,400","\"Okay.\""]
["00:14,400","00:18,600","\"Now we won't be getting stuck in no freaking fights.\""]
["00:18,600","00:19,600","\"As much.\""]
["00:19,600","00:20,600","\"As much.\""]
["00:20,600","00:23,800","\"I mean, you're still going to be doing lots of fights.\""]
["00:23,800","00:24,800","\"Don't worry.\""]
["00:24,800","00:27,400","\"Let's all talk about how our faces are screwed up.\""]
["00:27,400","00:30,120","\"I forgot about that.\""]
["00:30,120","00:32,280","\"It's the first thing he thinks.\""]
["00:32,280","00:34,880","\"Oh, no, we got to fight a thing.\""]
["00:34,880","00:36,520","\"Oh, yeah, you do.\""]
["00:36,520","00:37,760","\"You can do it.\""]
["00:37,760","00:40,120","\"Look at that.\""]
["00:40,120","00:41,120","\"Eight hundred points.\""]
["00:41,120","00:43,120","\"Yeah, we got a lot of levels.\""]
["00:43,120","00:44,480","\"Holy crap.\""]
["00:44,480","00:46,440","\"Well, we got to fight this.\""]
["00:46,440","00:47,440","\"So you do it.\""]
["00:47,440","00:49,480","\"Yeah, he's got the most significant upgrade to.\""]
["00:49,480","00:51,880","\"OK, can't get hit.\""]
["00:51,880","00:52,440","\"Can't get hit.\""]
["00:52,440","00:55,040","\"If you fail, do you lose out on that room entirely?\""]
["00:55,040","00:55,800","\"Yes.\""]
["00:55,800","01:04,920","\"or you lose I don't know I I don't know I have no idea I keep trying to look\""]
["01:04,920","01:09,320","\"into this game and I have no idea there's barely anything documented on it why\""]
["01:09,320","01:13,280","\"there's there's some information on it whoa it seems like a lot of stuff is\""]
["01:13,280","01:17,000","\"lost on people like how the stats work or no a lot of people are interested\""]
["01:17,000","01:22,120","\"enough if you got hired by Alex Yeeq in real life the the man we I really got\""]
["01:22,120","01:29,120","\"I like the game the way it is just fixed the fighting.\""]
["01:29,120","01:33,120","\"Well yeah, that's what I mean like mechanically.\""]
["01:33,120","01:36,120","\"What would you how would you design the system?\""]
["01:36,120","01:41,120","\"I think the fighting is like fun when it's not being repeated over and over and over.\""]
["01:41,120","01:46,120","\"It would be a lot around the interface and speeding things up and also not making animations\""]
["01:46,120","01:48,120","\"hold when you're trying to fast forward over them.\""]
["01:48,120","01:54,760","\"fast forward over them. Also have better information being conveyed. When you attack\""]
["01:54,760","02:00,240","\"and damage gets listed, you can barely even tell what you did. You don't know much about\""]
["02:00,240","02:03,280","\"the enemies either. You don't really know their stats. You don't really know what you're\""]
["02:03,280","02:07,080","\"affecting a lot of the time. I don't know. There's a lot that would have to be overhauled.\""]
["02:07,080","02:09,920","\"I think it'd take more than a discussion to do it. You probably have to make an entire\""]
["02:09,920","02:16,360","\"graphic. It's like a huge chart. Oh boy, I love infographics. How to redo it and make\""]
["02:16,360","02:17,360","\"the writing worse.\""]
["02:17,360","02:19,820","\"\"\"I must digest my information visually.\"\"\""]
["02:19,820","02:24,800","\"Because it is really weird how this game functions with its combat.\""]
["02:24,800","02:27,640","\"It seems very like half thought out.\""]
["02:27,640","02:33,040","\"Like they played some RPGs, but they don't seem to understand a lot about RPGs.\""]
["02:33,040","02:36,800","\"Even your party members, they seem very confused with the abilities he gave them.\""]
["02:36,800","02:41,000","\"\"\"Yeah, it's to me it's weird they don't seem to really reflect like what the character's\""]
["02:41,000","02:42,000","\"about.\"\"\""]
["02:42,000","02:44,040","\"And some skills are completely useless.\""]
["02:44,040","02:49,680","\"Yeah, they sure are. I can at least save this now because a lot of people were\""]
["02:49,680","02:53,800","\"complimenting LP toss in the original version of the game. They fixed it. Yeah,\""]
["02:53,800","03:00,000","\"it's not as good as it used to be. We're just too bad. Oh, hey, dad. You're dead.\""]
["03:00,000","03:04,600","\"Mm-hmm. Why is he here? Because he's a scarecrow, but see, the crow is not\""]
["03:04,600","03:13,200","\"scared. So the crow is trying to scare you with a scarecrow. Because that's your\""]
["03:13,200","03:15,200","\"father and he frightens you.\""]
["03:15,200","03:16,760","\"- Oh he doesn't.\""]
["03:16,760","03:18,480","\"Why does Daddy so mean?\""]
["03:18,480","03:19,920","\"- Don't forget, look.\""]
["03:19,920","03:24,160","\"Things might be tough, but yeah.\""]
["03:24,160","03:26,960","\"Um, crap, I'm terrible at this.\""]
["03:26,960","03:27,800","\"- Oh no.\""]
["03:27,800","03:29,200","\"So is this why you're shit?\""]
["03:29,200","03:30,700","\"Are we finally learning why you're shit?\""]
["03:30,700","03:34,240","\"- Sometimes adults realize that they made mistakes.\""]
["03:34,240","03:36,160","\"- This is Daddy's team's.\""]
["03:36,160","03:39,840","\"- The shorter their mistakes cost a lot of money.\""]
["03:39,840","03:42,720","\"- And require a lot of food.\""]
["03:42,720","03:44,720","\"and educations.\""]
["03:44,720","03:48,400","\"So you're a mistake and some adults like your mother?\""]
["03:48,400","03:50,720","\"I don't think Alex eat for some mistakes.\""]
["03:50,720","03:53,720","\"You wearing your dad's shirt?\""]
["03:53,720","03:59,720","\"He passes down his sword to you too.\""]
["03:59,720","04:04,720","\"You all have base thumping outside?\""]
["04:04,720","04:07,720","\"What is it?\""]
["04:07,720","04:08,720","\"I don't know.\""]
["04:10,720","04:13,840","\"\"\"One youthful dream with nice legs.\"\"\""]
["04:13,840","04:19,200","\"\"\"Only those legs aren't as smart as your mom's, but man.\"\"\""]
["04:19,200","04:20,720","\"*cough*\""]
["04:20,720","04:23,200","\"So your dad left your mom for another woman?\""]
["04:23,200","04:24,320","\"\"\"Bruh, leg.\"\"\""]
["04:24,320","04:25,320","\"\"\"Yeah.\"\"\""]
["04:25,320","04:27,320","\"\"\"Your actually brother is with Rory.\"\"\""]
["04:27,320","04:28,520","\"\"\"Ohhh.\"\"\""]
["04:28,520","04:30,120","\"\"\"You really shouldn't have tried to kiss him.\"\"\""]
["04:30,120","04:32,120","\"\"\"That's why you had such a strong bond.\"\"\""]
["04:32,120","04:35,120","\"\"\"Try not to make the same mistakes I made.\"\"\""]
["04:35,120","04:37,120","\"\"\"Okay.\"\"\""]
["04:37,120","04:38,920","\"*sigh*\""]
["04:38,920","04:41,320","\"I want to go kiss girls really badly.\""]
["04:41,320","04:45,960","\"Thinking about my dad kissing my friends is in a mistake.\""]
["04:45,960","04:47,440","\"What are you talking about dad?\""]
["04:47,440","04:48,520","\"Do I do three pee pee?\""]
["04:48,520","04:50,360","\"Three pee pee is pretty good.\""]
["04:50,360","04:51,160","\"Okay.\""]
["04:51,160","04:52,360","\"That's a lot of pee pee.\""]
["04:52,360","04:53,040","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:53,040","04:55,520","\"Alex is bursting with pee pee.\""]
["04:55,520","04:58,760","\"Look to sure is, dude.\""]
["04:58,760","05:01,640","\"Is it pretty good to be can't control this pee pee?\""]
["05:01,640","05:03,680","\"It's really really can't.\""]
["05:03,680","05:05,720","\"I don't like thinking about Alex peeing himself.\""]
["05:05,720","05:07,960","\"You can't know what's penis.\""]
["05:07,960","05:08,960","\"This penis.\""]
["05:08,960","05:09,960","\"Oh, you want stuff.\""]
["05:09,960","05:10,960","\"FUCCA!\""]
["05:10,960","05:11,960","\"That rocks.\""]
["05:11,960","05:13,720","\"We're going to be so fucking powerful.\""]
["05:13,720","05:14,720","\"You're so thing.\""]
["05:14,720","05:15,720","\"Did your friends level up to?\""]
["05:15,720","05:16,720","\"Oh wait, your friends don't get to.\""]
["05:16,720","05:18,560","\"You don't have friends.\""]
["05:18,560","05:19,560","\"Buckers.\""]
["05:19,560","05:21,960","\"Uh, should we be done with our friends here?\""]
["05:21,960","05:22,960","\"No.\""]
["05:22,960","05:23,960","\"Okay.\""]
["05:23,960","05:24,960","\"That would have been.\""]
["05:24,960","05:25,960","\"Yeah, because they don't level up with you.\""]
["05:25,960","05:26,960","\"They level up independently.\""]
["05:26,960","05:29,400","\"They get their own experience when they're fighting with you.\""]
["05:29,400","05:31,600","\"The game's really bad at conveying that by the way.\""]
["05:31,600","05:32,600","\"I only realized that.\""]
["05:32,600","05:33,880","\"It's conveying a lot of things.\""]
["05:33,880","05:37,680","\"I only realized that by opening the status menus and reading them.\""]
["05:37,680","05:40,120","\"Let's go find our friend, Bella.\""]
["05:40,120","05:41,120","\"- Bella.\""]
["05:41,120","05:42,280","\"- Bella, Bella, Bella.\""]
["05:42,280","05:45,880","\"- Alex doesn't even remember her name.\""]
["05:45,880","05:47,600","\"- A Bethany?\""]
["05:47,600","05:49,040","\"- Velma?\""]
["05:49,040","05:50,040","\"Velma!\""]
["05:50,040","05:52,880","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:52,880","05:54,200","\"- Yeah, that's it, Velma!\""]
["05:54,200","05:57,040","\"Like he's running off down the street.\""]
["05:57,040","05:58,320","\"- Oh.\""]
["05:58,320","06:00,560","\"- He runs past her at one point.\""]
["06:00,560","06:01,920","\"- You would never do that.\""]
["06:01,920","06:03,080","\"- He gives you a skateboard.\""]
["06:03,080","06:03,920","\"- He gives you a skateboard.\""]
["06:03,920","06:05,680","\"- Oh my God.\""]
["06:05,680","06:06,840","\"He's your skateboard.\""]
["06:06,840","06:08,840","\"What about my cat?\""]
["06:08,840","06:10,840","\"What are my hair?\""]
["06:10,840","06:12,840","\"What if we do this?\""]
["06:12,840","06:14,840","\"Ride your hair, Chris.\""]
["06:14,840","06:16,840","\"Well, have a fun ride.\""]
["06:16,840","06:19,840","\"You're now allowed to move to the wall.\""]
["06:19,840","06:21,840","\"I like that.\""]
["06:21,840","06:26,840","\"I kind of like it only because the areas have so many walls that it makes you try to think about it.\""]
["06:26,840","06:30,840","\"It's kind of like, um, uh,\""]
["06:30,840","06:32,840","\"I was going to say PSI.\""]
["06:32,840","06:33,840","\"I was gonna say PSI.\""]
["06:33,840","06:34,840","\"- WOW!\""]
["06:34,840","06:36,480","\"- They call it PK in English.\""]
["06:36,480","06:38,080","\"It's like a PK teleport.\""]
["06:38,080","06:40,480","\"- Sorry, a little carried away there babe.\""]
["06:40,480","06:43,320","\"- You have to make sure you have enough space.\""]
["06:43,320","06:46,600","\"- I love the fall, but sometimes I hate it.\""]
["06:46,600","06:47,500","\"Does that make sense?\""]
["06:47,500","06:48,960","\"- I kissed Rory.\""]
["06:48,960","06:49,800","\"Okay.\""]
["06:49,800","06:50,640","\"- Okay.\""]
["06:50,640","06:51,480","\"- I'm sorry.\""]
["06:51,480","06:53,920","\"(laughing)\""]
["06:53,920","06:56,080","\"- You can stop trying to squeeze it out of me.\""]
["06:56,080","06:59,040","\"- Probably because I get so sad to see it go.\""]
["06:59,040","07:00,720","\"- Aw, me too, Bella.\""]
["07:00,720","07:01,680","\"- I like Thanksgiving.\""]
["07:01,680","07:02,940","\"That's always fun.\""]
["07:02,940","07:04,720","\"- But, Vellie, you're in a different reality.\""]
["07:04,720","07:06,680","\"You get to have a standard Thanksgiving.\""]
["07:06,680","07:08,240","\"- But like Christmas?\""]
["07:08,240","07:09,440","\"That's always depressing.\""]
["07:09,440","07:12,880","\"This celebration always makes me feel uncomfortable.\""]
["07:12,880","07:16,320","\"Like, are you really happy?\""]
["07:16,320","07:18,880","\"Or are you just pretending because it's Christmas?\""]
["07:18,880","07:21,160","\"- Okay.\""]
["07:21,160","07:23,320","\"What are you getting me for Christmas?\""]
["07:23,320","07:24,840","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:24,840","07:26,200","\"I am the fall.\""]
["07:26,200","07:27,240","\"Look at me.\""]
["07:27,240","07:29,360","\"- It always meant seeing my friends again,\""]
["07:29,360","07:31,360","\"I guess starting school you sucks.\""]
["07:31,360","07:32,360","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:32,360","07:37,360","\"You know, I haven't even thought about school since like the last winter, spring, never was.\""]
["07:37,360","07:41,360","\"I don't miss tests when you've had shit, but I missed learning.\""]
["07:41,360","07:43,360","\"I was good at school.\""]
["07:43,360","07:45,360","\"P.S., can you stop scowling at me?\""]
["07:45,360","07:46,360","\"*snorts*\""]
["07:46,360","07:48,360","\"Aren't we friends now?\""]
["07:48,360","07:50,360","\"Haven't I proven myself?\""]
["07:50,360","07:52,360","\"I could have kissed you yesterday.\""]
["07:52,360","07:53,360","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:53,360","07:54,360","\"I saved a blow.\""]
["07:54,360","07:55,360","\"But I sure is not to.\""]
["07:55,360","07:57,360","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:57,360","08:00,320","\"I don't think I'm created anything that helps real life.\""]
["08:00,320","08:02,880","\"By the way, don't talk to Rory.\""]
["08:02,880","08:05,040","\"I didn't think he tells he was alive.\""]
["08:05,040","08:07,600","\"Listen, he doesn't want to fuck her anymore.\""]
["08:07,600","08:08,800","\"He wants to fuck the robot.\""]
["08:08,800","08:11,280","\"Not following the big ground of the reality.\""]
["08:11,280","08:15,440","\"What's that thing they say about dreams and poets?\""]
["08:15,440","08:18,080","\"They make me sleepy.\""]
["08:18,080","08:22,720","\"Something like that.\""]
["08:22,720","08:25,520","\"Wow, we're really starting to get to know each other.\""]
["08:25,520","08:26,880","\"Ask your serious question.\""]
["08:26,880","08:29,160","\"Uh oh, don't do anything stupid, Alex.\""]
["08:29,160","08:30,040","\"Oh, it's gonna happen.\""]
["08:30,040","08:31,020","\"Go for it, Gingerboy.\""]
["08:31,020","08:32,020","\"Gingerboy.\""]
["08:32,020","08:32,520","\"Whoa.\""]
["08:32,520","08:34,720","\"It's like the one you came out.\""]
["08:34,720","08:36,040","\"The sky was blue.\""]
["08:36,040","08:38,600","\"So were the people, even my girlfriend.\""]
["08:38,600","08:42,440","\"You know, I don't think anyone has asked me that since I've been here.\""]
["08:42,440","08:43,760","\"Wow.\""]
["08:43,760","08:44,680","\"How many people?\""]
["08:44,680","08:46,000","\"1999 relevant.\""]
["08:46,000","08:48,320","\"How many people know about that?\""]
["08:48,320","08:49,480","\"I feel 64.\""]
["08:49,480","08:51,000","\"No, 65.\""]
["08:51,000","08:52,880","\"I'm sorry I was paying attention to the plot.\""]
["08:52,880","08:53,320","\"Oh.\""]
["08:53,320","08:54,480","\"No, I'm sorry.\""]
