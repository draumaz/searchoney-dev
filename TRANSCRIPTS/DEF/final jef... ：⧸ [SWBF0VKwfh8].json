["12:59,880","13:01,040","\"No, there's a chicken instead.\""]
["13:01,040","13:03,560","\"Yeah, Toto really just gets a cameo at the beginning\""]
["13:03,560","13:05,840","\"and then it's a chicken kind of takes his role.\""]
["13:05,840","13:08,240","\"Is it fat and doroth again?\""]
["13:08,680","13:12,080","\"Yeah, but door these like actually like a little girl even\""]

["13:13,780","13:16,800","\"It's kind of like a red dragon situation where it's like sounds of the lambs\""]
["13:16,800","13:19,400","\"had a prequel called Red Dragon\""]
["13:19,400","13:21,980","\"Yeah, and even though even I guess that's a pretty great example\""]
["13:21,980","13:24,480","\"But basically the movie is based off a book\""]
["13:24,480","13:28,720","\"Which is the sequel to the original book which the movie was made\""]
["13:28,720","13:29,600","\"Does it make sense?\""]
["13:29,600","13:32,120","\"I think it's based off a few bucks at the end\""]
["13:32,120","13:37,800","\"It said like based off of awesome of Oz and another book wait is is Wizard of Oz like Lord of the Rings?\""]
["13:37,800","13:39,800","\"Yeah, it's a little tongue of books.\""]
["13:39,800","13:41,520","\"Dude, I look at the-- it's like 30 books.\""]
["13:41,520","13:42,920","\"Yeah, I had no idea.\""]
["13:42,920","13:44,600","\"Oh, no, it's really, really bizarre.\""]
["13:44,600","13:46,120","\"But Return to Oz is a great film.\""]
["13:46,120","13:46,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["13:46,620","13:47,920","\"And are the books anything like the movie?\""]

["13:48,800","13:50,000","\"Don't know.\""]

["13:51,960","13:52,880","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\""]
["13:52,880","13:54,760","\"Return to Oz is a very dark tone.\""]
["13:54,760","13:56,560","\"As a child, it was horrifying to me.\""]
["13:56,560","13:57,960","\"And it's paced very slowly.\""]
["13:57,960","14:00,520","\"So it takes like 30 minutes for the movie to actually start.\""]
["14:00,520","14:01,800","\"But it's kind of worth it.\""]
["14:01,800","14:04,240","\"[MUSIC PLAYING]\""]

["14:04,740","14:05,240","\"Good one.\""]
["14:05,240","14:06,720","\"I still thought the part at the beginning\""]

["14:08,360","14:11,040","\"Adam mental instance here is pretty spiky.\""]
["14:11,040","14:13,200","\"- Yeah, here's the beginning.\""]
["14:13,200","14:15,880","\"It starts off with her obsessing about Oz\""]
["14:15,880","14:17,960","\"for the first book or the first movie, whatever.\""]
["14:17,960","14:20,760","\"- And it's supposed to be 1899.\""]
["14:20,760","14:21,960","\"- Yeah, it's like the turn of the century.\""]
["14:21,960","14:24,000","\"- So you could guess what like psychological,\""]
["14:24,000","14:25,480","\"like medical science would be.\""]
["14:25,480","14:28,160","\"- Yeah, they would have lobotomized her or something.\""]
["14:28,160","14:29,000","\"- I mean, it's close.\""]
["14:29,000","14:32,440","\"Yeah, it's like an electroshock therapy situation.\""]
["14:32,440","14:34,880","\"And it gets up to them literally just like putting\""]
["14:34,880","14:39,880","\"the shock things on her ears and I guess I won't spoil the rest.\""]
["14:39,880","14:41,160","\"- Yeah.\""]
["14:41,160","14:43,760","\"And then the first magical Oz moment is like,\""]
["14:43,760","14:45,240","\"\"\"Wow, we're in the deadly, deadly desert.\""]
["14:45,240","14:47,160","\"\"\"If you touch the sand, you die and turn to sand.\"\"\""]

["14:49,520","14:50,520","\"- Yeah.\""]
["14:50,520","14:51,840","\"And she doesn't really really care.\""]
["14:51,840","14:54,000","\"She's just like nonchalantly jumping over it.\""]
["14:54,000","14:55,760","\"- It just jumps across the rocks.\""]
