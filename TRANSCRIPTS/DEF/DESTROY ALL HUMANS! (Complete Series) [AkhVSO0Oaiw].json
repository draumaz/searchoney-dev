["04:00,680","04:05,880","\"I'm actually glad they did do that it is weird. They didn't put a reverb on it at least how bad would the audio quality be for\""]
["04:05,880","04:08,160","\"- The PS2 game if you took all the...\""]
["04:08,160","04:10,220","\"- They compressed it a lot for the PS2.\""]

["04:11,840","04:13,520","\"- Doesn't send that back.\""]

["04:32,760","04:34,280","\"- Yeah, some companies just forget.\""]

["05:06,200","05:07,800","\"including the one we're currently in,\""]
["05:07,800","05:11,440","\"and this butthole porn that's legal in our current jurisdiction,\""]
["05:11,440","05:13,240","\"there's so much of it.\""]
["05:13,240","05:15,920","\"- Why? - It's fucked to find something\""]
["05:15,920","05:17,560","\"on someone else's computer.\""]

["05:22,440","05:24,480","\"we're already talking about butthole porn.\""]
["05:24,480","05:27,840","\"- Yeah, this game actually goes into that topic.\""]
["05:27,840","05:30,120","\"- It does, this guy, this guy is an investigative--\""]
["05:30,120","05:33,080","\"- This is really weird, I know this is a brand new game,\""]
["05:33,080","05:35,480","\"But this is exactly how I remember it visually.\""]
["05:35,480","05:36,320","\"- Yeah, me too.\""]
["05:36,320","05:37,820","\"That's probably because your kid brain\""]
["05:37,820","05:38,660","\"filled it every thing.\""]
["05:38,660","05:40,660","\"Yeah, this is exactly what I remember.\""]

["05:46,120","05:46,960","\"- He is.\""]
["05:46,960","05:50,080","\"- But on top of that, I could have sworn\""]
["05:50,080","05:53,440","\"like just the lower resolution and everything.\""]
["05:53,440","05:55,520","\"Like things didn't have to look this good\""]
["05:55,520","05:56,960","\"to look this good.\""]
["05:56,960","05:57,800","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["05:57,800","05:59,240","\"- Because of the old TVs.\""]
["05:59,240","06:00,480","\"- Right, yeah.\""]
["06:00,480","06:03,000","\"I feel like if you just scaled up the original game,\""]
["06:03,000","06:04,960","\"it would look really, really fucking terrible.\""]
["06:04,960","06:07,860","\"But if you scale down this and put it on an old TV,\""]
["06:07,860","06:09,740","\"it probably wouldn't look that much better.\""]
["06:09,740","06:12,360","\"I remember there was a really like brief two years\""]
["06:12,360","06:15,840","\"where remember when GTA 4 came out,\""]
["06:15,840","06:17,540","\"yeah, it played it on like my CRT.\""]
["06:17,540","06:18,600","\"And I was like, this looks real.\""]
["06:18,600","06:20,440","\"And then we got our first HDTV.\""]
["06:20,440","06:22,600","\"And I was like, I can't fucking wait to see how this looks.\""]
["06:22,600","06:23,840","\"It looked horrible.\""]
["06:23,840","06:26,600","\"I was like, wow, I hate HDTVs, these suck.\""]
["06:26,600","06:28,440","\"And I hated them for like two whole years.\""]
["06:28,440","06:32,040","\"I had exactly the same experience.\""]
["06:32,040","06:37,100","\"Also your parents are my parents. Is that a real brothers? Yeah age you're attached by the feet\""]
["06:37,100","06:41,380","\"We don't look the same your Puerto Rican or something. Yeah, well, we're different to me\""]
["06:41,380","06:46,240","\"We're really really long congenital twins. We're not the same dude. Okay. Keep telling\""]
["06:46,240","06:49,320","\"Look at this little fucking gray\""]
["06:49,320","06:53,120","\"Movement I love moving\""]
["06:53,120","06:58,520","\"Now that we've moved I feel like there's not much else to do you cover like 90% of the game\""]
["06:59,360","07:03,760","\"Just by moving so I played this game at e3\""]
["07:03,760","07:10,240","\"- and you didn't I I went to one of them and I hated it. It was like the worst thing I ever did\""]
["07:10,240","07:14,620","\"Yeah, I kind of I go one day. That's that's what I typically do. Mm-hmm\""]
["07:14,620","07:20,480","\"It's like Kavakon just go one day and see five thousand sweaty people coffee and spinach at each other and you leave\""]
["07:20,480","07:22,560","\"Yeah, you buy some cool stuff\""]
["07:22,560","07:25,400","\"We can read this cow's brain\""]
["07:25,400","07:27,920","\"But can you write it?\""]
["07:28,480","07:30,480","\"He's thinking move\""]
["07:30,480","07:36,940","\"Kissed it. Did you kiss the actual cow?\""]
["07:36,940","07:46,880","\"Earth creatures this planet is now part of the furan empire your benevolent masters welcome you that sounds\""]
["07:46,880","07:52,480","\"I'm not kidding dude. It would sound fine if they put reverb on it. Yeah\""]
["07:52,480","07:55,080","\"I think you could actually clean a lot of this up by by tricking it\""]
["07:55,880","08:00,100","\"You can also bury within the just like ambient noise I bet I\""]
["08:00,100","08:02,940","\"Think they also they could have like\""]
["08:02,940","08:06,380","\"Made this look old-timey and like\""]
["08:06,380","08:12,580","\"1960s like if they put like a little bit of a filter on it or something that shit looks delicious\""]
["08:12,580","08:14,580","\"So what were you saying?\""]
["08:14,580","08:16,580","\"God that actually fuck that was nice\""]
["08:16,580","08:23,940","\"Fucking hell fuck I wish that was my face behind that cow\""]
["08:24,660","08:32,980","\"There's got to be someone that had some sort of horrid sexual awakening from like Ace of Intera or something where it crawls out of the rhinos ass\""]
["08:32,980","08:42,580","\"Some 11 year old somewhere saw that would oh yeah, that's that's right\""]
["08:42,580","08:44,700","\"I I think it's literally there\""]
["08:44,700","08:50,540","\"There's like a day when you're on the cusp of puberty and when you flip over the first thing you see is what you're like\""]
["08:50,540","08:54,980","\"Sexually attracted to for the rest of your life. So if you if you happen to cross\""]
["08:54,980","09:02,180","\"Like something bad if you're walking down a path and see something horrible better hope that's that's why they suggest\""]
["09:02,180","09:08,060","\"Psychiatrists always suggest you lock your 12 year olds in a blank white room for five years\""]
["09:08,060","09:13,160","\"Yeah with with just tits and butts all over the wall. Yeah, so they're in the old\""]

["09:31,340","09:35,060","\"Whoa, I assume because this remake got made I\""]
["09:35,060","09:38,360","\"Assume they're thinking about doing more of this right?\""]
["09:38,360","09:46,320","\"Pro I mean there was a few games maybe yeah, there were I think three and the third one by the time the third one rolled around\""]
["09:46,320","09:50,600","\"No one even knew it came out the second one. I knew about what the third right idea. Yeah\""]
["09:50,600","09:55,020","\"I also I had a friend that they have told us through before but I every time I think what this game I think about\""]
["09:55,020","09:57,760","\"By a 11 year old friend who shoppled to this game\""]
["09:57,760","10:06,440","\"She talking about mr. Ed you're here mr. Ed the horse\""]
["10:06,440","10:09,480","\"It's just the talking horse\""]
["10:13,400","10:17,500","\"That does make it a lot more morbid if the horses like sentient\""]
["10:17,500","10:24,000","\"Cuz it's new what it was doing those old like 1960s shows are so fucking stupid\""]
["10:24,000","10:28,400","\"I don't like watch them watch them like I don't watch episodes on episodes\""]
["10:28,400","10:33,200","\"But every time I've seen some garbage fucking show or movie from the 1960s\""]
["10:33,200","10:41,120","\"That was just like some forgotten schlock or just some some piece of shit like dude the Adam West Batman movie is actually like\""]
["10:41,800","10:46,720","\"Brilliant it's so good because it's just so shockingly it's so absurdly dumb\""]
["10:46,720","10:50,980","\"Yeah, like mr. Ed the whole fucking premise is like it was a horse that was like\""]
["10:50,980","10:57,000","\"And they made like 40 seasons of it. It just went on for fucking ever\""]
["10:57,000","11:00,000","\"Yeah, dude that show guns smoke made like a thousand episodes\""]
["11:00,000","11:07,360","\"I think literally I over a thousand in like ten years or something. Oh dude lassi lassi the whole premise of lassi is there's a dog\""]
["11:07,360","11:10,200","\"That's it there's a dog in a box. I think a couple times\""]
["11:10,200","11:12,200","\"I can use my jet pack I\""]

["11:35,480","11:41,420","\"Really? Yeah, because in this game you can pick up fucking cars and people and shit and I played it first\""]
["11:41,420","11:44,200","\"It is that bad the case of the half life?\""]
["11:44,200","11:47,120","\"You can pick up like anything\""]
