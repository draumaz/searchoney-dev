["01:44,080","01:46,320","\"All seems all barked to me\""]
["01:46,320","01:48,320","\"It's the open\""]
["01:48,320","01:51,720","\"Finally dude. All right now let's stop\""]
["01:51,720","01:57,600","\"It's so full of monsters\""]
["01:57,600","02:07,740","\"You didn't get to enjoy this natural splendor for even a second. Oh, I mean I could have I just I just kind of wanted to shoot things\""]

["02:18,960","02:27,080","\"Thought I had regular grenades there. Oh whoa. Oh, yeah, those are like they're they're like a new thing\""]
["02:27,080","02:29,720","\"They're like EMP grenades. That's sick in\""]
["02:29,720","02:33,560","\"Campaign they like shot guys and like stun them too\""]
["02:33,560","02:41,200","\"What do they do in a multiplayer disabled vehicles and they still do some damage, but they uh\""]
["02:42,400","02:49,380","\"That was good. There's a lot of stuff actually that like in campaign functions really well and in multiplayer that kind of didn't seem to know what to do with\""]
["02:49,380","02:50,660","\"Mmm\""]
["02:50,660","02:57,240","\"Like there's this thing that like shoots fireballs and it's kind of cool in the campaign, but in the multiplayer. It sucks ass\""]
["02:57,240","03:01,920","\"I don't know personally. I kind of I kind of like halo linear, but\""]
["03:01,920","03:08,920","\"This is this is a fine direction for it like it plays a little bit better than like a far cry or something does\""]
["03:09,680","03:13,880","\"So it's I don't know it's just a little bit better by virtue of that\""]
["03:13,880","03:16,760","\"Always loved out control. Yeah\""]
["03:16,760","03:24,080","\"Hey, Lowe's always had pretty good controls. Do you get vehicles like destiny? You do. Yeah, it's it's not like I guess\""]
["03:24,080","03:26,080","\"Hey, Lowe's always had vehicles any yeah\""]
["03:26,080","03:32,680","\"It's not like something you like summing out of your hand like in destiny, but yeah, you do get you do get vehicles\""]
["03:32,680","03:38,120","\"It's a little weird though because like a lot of the vehicles in halo. You need a second person to operate\""]
["03:38,800","03:44,320","\"Or like you know like the the warthog you need you need to fucking uh, yeah\""]
["03:44,320","03:51,560","\"So it's I don't know like I I kind of fucking didn't use the vehicles a lot and campaign\""]
["03:51,560","03:53,840","\"I ended up just kind of sticking mostly to\""]
["03:53,840","03:59,760","\"Grappling around your own fusion. So it's a bummer that they decided not to include co-op\""]
["03:59,760","04:06,520","\"It wasn't that they decided to it so that it wasn't finished. Oh, so they're they're putting it in but\""]
["04:07,520","04:13,780","\"It was either delay the game or uh or not have co-op and they went with not have co-op\""]
["04:13,780","04:21,380","\"That's sad. Yeah, like this definitely would have been a lot more fun if you had like a second person to like\""]
["04:21,380","04:23,640","\"Inflate with\""]
["04:23,640","04:28,720","\"Because I feel like so much of like sandbox open-world gameplay is that like yo\""]
["04:28,720","04:31,680","\"Did you just fucking see that kind of factor and\""]
["04:31,680","04:36,120","\"Like if you're I mean it's fine if we're sitting on a couch or something, but I don't know\""]
["04:36,320","04:41,220","\"It's always better if you got like a second person to like ram into shit while you're shooting stuff\""]
["04:41,220","04:44,600","\"I don't know. Hey, look hey, there's always been awesome. Go up. Yeah\""]
["04:44,600","04:49,320","\"It's such a like part of the series that it's weird that it launched without it. I\""]
["04:49,320","04:57,440","\"Don't know. I'll probably replay this when co-op comes out. It's not part of the story like threes was where ones at the arbiter\""]
["04:57,440","05:01,000","\"Yeah, it's just gonna be probably another master chief again\""]
["05:01,000","05:06,000","\"I think it'd be cool if it was like your multiplayer guy kind of like they did with a reach\""]
["05:06,000","05:12,240","\"Ooh, they should just have it be a rogue grunt. That's just my my little light. It's just one\""]

["08:10,160","08:13,900","\"What are the odds of all the trees growing and looking exactly the same as earth trees though\""]
["08:13,900","08:19,640","\"I mean they are probably planted with that intention. I think your controller just died. I am I'm walking into\""]

["09:23,220","09:29,280","\"aimed the camera and they drive that way yeah I like it it's neat I don't I\""]
["09:29,280","09:36,280","\"I don't know that there would be any other kind of game that I would want to control like that, but it definitely has like a distinct flavor to it.\""]
["09:36,280","09:42,280","\"It's perfect for a game, but like, you know, it all revolves around shooting and...\""]
["09:42,280","09:44,280","\"Yeah, yeah. Shit.\""]
["09:44,280","09:51,280","\"I feel like it works good for like a first-person shooter vehicle control scheme, but for like a GTA it would feel fucking weird.\""]
["09:51,280","09:52,280","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:52,280","09:54,280","\"I'd get sick.\""]
["09:54,280","09:55,280","\"Oh, I'd fry up on a few laps.\""]
["09:55,280","09:58,280","\"Also, it helps that every vehicle doesn't really exist in real life.\""]
["09:58,280","10:03,680","\"That's true. We want to upgrade the grapple shot as fast as possible\""]
["10:03,680","10:10,240","\"So now it's got lightning on it and we'll shock guys if I grab them. Yeah, wow\""]
["10:10,240","10:14,480","\"You knock down trees like a minecraft now I wish\""]
["10:14,480","10:21,600","\"There's not much in the realms of like destructible environments. You should build a little house by the river here\""]
["10:21,600","10:23,220","\"This is gorgeous\""]
["10:23,220","10:27,200","\"Yeah, it looks pretty good. I think people were like bitching about the graphics for some reason\""]
["10:27,200","10:29,560","\"But I was because there was a picture of a brute. It looked really\""]
["10:29,560","10:35,700","\"Yeah, so once you kill all these guys you get to use this one is that does that\""]
["10:35,700","10:40,920","\"What's a fob forward operating base?\""]
["10:40,920","10:44,920","\"I thought it was like a friend of meeting benefits\""]
["10:44,920","10:48,260","\"a friend of amazing benefits\""]
["10:48,260","10:51,900","\"So so just a normal friend\""]
["10:51,900","10:55,900","\"But like explicitly non beneficial.\""]
["10:55,900","10:59,900","\"Like there's a contractual element to it.\""]
["10:59,900","11:01,900","\"Yeah, if you fuck that friend, it actually detonates.\""]
["11:01,900","11:03,900","\"It's a fuck guy.\""]
["11:03,900","11:05,900","\"They got a fuck mind in their belly.\""]

["11:15,900","11:19,900","\"Yeah. This game now implies that she will become evil.\""]
["11:19,900","11:21,900","\"Yes\""]
["11:21,900","11:24,300","\"Branding I\""]
["11:24,300","11:26,500","\"Would agree with that\""]
["11:26,500","11:31,420","\"Our our cool AI is gonna get corrupted and turn against us\""]
["11:31,420","11:39,020","\"She's gonna it's a Spartan core a Spartan core is like an upgrade point that I can use\""]

["11:44,980","11:47,900","\"Just going to these get you like is this how you get upgrade points?\""]
["11:47,900","11:51,500","\"Yeah, it's the easiest thing. They're kind of around the map.\""]
["11:51,500","11:56,700","\"Tomar for every Spartan to be truly amazing in battle. He has to focus on one happy thought.\""]
["11:56,700","12:02,300","\"And what's what's Master Chief's happy thought going to the beach with his mummy?\""]
["12:02,300","12:07,580","\"Well, look at that cool thing. Oh, yeah. This is this is the skewer. It's basically like a long\""]
["12:07,580","12:13,100","\"range heavy sniper, but it's got a full way in it. It looks like it shoots a big spike.\""]
["12:13,100","12:17,180","\"I wouldn't say like the game is glitchy. Like you don't fall through the floor, but I've had like\""]
["12:17,180","12:20,940","\"like a lot of weird things like coming in and out of menus or like shit not loading\""]

["14:27,600","14:32,680","\"I think it's just an easy an easy way to do the construction when you're building a giant fucking halo\""]
["14:36,520","14:41,240","\"Should just throw rocks into it. Oh my build the big halo in space what this happened to it?\""]
["14:41,240","14:49,560","\"Yeah, you got a rocket. Yeah, you could have killed you with that moron. Oh, you do you dare dive in this economy?\""]

["15:31,720","15:37,060","\"Just gonna keep going forever but in the universe of halo war is fun as long as you're like one of the really cool guys\""]
["15:37,060","15:39,780","\"It kills everybody and not one of the guys. It just gets killed all the time\""]
["15:39,780","15:45,720","\"Yeah, you're right. Yeah as long as you're super op. It's pretty fun. Wait. What does your new thing do?\""]

["17:54,560","17:59,740","\"I just compared the fact that it doesn't pause in the menu. No, you said it was exactly the same\""]
["17:59,740","18:04,160","\"I did not wait. It looks like the cars can't even flip over you see that\""]
["18:04,160","18:09,880","\"I'm just fucking I I just fought against the physics there. I could know what you're a fucking thing\""]
["18:09,880","18:14,320","\"You had a branch and you should have spun around, but it corrected itself\""]

["18:23,660","18:24,660","\"That'd be cool.\""]
["18:24,660","18:25,660","\"They did flip it.\""]

["18:27,660","18:28,900","\"Yeah, prove it.\""]
["18:28,900","18:29,900","\"I will.\""]
["18:29,900","18:32,780","\"You're actually actively having trouble flipping it.\""]
["18:32,780","18:34,740","\"You might be right.\""]
["18:34,740","18:37,380","\"I'm telling you dude.\""]
["18:37,380","18:39,100","\"I can totally flip this.\""]

["18:53,980","18:56,260","\"It's a point\""]
["18:56,260","19:04,740","\"Movies that from a girl like Hercules or something and he basically\""]
["19:04,740","19:07,300","\"He just read the screen direction\""]
["19:07,300","19:13,660","\"Maybe I can't flip this car. This is causing me a fucking existential crisis. Go up that hill and try your very best\""]
["19:13,660","19:16,900","\"All right, it like corrects itself in the air\""]
["19:17,580","19:22,640","\"All right here. I can maybe get some like rampage off that there we go if that doesn't flip\""]
["19:22,640","19:26,620","\"It's impossible to flip these cars\""]
["19:26,620","19:31,940","\"Well, you see the reaches far too strong look at that see see\""]

["19:56,180","20:00,780","\"Definitely in the multiplayer they still flip over yeah\""]
["20:00,780","20:06,800","\"It might genuinely be impossible to flip this car\""]
["20:06,800","20:13,120","\"I don't think it's impossible, but I think like it really really compensate. Yeah, like trying to find something that I can\""]
["20:13,120","20:15,540","\"There we go\""]
