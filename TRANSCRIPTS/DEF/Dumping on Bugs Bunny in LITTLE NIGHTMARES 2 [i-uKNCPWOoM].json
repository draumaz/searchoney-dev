["08:26,780","08:31,180","\"And it's got like a ton of the same plot points. You're gonna kill me. I've never seen inception\""]
["08:31,180","08:36,740","\"It's not great, but I know but I know it's that big. It's a big staple in\""]
["08:37,180","08:44,020","\"Sit up a history that movie annoys the shit out of me because the whole first like hour and a half of that movie is\""]
["08:44,020","08:47,620","\"Explaining the rules of dreams and then break them all break\""]
["08:47,620","08:51,300","\"Those guys though, right? Yeah\""]

["09:05,260","09:09,020","\"Westworld season 2 is not very good at Westworld season 3. I watched two episodes up\""]
["09:09,020","09:14,380","\"And I was like this is fucking confusing and all their movies are confusing to make you feel stupid\""]
["09:14,380","09:17,700","\"But it's ne- but if you think about it, they're the stupid ones\""]
["09:17,700","09:33,220","\"I'm always watching movies and halfway through the movie\""]
["09:33,220","09:35,820","\"I'm like I think I might be because I don't know what's happening\""]
["09:35,820","09:38,080","\"I can like juggle a bunch of characters in storyboard\""]
["09:38,080","09:42,440","\"It's like when a movie is like intentionally confusing to make you go to make you go whoa man\""]
["09:42,440","09:46,220","\"Christopher Nolan's real bad for that. There's a there's a scene in\""]
["09:46,220","09:53,380","\"Interstellar where it's like a 15 minute scene and they're like on computers and doing stuff\""]
["09:53,380","09:57,060","\"And they don't explain what the fuck they're doing so the whole time you're like man\""]
["09:57,060","10:02,100","\"What the fuck are they doing interstellar is the best movie but by by Christopher Loa that I can think of\""]
["10:02,100","10:06,660","\"But that's a normal that's a normal that's not a very good. That's another one. It's kind of deliberately confusing\""]
["10:06,660","10:10,620","\"You like your left confused so that you're supposed to go like whoa, dude\""]
["10:10,620","10:16,060","\"It was fucking backwards man pull yet play that movie a normal at normal rate\""]
["10:16,060","10:21,320","\"I think the DVD or something has like a version of it. That's it in order and yeah, it's not a very\""]
["10:21,320","10:25,660","\"Watch that watch the confusing the normal one first of it. I watch that one. I was like well\""]
["10:25,660","10:28,140","\"That was like it. Oh you watch the normal one first\""]
["10:28,140","10:33,600","\"No, I mean normalize in the way the way it came out and then I watched the re-edited one where it plays in normal mode\""]
["10:33,600","10:36,160","\"So I was not to feed the entire point of the movie\""]
["10:36,160","10:39,800","\"Yeah, but I saw no what I'm saying is I watched the out of order like the way it was released\""]
["10:39,800","10:42,400","\"I just don't understand why they go back and do that just leave it alone\""]
["10:42,400","10:45,440","\"I don't know but I was like I was curious. I was like what but wow\""]
["10:45,440","10:51,120","\"You know when you're saying you're like it doesn't make any sense when they're like I know what you're talking about like\""]
["10:51,120","10:56,600","\"That that one scene I know exactly we're talking about but do you ever watch movies like that where that happens and you're like\""]
["10:57,000","11:00,280","\"Maybe this is just really smart and I don't get it. I think yeah\""]
["11:00,280","11:06,280","\"But but then like I don't know has there ever been a point where someone will like\""]
["11:06,280","11:14,760","\"Essentially debunk that and be like I mean like a big part of filmmaking is making sure that the stuff that you do reads\""]
["11:14,760","11:20,800","\"Right like just just the fact that like if someone's watching it it translates like what's on screen\""]
["11:20,800","11:25,000","\"But dude doesn't like oh, yeah, and you're just trying to make sure everyone comprehends your art, dude\""]
["11:25,000","11:30,520","\"I think you could also do with like video because a lot of the problem with the movies do that is it's usually script\""]
["11:30,520","11:34,200","\"Like usually they'll say what's they'll say we have to go to the thing and do the thing\""]
["11:34,200","11:39,800","\"But if you're not seeing what's on screen, it's easy to forget stuff because movies move so quickly. Yeah, like I don't know\""]
["11:39,800","11:46,440","\"My favorite movies like you never watch back to the future get confused by it. It's a fucking crazy. Yeah a guy goes back in time in a car\""]
["11:46,440","11:47,940","\"Oh\""]
["11:47,940","11:53,480","\"That's insane, but you know what's going on the whole time that would be cool if they stop for ten minutes to explain the science of the flux\""]
["11:53,560","11:58,620","\"Capacitor and why it makes so much sense they Kevin Smith come on screen and explain it to you just like it's cool movies\""]
["11:58,620","12:04,860","\"Yeah, I'd like to see a fucking like 15 minute scene where they're like building the flux capacitor before they tell you what it is\""]
["12:04,860","12:09,600","\"I love to see a 15 minute scene of a movie where Kevin Smith is crying and a fish eye lens\""]
["12:09,600","12:13,960","\"Looking directly to the camera weeping I want faces right as a tomato\""]
["12:13,960","12:16,680","\"Was that a thing?\""]
["12:16,680","12:20,760","\"posted like one million pictures of stuff crying in a weird like close up\""]
["12:20,760","12:27,260","\"There's like there's like there's like more than five of those for sure that are all different. What's the what's the he's just trying to show\""]
["12:27,260","12:33,140","\"How emotionally gets when he watches like he's like I just watched like I don't know Thor - and I\""]

["12:47,680","12:49,680","\"He should get a huge clip\""]
["12:49,680","12:51,680","\"Grafted onto his body\""]
["12:51,680","12:52,680","\"He should get a big pussy\""]
["12:52,680","12:54,680","\"Put on his chest so I can fuck it\""]
["12:54,680","12:55,680","\"While he cries\""]

["16:37,340","16:44,360","\"Yeah, I'm actually invested now. Yeah, any good video game as long as I can play it for a hundred hours\""]
["16:44,360","16:48,260","\"And then get like a small aesthetic difference to my characters. If I don't have hats\""]
["16:48,260","16:54,780","\"I will take the game out of the machine. I will break it with a hammer and hold her some some masks like that guy who did the\""]
["16:54,780","16:59,500","\"Did a shikki video I don't want to rag on it or nothing what it is it is actually kind of genius\""]
["16:59,500","17:04,260","\"To just like it like when you're making these little characters in your 3d program\""]
["17:04,260","17:06,860","\"Whatever their heads are parented to their head bone or whatever\""]
["17:06,860","17:10,500","\"So you can just have a 3d model and parented to their fucking head bone\""]

["17:40,620","17:46,220","\"I don't think I have to be pulling it that way. I just had to get it out of the way. That was overkill. Yeah, I know\""]
