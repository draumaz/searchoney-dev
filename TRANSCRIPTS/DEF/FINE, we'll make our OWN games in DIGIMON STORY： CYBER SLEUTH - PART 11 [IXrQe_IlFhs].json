["00:16,000","00:18,000","\"I'd have to remember.\""]
["00:18,000","00:20,000","\"I mean, like a smash TV clone.\""]
["00:20,000","00:22,000","\"Go down to memorize.\""]

["00:28,000","00:30,000","\"- Fucking stagecast, yeah. - Yeah, stagecast.\""]
["00:30,000","00:31,640","\"- This didn't go anywhere.\""]
["00:31,640","00:33,520","\"I would constantly get,\""]
["00:33,520","00:35,920","\"I'm frustrated that I couldn't do more.\""]
["00:35,920","00:37,280","\"- It was so bad.\""]
["00:37,280","00:38,760","\"- Stagecast. - It's not a good\""]
["00:38,760","00:39,680","\"game making thing.\""]

["00:41,040","00:42,600","\"- No, what the frick is that?\""]
["00:42,600","00:45,160","\"- How would you describe it, Julian?\""]
["00:45,160","00:49,680","\"- It is a beginner's in five year old children\""]
["00:49,680","00:53,840","\"level like game making software.\""]
["00:53,840","00:54,680","\"- Wow, really?\""]
["00:55,840","00:59,760","\"you can program in like actions to happen,\""]
["00:59,760","01:03,840","\"but only in really, really specific circumstances.\""]
["01:03,840","01:07,560","\"And like each action can, like only one thing\""]
["01:07,560","01:08,880","\"can happen at a time.\""]
["01:08,880","01:09,840","\"I remember having these cool.\""]
["01:09,840","01:11,360","\"Yeah, you get to see your friend, Chris.\""]
["01:11,360","01:12,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:12,840","01:14,440","\"Only one thing can happen at a time\""]
["01:14,440","01:17,160","\"and it takes like a minimum of a second between each thing.\""]
["01:17,160","01:18,000","\"Wow.\""]
["01:18,000","01:20,520","\"It's a, it was not good if you're--\""]
["01:20,520","01:21,520","\"Take it like beyond--\""]
["01:21,520","01:23,040","\"Trim is built in movement.\""]
["01:23,040","01:24,240","\"Have you remember what it's called?\""]
["01:24,240","01:25,360","\"It's a great system.\""]
["01:25,360","01:27,700","\"I do. God, Space Station 13.\""]
["01:27,700","01:30,200","\"- You never played Scary game?\""]
["01:30,200","01:32,000","\"- No, I never played that one.\""]
["01:32,000","01:33,000","\"- Do you know what it is?\""]
["01:33,000","01:33,840","\"- No.\""]
["01:33,840","01:36,680","\"- It's spelled with an E, scary E game.\""]
["01:36,680","01:38,200","\"- It sounds scary.\""]
["01:38,200","01:39,600","\"- You're all in a mansion.\""]
["01:39,600","01:42,440","\"Tell me if you've heard of this concept before.\""]
["01:42,440","01:46,600","\"Some people are randomly chosen to be a traitor\""]
["01:46,600","01:48,520","\"and you're supposed to try to kill everybody else\""]
["01:48,520","01:49,880","\"without them figuring you out.\""]
["01:49,880","01:51,440","\"- It's kind of like Space Station 13.\""]
["01:51,440","01:53,000","\"- But this was from like 2001.\""]
["01:53,000","01:54,720","\"Like this is way, way better.\""]
["01:54,720","01:58,240","\"Maybe 2002 is around the same time as Space Station 13.\""]
["01:58,240","01:59,740","\"And it's actually a pretty fun beyond game.\""]
["01:59,740","02:03,280","\"It's actually a good time with a big group.\""]
["02:03,280","02:05,260","\"They have like booby traps all over this mansion\""]
["02:05,260","02:06,160","\"that you can run around in.\""]
["02:06,160","02:07,360","\"You have tools you can use\""]
["02:07,360","02:08,760","\"so you can put like glue on the floor\""]
["02:08,760","02:10,920","\"to get somebody stuck in place.\""]
["02:10,920","02:13,000","\"It's actually really fun.\""]
["02:13,000","02:15,000","\"There are some fun games on beyond\""]
["02:15,000","02:16,600","\"like if you go back and dig around,\""]
["02:16,600","02:18,800","\"but it's pretty limited.\""]
["02:18,800","02:23,200","\"Space Station 13 is probably the shining example.\""]
["02:23,200","02:26,740","\"I think space station 13 actually genuinely ruined games for me.\""]
["02:26,740","02:28,540","\"Really? Dude too much.\""]
["02:28,540","02:30,420","\"You can do so much and have so much fun in it.\""]
["02:30,420","02:31,420","\"It's crazy, isn't it?\""]
["02:31,420","02:33,980","\"It's the funnest fucking game on planet earth.\""]
["02:33,980","02:37,060","\"Like it blew everybody's minds when it came out just because\""]
["02:37,060","02:41,800","\"how much you could do, how open it was, how creative you could get thanks to that.\""]
["02:41,800","02:45,060","\"You can do the most elaborate shit to people in that if you just want to.\""]
["02:45,060","02:48,500","\"You can have insane crazy stories every single round.\""]
["02:48,500","02:49,220","\"It's amazing.\""]
["02:49,220","02:51,220","\"It's never going to be the same experience.\""]
["02:51,300","02:53,660","\"Yeah, like, uh, it's just perfect.\""]
["02:53,660","02:59,020","\"But like, I think it also proved that I definitely have like 80 or something.\""]
["02:59,020","03:03,500","\"I can only play a game after a fucking assload of shit you can do in it.\""]
["03:03,500","03:05,220","\"Because you want to get creative.\""]
["03:05,220","03:05,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:05,620","03:06,060","\"Yeah.\""]
["03:06,060","03:08,020","\"And by that, I mean, you want to fuck around.\""]
["03:08,020","03:09,100","\"Exactly.\""]
["03:09,100","03:10,380","\"I love trolling people in it.\""]
["03:10,380","03:14,460","\"It's a really big thing about shrinking the guy gradually.\""]
["03:14,460","03:17,540","\"OK, I used to do this thing in space.\""]
["03:17,540","03:21,140","\"They should 13 or you can only do this if you're an admin, but it doesn't\""]
["03:21,140","03:24,660","\"really actually affect the edit function. Yeah, you're so if\""]
["03:24,660","03:26,740","\"you're an admin, you can right click on other people playing\""]
["03:26,740","03:29,580","\"and you can just fuck with them like you can literally in space\""]
["03:29,580","03:32,320","\"station 13, you can add every variable, you can right click\""]
["03:32,320","03:35,060","\"on someone say, give disease like Spanish flu and then they'll\""]
["03:35,060","03:37,260","\"just start like coughing and like they'll just die halfway\""]
["03:37,260","03:39,820","\"through like obviously you shouldn't do that and I don't do\""]
["03:39,820","03:42,300","\"that. But my favorite thing to do is you'd right click on\""]
["03:42,300","03:45,380","\"someone as they're running around having fun, you'd go to\""]
["03:45,380","03:49,260","\"variables resize and then I type in 0.9 so they shrink a tiny\""]
["03:49,260","03:53,580","\"bit and they'd be like, \"\"What the fuck?\"\" and then they keep walking around and you just\""]
["03:53,580","03:58,340","\"keep slightly shrinking them so they don't notice. Till there's a point where like, \"\"Wait a minute,\""]
["03:58,340","04:02,700","\"why am I so small? What's going on?\"\" It's like the funniest shit ever.\""]
["04:02,700","04:06,060","\"I mean, I remember that like, that's what you wanted to do in Minecraft when you were\""]
["04:06,060","04:10,020","\"playing you, you liked the idea of floating around and being a trickster god.\""]
["04:10,020","04:11,540","\"I like being a ghost.\""]
["04:11,540","04:13,740","\"Striking people with lightning continuously.\""]
["04:13,740","04:17,660","\"And then probably seeing them that you won't and then do it anyway.\""]
["04:17,660","04:18,660","\"Exactly.\""]
["04:18,660","04:23,140","\"Look yeah, I'm okay. I'm a piece of shit. Hey, I get it. It's entertaining. It's fun\""]
["04:23,140","04:28,660","\"It's just video games doesn't matter. I would never do to someone who that had something to lose. What was I talking about?\""]
["04:28,660","04:33,120","\"Video games space station 13. Yeah, rune games for me sort of Dark Souls\""]
["04:33,120","04:35,460","\"one\""]
["04:35,460","04:39,560","\"But then what rekindled your interest in video games again?\""]
["04:39,560","04:42,900","\"Literally I nothing oh\""]
["04:44,100","04:45,100","\"That's a problem.\""]
["04:45,100","04:46,100","\"Yeah, it makes sense.\""]
["04:46,100","04:48,540","\"I like playing all of the old games I enjoy.\""]
["04:48,540","04:53,660","\"Like games that still like still haven't mastered and there's a high skill ceiling and you\""]
["04:53,660","04:55,940","\"still go back and try to improve blah blah blah blah.\""]
["04:55,940","04:56,940","\"Oh, like panic.\""]
["04:56,940","04:57,940","\"Oh fuck.\""]
["04:57,940","04:58,940","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:58,940","05:02,740","\"The game requires a lot of skill.\""]
["05:02,740","05:04,140","\"I like racing games.\""]
["05:04,140","05:05,740","\"I like drift or not drift.\""]
["05:05,740","05:07,460","\"I like distance.\""]
["05:07,460","05:08,660","\"Racing games are a lot of fun.\""]
["05:08,660","05:09,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:09,660","05:14,860","\"People are making some cool attempts at like, uh, recreating old arcade racers and their aesthetic.\""]
["05:14,860","05:19,500","\"I'm trying to think of new games that came out recently that I enjoyed, because I know there is a few.\""]
["05:19,500","05:20,960","\"Hitman, Hitman 3.\""]
["05:20,960","05:23,660","\"That's a game that like, you can be creative as hell.\""]
["05:23,660","05:25,860","\"You do whatever the hell you want and it's fun.\""]
["05:25,860","05:28,260","\"Do you still hit...man?\""]
["05:28,260","05:28,860","\"No.\""]
["05:28,860","05:31,060","\"I freaking love Hitman.\""]
["05:31,060","05:32,960","\"What kind of stuff can you do?\""]
["05:32,960","05:35,860","\"Can you tie people's legs together and then swing them around?\""]
["05:35,860","05:37,460","\"No, I wish you could do that.\""]
["05:37,460","05:39,560","\"You can throw screwdrivers in the people's faces.\""]
["05:39,560","05:41,560","\"Did they get stuck?\""]
["05:41,560","05:42,560","\"Yeah, they died.\""]
["05:42,560","05:44,560","\"That's really funny.\""]
["05:44,560","05:49,560","\"You can literally pick up a soda can and throw it into someone's face over and over and over while they're lying on the ground.\""]
["05:49,560","05:51,560","\"You know what I can compliment right now?\""]
["05:51,560","05:52,560","\"Worms are McGeddon.\""]
["05:52,560","05:53,560","\"I love worms.\""]
["05:53,560","05:58,560","\"Because worms are McGeddon specifically with how open it is and everything being just...\""]
["05:58,560","06:02,560","\"You can make your own assets, you can do whatever the fuck you want to that game, just customize the shit out of it.\""]
["06:02,560","06:04,560","\"Worms will never get old, ever.\""]
["06:04,560","06:10,240","\"All the weapons are so many of them and so many of them are just creative that you can just go nuts with that game and always have a really good time\""]
["06:10,240","06:14,240","\"Mm-hmm. It feels like it's just infinite content. It's also\""]
["06:14,240","06:18,880","\"Really interesting how you can make a level for you know, you know how in games\""]
["06:18,880","06:21,920","\"I'll give you a level maker. Yeah, even though you make a level\""]
["06:21,920","06:24,480","\"It still won't be that good because you're not a fucking game designer\""]
["06:24,480","06:28,320","\"Yeah, it warms in worms are again no matter what you draw it will make no\""]
["06:28,320","06:32,160","\"It's completely true and you can kind of figure it out right away that you're like, okay, wait\""]
["06:32,160","06:36,440","\"I already understand this right here. This guy's armpit. That's where you're gonna probably spawn in. Yeah\""]
["06:36,440","06:41,480","\"It's things like that like it's so easy to work with. Yeah, I remember when I was a kid in high school\""]
["06:41,480","06:45,260","\"That's what we did. We had a land party everybody was playing Dota just getting pissed off\""]
["06:45,260","06:48,140","\"I brought worms armageddon and we switched over to that at the end of the night\""]
["06:48,140","06:55,120","\"And everyone was just making their own maps and sharing them because it's just so easy to do the worms armageddon's like one of the best games ever\""]
["06:55,120","07:00,520","\"They still updated. It's crazy. Yeah, I saw it. I did put out a huge update last year. They added\""]
["07:01,620","07:07,740","\"Repilation yeah, that was really crazy. I didn't think they would do something like that like they even made a neat little advertisement for it\""]
["07:07,740","07:14,500","\"Team 17. Thank you so much. Yeah, it was my favorite game growing up and you guys are still supporting it. Yeah, we love\""]

["07:42,820","07:44,060","\"eh, he falls over.\""]
["07:44,060","07:47,180","\"- Oh, I haven't seen that one in a long time.\""]
["07:47,180","07:48,500","\"- That's 'cause it was the later season.\""]
["07:48,500","07:49,340","\"- Yeah, exactly.\""]
["07:49,340","07:50,180","\"- Yeah, okay.\""]

["07:53,660","07:55,640","\"- It was really sad, I remember when I was a kid,\""]
["07:55,640","07:57,380","\"'cause I loved the Simpsons growing up.\""]
["07:57,380","08:00,280","\"And I remember when those episodes were starting to air, the ones like,\""]
["08:00,280","08:01,940","\"Bart being in a boy band.\""]
["08:01,940","08:04,180","\"Yeah, I remember being 12 and being like, \"\"This sucks.\"\"\""]
["08:04,180","08:06,180","\"That was when I stopped watching.\""]
["08:06,180","08:08,380","\"I caught a few episodes later on,\""]
["08:08,380","08:12,180","\"but nothing ever made me really want to watch it again.\""]
["08:12,180","08:14,580","\"That's why I'd be curious about, like,\""]
["08:14,580","08:16,380","\"like I said previously,\""]
["08:16,380","08:19,380","\"there are people who say the new seasons are getting better.\""]

["09:08,360","09:14,060","\"Specifically we had a friend who was telling us that they felt like fall guys was really gonna be the big thing for a long time\""]

["10:31,880","10:35,880","\"That's not real no really\""]
["10:35,880","10:40,840","\"Yeah, maybe laugh\""]
["10:40,840","10:46,880","\"Like I couldn't get into among us because space station 13 it is space station 13. Yeah, it's very reduced simple\""]
["10:46,880","10:48,880","\"It's like but they're a lot of games\""]
["10:50,240","10:53,480","\"No, no, but here's the thing I think it's genius right cuz nobody\""]
["10:53,480","10:59,000","\"Nobody can get into space station 13 you have to literally train somebody to get into it\""]
["10:59,000","11:01,280","\"Yeah, so they'd like nobody wants to learn it\""]
["11:01,280","11:05,120","\"But among us is like point one percent of the space station 13's mechanics\""]
["11:05,120","11:06,960","\"So like anyone can jump in and play it\""]
["11:06,960","11:10,440","\"But I mean that's the appeal too is that it's so simple as a game\""]
["11:10,440","11:13,560","\"You could port it to other devices it could be on your phone a bunch of yeah\""]
["11:13,560","11:17,200","\"I think it's genius, but I just can't get into it\""]
["11:17,440","11:24,840","\"Also, I hate the busy work minigames that they have it. It tears friends apart from what I've seen which is really baffling to me\""]
["11:24,840","11:30,840","\"Yeah, because I would hope that people are thinking of it as a game and not like super getting into it\""]
["11:30,840","11:36,240","\"Because I've seen people do that really like I wanted among us. It's like what it's not an e-sport\""]

["12:07,040","12:08,480","\"- No! - They're not Among Us.\""]
["12:08,480","12:11,760","\"- No, I hated how insanely popular it became\""]

["12:14,640","12:16,600","\"It's all anybody wanted to play.\""]
["12:16,600","12:21,120","\"And two was that it always devolves into the same shit\""]
["12:21,120","12:23,600","\"every single round and it gets old really fast.\""]
["12:23,600","12:26,080","\"- I will say it does seem like there's only a few\""]
["12:26,080","12:27,680","\"different things you can really do.\""]
["12:27,680","12:29,240","\"I've always seen people play it out\""]

["12:30,800","12:32,280","\"- But I still think it's genius.\""]
["12:32,280","12:33,120","\"- Over and over and over again\""]

["12:37,200","12:40,000","\"taking it way too seriously is really bizarre to me\""]
