["00:14,800","00:15,400","\"*Dramatic Music*\""]
["00:15,400","00:18,480","\"Why don't you just say everything about this game is good?\""]
["00:18,480","00:20,400","\"Ow my fucking face!\""]
["00:20,400","00:23,480","\"Well you slammed directly into more health, so...\""]
["00:23,480","00:25,080","\"You know. No I don't. No foul.\""]
["00:25,080","00:26,400","\"You win some, you lose some.\""]
["00:26,400","00:30,620","\"If you found a video game extra life in real life,\""]
["00:30,620","00:35,940","\"and a video game one that worked the same way, but in real life.\""]
["00:35,940","00:37,220","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["00:37,220","00:39,700","\"So let's say you find a little green mushroom,\""]
["00:39,700","00:42,180","\"it gives you an extra existence,\""]
["00:42,180","00:44,380","\"but it doesn't make you age slower or anything.\""]
["00:44,380","00:49,060","\"Would you ever just give it a try, see what death is like?\""]
["00:49,060","00:50,500","\"Like if you knew it worked.\""]
["00:50,500","00:51,420","\"Yeah, if you knew it worked.\""]
["00:51,420","00:52,660","\"I wouldn't risk it.\""]
["00:52,660","00:55,860","\"Yeah, also I guess it'd be the same thing with the teleporter.\""]
["00:55,860","00:59,220","\"- Yeah, would you know it worked unless you actually tried it?\""]
["00:59,220","01:01,940","\"- Yeah, but it'd be like if they invented teleportation,\""]
["01:01,940","01:03,620","\"like how do you know it doesn't just kill you\""]
["01:03,620","01:04,940","\"and create a copy of you?\""]
["01:04,940","01:06,540","\"- Yeah, it's like how can I be sure\""]
["01:06,540","01:09,720","\"that the thing that comes out of this is really me?\""]
["01:09,720","01:14,100","\"- Yeah, I wouldn't risk it, Lyle, sorry.\""]
["01:14,100","01:16,060","\"- What if your friend did it and he came out\""]
["01:16,060","01:19,020","\"and he was exactly the same, but he had a bigger dick?\""]
["01:19,020","01:21,900","\"And he was like, oh yeah, I just do this every time\""]
["01:21,900","01:23,100","\"I need a bigger dick.\""]
["01:23,100","01:25,220","\"(laughing)\""]
["01:25,220","01:27,620","\"- Every time, why would he do that more than once?\""]
["01:27,620","01:29,100","\"- He started really small.\""]
["01:29,100","01:29,940","\"- Yes.\""]
["01:29,940","01:32,740","\"- First he was in short girls\""]
["01:32,740","01:35,180","\"and then he needed to fuck a taller girl.\""]
["01:35,180","01:37,380","\"So he needed a little bit bigger of a dick.\""]
["01:37,380","01:38,300","\"- Is that how it works?\""]
["01:38,300","01:40,580","\"Your height determines the depth and breadth\""]
["01:40,580","01:41,660","\"of your vagina?\""]
["01:41,660","01:42,580","\"- I think so, yeah.\""]
["01:42,580","01:43,580","\"- You're Virginia.\""]
["01:43,580","01:45,180","\"- Oh, all right.\""]
["01:45,180","01:46,900","\"- These rocks are bleeding.\""]
["01:46,900","01:48,100","\"- Punch the blood hole.\""]
["01:48,100","01:49,020","\"- Don't bleed, right?\""]
["01:49,020","01:51,340","\"- Oh yeah, I think if you land in the red part,\""]
["01:51,340","01:52,580","\"does it, are you safe?\""]
["01:52,580","01:54,220","\"- I think you can punch it in the red part.\""]
["01:54,220","01:56,780","\"Oh, yeah, it's like a weak spot. Yeah\""]
["01:56,780","02:03,380","\"No, I'm not good. I might have also just lied to you, but I try um\""]
["02:03,380","02:10,480","\"Yeah, look at that. Whoa, well, you're pretty cool. I know video games and such. Oh, no, can I shoot that in the red try?\""]
["02:10,480","02:16,900","\"You gotta do it better. I guess not I really don't think that has anything to do with anything useful\""]
["02:16,900","02:19,900","\"It's just something to keep your little brother from asking for the controller\""]
["02:21,820","02:26,220","\"Really always seem that way to me. Okay. I'm sure the game will tell you what they're for\""]
["02:26,220","02:29,100","\"Holding the controller right now. It's kind of hard to aim this shit. Look at that\""]
["02:29,100","02:34,460","\"That might be easier with like the little like we flaperoonies, but yeah, we don't want to use those\""]
["02:34,460","02:36,460","\"We want to use a big comfortable\""]
["02:36,460","02:41,620","\"Masked I wish they'd just dropped that entire aspect of the game. I'd they should just take it out\""]
["02:41,620","02:45,140","\"But it is very optional. You could just ignore it\""]
["02:45,140","02:48,700","\"What if you're a new player like Chris O'Neil? You don't know what the fuck's happening?\""]
["02:49,860","02:52,340","\"Then your friends will tell you just ignore him\""]
["02:52,340","02:59,940","\"I do think the original didn't have a button that you could press to do that spin. I think you actually had to flail your arms\""]
["02:59,940","03:04,620","\"I'm happy about that. Yeah, did you say I remember having to flail the Wii mode a lot?\""]
["03:04,620","03:05,180","\"Yeah\""]
["03:05,180","03:10,820","\"You had to shake your hips from left to right and do the Mario or whatever the fuck that stupid song said wait\""]
["03:10,820","03:12,820","\"So you gotta go\""]
["03:12,820","03:15,620","\"Cool. Oh is that a much yeah?\""]
["03:17,220","03:21,680","\"He's saying that so you're saying like he's like a cordicette he takes over your fucking mind\""]
["03:21,680","03:26,820","\"I was really scared makes Mario climb to the top of the tree and then sprouts a mushroom out of his head\""]
["03:26,820","03:35,000","\"Don't hurt me. No, oh can you punch that you know massive dick of a plant or do you have to shoot it?\""]
["03:35,000","03:37,000","\"No, you can go you just kind of fuck it\""]
["03:37,000","03:41,740","\"Who a little secret area? I'm not down with this at all\""]
["03:43,100","03:47,320","\"You solved the puzzle that was pretty impressed. Do you think I'm clever?\""]
["03:47,320","03:53,460","\"Our video game shut off our video game shut off\""]
["03:53,460","03:56,580","\"your dead\""]
["03:56,580","04:05,020","\"It died no Mario Galaxy the game for literal tiny children\""]
["04:05,020","04:11,660","\"If a tiny child saw you playing this game so horribly he could think that he could defeat you\""]
["04:12,220","04:14,220","\"And then you'd have a challenge on your hands\""]
["04:14,220","04:18,320","\"You'd showed weakness\""]
["04:18,320","04:25,200","\"That on the spikes damn it\""]
["04:25,200","04:31,020","\"There's an invisible man there clobber that invisible Cooper. I don't want to do that kill it\""]
["04:31,020","04:35,620","\"Fuck you take that you bitch ghosts. That's invisible\""]
["04:35,620","04:41,140","\"He's a fucking asshole. Where did he go invisible that invisible?\""]
["04:41,140","04:45,860","\"What's that that's from uh freakazoid I think\""]
["04:45,860","04:51,940","\"Wait, there was an invisible in freakazoid. I think he was I don't know if it was called invisible or invisible\""]
["04:51,940","04:55,140","\"It was something like it may have just been invisible actually\""]
["04:55,140","04:59,300","\"My god, it was a real thing wait\""]
["04:59,300","05:06,660","\"You know I thought that was the funniest thing in the world when that came out I think I was like 11 I know me too\""]
["05:08,260","05:15,180","\"Wait, so this is evolution right this yeah, no, this is an egg. No, it's evolution right\""]
["05:15,180","05:20,700","\"Like the process in which this came to be I can probably want to attack its tail ball\""]
["05:20,700","05:22,580","\"There you go\""]
["05:22,580","05:28,180","\"This is this thing's first moments of life and you've just thrown it immediately into combat\""]
["05:28,180","05:34,020","\"I like killing you yeah based purely on its resemblance to your former enemies if that's not racism. I don't know what is\""]
["05:34,020","05:36,860","\"Punch its ass. Yeah, there you go\""]
["05:36,860","05:43,540","\"Like for all you know this thing would have never been hostile toward you could have been your best friend\""]
["05:43,540","05:53,180","\"Yeah, I know I started its life off by brutally attacking it. Yeah, I mean this is essentially just clubbing a baby seal at this point\""]
["05:53,180","05:57,820","\"I think that's fine. Yeah, but you're not even getting a coat out of it. I actually I don't know what Mario's gonna\""]
["05:57,820","06:04,140","\"Do with it. He might see nobody ever oh nobody ever talks about the baby seals like scalping people and shit\""]
["06:06,460","06:10,860","\"Is that angle I suppose everyone's always oh the people came in and fucked with the baby seals\""]
["06:10,860","06:14,360","\"No, these baby seals were I think you should just run straight away from him\""]
["06:14,360","06:20,660","\"If he's coming at you too quick the baby seals were savages they had priors. I'm just saying\""]
["06:20,660","06:29,260","\"That moment when you get home from a long day and work and you just lie on your bed and you fall asleep and you\""]
["06:29,260","06:36,060","\"Burst into a star wait, that's a that's a regular star. Oh, yeah, they're just regular stars\""]
["06:36,060","06:42,140","\"That's some Pluto goofy shit. I know right in a world full of like sentient stars\""]
["06:42,140","06:48,140","\"They're still object stars with eyes that look almost exactly like like the sentient ones\""]
["06:48,140","06:52,900","\"So when goofy looks at Pluto, he's like I'm sorry you're a slave brother\""]
["06:52,900","06:55,020","\"But yeah, no\""]
["06:55,020","06:57,960","\"Pudgyness seems like a definite theme in Mario Galaxy\""]
["06:57,960","07:02,460","\"Everything's fat. Everything's just a little pudgy or a little rounder\""]
["07:03,020","07:08,040","\"It might actually be the equivalent of like if we found aliens that had monkeys as slaves\""]
["07:08,040","07:14,500","\"That might be what what goofy sees in like Pluto or it's just like it's got resemblance to me\""]
["07:14,500","07:16,040","\"But him and I are not\""]
["07:16,040","07:18,040","\"Let it's not me and that lady\""]
["07:18,040","07:25,200","\"Slavery's good if you're getting a good result. I'm just saying the pyramids couldn't have gotten done otherwise\""]
["07:25,200","07:30,540","\"Oh, this guy eats your fucking stars\""]
["07:30,540","07:37,540","\"Did you say let's pop those little morsels on my face?\""]
["07:37,540","07:44,220","\"Yeah, so something like that so you can you can fuck with enemies or you can feed them or you can kiss them\""]
["07:44,220","07:46,340","\"Yeah, you could I mean maybe\""]
["07:46,340","07:54,140","\"Could you only got the one star you got get at least one more before you can go to the next galaxy\""]
["07:54,140","08:00,340","\"Is it gonna tell me the next thing I gotta do could you imagine the central bristles of Mario's mustache?\""]
["08:00,340","08:02,340","\"rubbing against your own\""]
["08:02,340","08:13,300","\"What does the ASMR stand for asthma something sensory meridian response really I forget what the a stands for that's the only thing\""]
["08:13,300","08:15,980","\"I can't remember. Oh, yeah, I probably audio yeah\""]
["08:15,980","08:24,540","\"Audio sensory meridian response. I think that it's some made-up crap like ASMR is like definitely a real phenomenon\""]
["08:24,940","08:28,720","\"But I think a lot of the people behind it are like pseudo scientific quacks\""]
["08:28,720","08:34,400","\"So and I think a lot of people are just jacking off to it. Yeah, I don't look down upon it or anything\""]
["08:34,400","08:41,040","\"But the community is weird to me. I was gonna say I inherently get cringe from it like it's it's the most\""]
["08:41,040","08:45,300","\"Ross form of cringe to me whenever I hear it\""]
["08:45,300","08:50,200","\"I hate it either it'll make me horny or it'll make\""]
["08:51,740","08:57,600","\"Either response is weird, but either it makes me horny or it makes me feel like a baby to like experience it\""]
["08:57,600","09:00,000","\"I don't like either one. Oh, I see\""]
["09:00,000","09:07,720","\"Yeah, I don't know. I don't even know what it is. I feel like a lot of it is just like borderline porn\""]
["09:07,720","09:10,840","\"Maybe it's just the ones that have like cropped up for me\""]
["09:10,840","09:16,880","\"I'm gonna say for me like it's the content is almost irrelevant. It's all just about the actual like\""]
["09:17,800","09:25,520","\"The the audio like it's more about the technical qualities of the audio than about any of the content of what's being done or said or\""]
["09:25,520","09:31,320","\"And I almost never watch it with visuals. I always am just I have a little Bluetooth\""]
["09:31,320","09:34,920","\"Speaker that that's designed to go under my pillow\""]
["09:34,920","09:41,600","\"I'm just saying it's it's a mighty awful coincidence that something that purely has to do with audio is\""]
["09:41,600","09:46,440","\"Space dominated almost entirely by insanely hot women\""]
["09:46,880","09:51,320","\"No, you're not wrong. There's that's definitely an aspect to it\""]
["09:51,320","09:55,040","\"It's like to why people will get popular in that community\""]
["09:55,040","09:59,120","\"What not that there's anything wrong with it, but I\""]
["09:59,120","10:02,080","\"Don't know. I don't know what to do with my hands\""]
["10:02,080","10:10,440","\"I mean, I just I can't imagine the people that just like sit fully awake looking at their computer screens with headphones on listening to ASMR\""]
["10:10,440","10:14,400","\"that I I'm sure there are those people and you know you do you but\""]
["10:14,840","10:21,040","\"That just seems awkward to me. Hey shove shit down my fucking throat you Paisano\""]
["10:21,040","10:27,580","\"If you feed me a bunch of star bits I'll burst with snacky happiness. He wants to make him explode. Oh\""]
["10:27,580","10:31,520","\"100 damn it I should have been collecting 100\""]
["10:31,520","10:34,800","\"You fucking fat little bastard. Oh\""]
["10:34,800","10:40,320","\"I will fat shame you till the dogs come home you fat repulsive\""]
["10:40,320","10:44,960","\"So I gotta get back out there and collect these get back out there and collect them so yeah\""]
["10:44,960","10:51,480","\"You gotta put yourself out there. You gotta find a nice girl. You gotta get those. Oh fuck you\""]
["10:51,480","10:54,480","\"I literally looked at the controller while this happened\""]
["10:54,480","10:59,080","\"Whoa, okay, well that worked that was nice\""]
["10:59,080","11:06,800","\"And now the hunter has become the hunter I\""]
["11:07,200","11:12,700","\"Hope that Peach is watching all of this happen and just saw that and her gut to sink\""]
["11:12,700","11:20,000","\"I really do believe she's like some creep. I thought you were better. I'm gonna be stuck here forever\""]
["11:20,000","11:23,840","\"Aren't I this is just gonna be my life now have your played super princess Peach?\""]
["11:23,840","11:27,800","\"I have not she shows a pineapple up there unit, you know\""]
["11:27,800","11:35,000","\"That's where she gets her power in that game you have to like platform around and like cry and have your period and shit, right?\""]
["11:35,480","11:40,580","\"And wax your armpits yeah wax your armpits take birth control\""]
["11:40,580","11:45,920","\"Look how do you even get back to that dude? I don't even remember where he was\""]
["11:45,920","11:51,880","\"I think you're on a loop. I think you'll get back to him eventually. I think you kind of can't avoid it. I think that\""]
["11:51,880","11:55,180","\"He'll always be hunting you is the theme of this\""]
["11:55,180","12:03,360","\"particular mission is the theme it was called something to snack something so I think so I always thought counting was like one of the most\""]
["12:03,520","12:08,800","\"Overrated stupid robotic things a person could do when they taught me at a count in math class\""]
["12:08,800","12:15,600","\"I'm like yeah, what am I ever gonna use this exactly and to this day you haven't right now never oh my god\""]
["12:15,600","12:20,120","\"I hate to inform you that those 40 probably didn't even\""]
["12:20,120","12:26,960","\"Bitch oh no wasting them again. No that no time. It's definitely counting no\""]
["12:26,960","12:30,840","\"It's counting but when I leave to get more it totally glitched out it counts\""]
["12:30,840","12:33,920","\"Yeah, that was counted, but the last time you just shot him\""]
["12:33,920","12:38,180","\"They totally had you feed that other one the same way unless it didn't count for him either\""]
["12:38,180","12:39,880","\"Are these different ones?\""]
["12:39,880","12:40,360","\"No, no\""]
["12:40,360","12:46,320","\"I think I think they dropped a ball on on the on the visual cues there because how could you have known it was supposed to do all that\""]
["12:46,320","12:50,200","\"Unless it had done that before yeah, I don't want to be mean\""]
["12:50,200","12:52,800","\"but\""]
["12:52,800","12:57,520","\"You know I'm just gonna be mean fuck it. I think my meadow should just pack it in\""]

["13:19,240","13:23,140","\"I just in my head. It was just like a knockoff of rat tattoo\""]
["13:23,140","13:26,240","\"It was in production hell for 14 years and then they canceled it\""]
["13:26,240","13:30,440","\"But rats too came out because they sold the rights to it dude that germ a guy\""]
["13:30,440","13:35,260","\"He should make that we're the rats but make it into like cats and have a whole play about we're the rats\""]
