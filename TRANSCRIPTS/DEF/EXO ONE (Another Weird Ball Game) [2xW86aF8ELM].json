["04:24,280","04:28,160","\"I don't think I could do it. Just as a disc to try to glide up it\""]
["04:28,160","04:31,360","\"Damn\""]
["04:31,360","04:34,620","\"Did you see that the wind help me? Yeah, there's like a solar wind\""]

["05:24,880","05:27,360","\"in this game then all games\""]
["05:29,400","05:35,920","\"Sometimes I don't think it's appropriate but here it gives it like a like a Mars rover footage kind of look\""]
["05:35,920","05:41,860","\"Yeah, true. I think it thematically fits. Oh, I think that's here. That's your level boundary\""]
["05:41,860","05:44,560","\"It wants me to go over to that light probably yeah\""]
["05:44,560","05:53,280","\"Oh, there's like what it was long. There's like trees or something. Yeah, that is exactly an alien tree. Oh\""]
["05:57,280","05:59,280","\"The atmosphere is so fucking cool\""]
["05:59,280","06:06,900","\"So this this planet is called like far tiggy is for or something right yeah something like that it always\""]
["06:06,900","06:09,720","\"Was strange to me and like\""]
["06:09,720","06:15,060","\"And like sci-fi and stuff like that when a planet like has like a number\""]
["06:15,060","06:20,120","\"Just because it's like if it's a planet that's got aliens and shit on it\""]
["06:20,120","06:25,320","\"When you get there and the aliens would be like oh, yeah, this is called like plon\""]
["06:25,320","06:30,320","\"They wouldn't call it like some weird numerical thing.\""]
["06:30,320","06:31,320","\"- They would agree with you,\""]
["06:31,320","06:33,320","\"but it's like a, we call Germany Germany,\""]
["06:33,320","06:34,320","\"they call it Deutschland.\""]
["06:34,320","06:37,320","\"- Yeah, but if you got to Germany and you were like,\""]
["06:37,320","06:40,320","\"this is, this is Pangeas 4, and they're like,\""]
["06:40,320","06:42,320","\"it's Deutschland, you'd probably be like,\""]
["06:42,320","06:44,320","\"yeah, it's probably better, you know?\""]
["06:44,320","06:46,320","\"- You say we should be calling Germany Deutschland.\""]
["06:46,320","06:48,320","\"- No, because Germany is a word.\""]
["06:48,320","06:51,320","\"- Yeah, but they call themselves Deutschland.\""]
["06:51,320","06:54,320","\"- Isn't that silly?\""]
["06:54,320","06:56,960","\"So that's just they just got it wrong.\""]
["06:56,960","06:58,160","\"We'll just messed off.\""]
["06:58,160","06:59,920","\"But I think I think if you've got a number.\""]
["06:59,920","07:01,360","\"Oh, you scared off that.\""]
["07:01,360","07:04,400","\"If you got a number on it, safe to say you're wrong, you know?\""]
["07:04,400","07:07,200","\"I love those droplets on the screen.\""]
["07:07,200","07:10,000","\"I love that music is perfect for this type of game too.\""]
["07:10,000","07:12,400","\"Yeah, it's nice and vibey.\""]
["07:12,400","07:15,360","\"Makes me feel like we're an interstellar the movie or something.\""]
["07:15,360","07:20,160","\"I feel like if I were and don't laugh\""]
["07:20,160","07:21,760","\"because I know this is a funny subject,\""]
["07:21,760","07:29,280","\"But I feel like genuinely this would be like a good weed game. Oh fucking zone out and light one up\""]
["07:29,280","07:33,440","\"Yeah, if you live in a state where it's legal which we do which which we do oh\""]
["07:33,440","07:40,840","\"This would be fun as fuck to play in VR. I don't know if I stick but\""]
["07:40,840","07:45,080","\"Really good it never feels like it slows down or anything\""]
["07:45,080","07:51,200","\"Is that really where I'm going am I getting closer seems like it earlier at the bottom left a little thing\""]
["07:51,200","07:55,520","\"Pup it said model at 40 kilometers or something. So you're going through some\""]
["07:55,520","07:59,720","\"model. Look at me go dude. I love these you whole ass.\""]
["07:59,720","08:03,800","\"Yeah. You know, it's like even though it's technically far away, the fact that\""]
["08:03,800","08:09,000","\"it moves so fast makes it feel. It's fucking worth it. It doesn't feel like\""]
["08:09,000","08:14,200","\"you're traveling a large distance. It's such a clever idea for a game. Yeah.\""]
["08:14,200","08:19,040","\"It's like weird dream logic. It's really fun. It does feel like a lucid dream or\""]
["08:19,040","08:24,800","\"something yeah baby cuz if you had\""]
["08:24,800","08:26,440","\"dreams you travel about that fast it's\""]
["08:26,440","08:29,320","\"like you're just a weird ball here\""]
["08:29,320","08:34,160","\"your political book yeah oh yeah look at\""]

["08:39,620","08:41,360","\"clicking on the air you glide like that\""]
["08:41,360","08:44,280","\"I don't know maybe we can upgrade it at\""]
["08:44,280","08:47,000","\"some point oh does that run out yeah it\""]
["08:47,000","08:51,560","\"Yeah, I wish there was little like Sasquatch's walking around that you could run over\""]

["08:56,200","08:58,720","\"Yeah, the top was head off of that\""]
["08:58,720","09:02,080","\"Yeah, see it fizzles out, then you're forced to roll\""]
["09:02,080","09:08,100","\"Like their legs just fucking explode. I don't know how big this thing is like I don't know\""]
["09:08,100","09:10,600","\"Yeah, really size like a person or like a little yeah\""]
["09:10,600","09:16,040","\"I don't know if we're like Mars Rover sized or if we're like guy sized, you know\""]

["09:21,380","09:25,720","\"So I assume judging by the size of the smoke I say we're four feet tall\""]
["09:25,720","09:31,880","\"Well, that what it seems like but you never know could just be like really tall bushes and shit\""]
["09:31,880","09:34,120","\"Whoa\""]

["10:27,840","10:30,520","\"shit, we're back\""]
["10:30,520","10:34,340","\"We're back to run another planet. It's pretty cool\""]
["10:34,340","10:40,400","\"Yeah, the sound design is great - you really feel you're in the wind. Yeah, I feel like the winds between my toes right now\""]
["10:41,040","10:47,120","\"What planet do you think this is oh look at that make they already said it was called like no we just called on nearly on\""]
["10:47,120","10:49,680","\"Five, but what's the point of it?\""]

["10:59,440","11:07,760","\"Doesn't do is I hope that it's not just rolling the entire way like I better remote the transportation like I hope there's like things to do\""]
["11:08,560","11:11,360","\"Yeah, you have to have stuff in the world to do I agree. What the fuck?\""]

["11:43,880","11:56,460","\"Yeah, I think that this is pretty much what the game is probably gonna be but it's probably just like a journey kind of a game\""]

["12:12,140","12:14,820","\"- Some kind of enemy or just something\""]

["12:25,900","12:28,420","\"like I know you were kind of joking,\""]
["12:28,420","12:31,340","\"but if there was actually a giant robot\""]
["12:31,340","12:35,340","\"something that you could just pound through. That would actually be so sick.\""]
["12:35,340","12:41,340","\"We're living a giant like a four-legged alien and you slam through like a bullet.\""]
["12:41,340","12:47,100","\"Yeah. That would legitimately be sick like if you like went through like the meat.\""]
["12:47,100","12:56,380","\"Yeah. So when you find these do they carry you? I guess so. Whoa. What are we going for?\""]
["12:56,380","13:03,960","\"Energy source protected. Yeah, so there I assume the energy source is that thing. Can we go to it? Yeah\""]

["14:15,540","14:19,620","\"Oh, it doesn't only\""]
["14:21,540","14:27,260","\"Me too. Holy shit. You should have got into the scary hell of this. I'm not going down there again\""]
["14:27,260","14:31,760","\"Can we even get up? Oh God shouldn't have gotten this far down. Oh\""]
["14:31,760","14:34,820","\"It sucks you up. Okay, good\""]
["14:34,820","14:37,420","\"Why did you shoot Jupiter back there? Why did?\""]
["14:37,420","14:40,100","\"Cuz you went too low was that Jupiter?\""]
["14:40,100","14:44,460","\"The last time it flashed like all those astronauts\""]
["14:44,460","14:49,680","\"Yeah, which I assume you're like trying to like save or something like their lost\""]

["14:54,020","14:56,880","\"Law we're on a road trip. Yeah\""]
["14:56,880","15:04,220","\"You look at the window there's a moose that's 20 foot tall. It's and in its mouth is this ball\""]

["15:16,440","15:19,080","\"No this ball that we're playing as this\""]
["15:19,080","15:23,280","\"Yeah, well then I know how big it is I guess relative to a mouse\""]
["15:23,280","15:34,040","\"It is a fucking JPEG of Jupiter. I try to acquire its great power, but you try taking the ball out of its mouth and\""]
["15:34,040","15:41,540","\"You absorb the energy of the ball, then you start flying around ramping up in down mountains like this, but you can't stop\""]
["15:41,540","15:44,280","\"Well, then I just wouldn't stop\""]
["15:44,280","15:48,040","\"That'd be my life then how long do you think you could go before going crazy?\""]
["15:48,040","15:55,980","\"I feel like that would be like almost the opposite of solitary confinement where like\""]
["15:55,980","16:00,280","\"You're too free. Yeah, you'd be like overstimulated constantly\""]
["16:00,280","16:05,480","\"Before Steve before us to a life of moving around constantly. Yeah, I mean would just be broke\""]
["16:05,480","16:10,800","\"I think you would see everything you would just like start to see yourself as like a god\""]
["16:10,800","16:13,480","\"Because you\""]
["16:13,480","16:17,360","\"That's I time a little bit yeah, yeah, you're stopping\""]
["16:17,360","16:24,400","\"Yeah, you're watching a movie you become an Adderall addict and like you're moving at such a rate that you'd probably like\""]
["16:24,400","16:28,160","\"Like you'd go around the earth at some point, right?\""]
["16:28,160","16:32,040","\"So you'd start to see things in different stages of time\""]
["16:32,040","16:39,520","\"Yeah, you'd see like like the Western civilization collapsing. Yeah, but you wouldn't know you wouldn't know until you got back, right?\""]
["16:39,520","16:45,160","\"Yeah, you're right like so like you probably like find your way home like at some point you'd be like I need to get home\""]
["16:45,160","16:48,240","\"I need to just see it again. They'd be completely different, you know\""]
["16:48,240","16:51,640","\"Yeah, cuz it'd be you know five or ten years or something. Mm-hmm. That was kind of cool\""]
["16:51,640","16:56,820","\"And it doesn't matter cuz it'd just be like a blink in your eye anyway, you know\""]
["16:56,820","17:02,400","\"It's like oh, I guess I know that's hell you describe me hell. Where the fuck am I going?\""]

["17:09,600","17:13,640","\"I guess the question is if you like I'm assuming if you're this ball you never die\""]
["17:13,640","17:18,720","\"Nice, you seem like I almost died back there. I'm adding the rule that you never die\""]
["17:18,720","17:25,680","\"I'm adding that you're immortal if you say so because at some point you might want to just like\""]
["17:25,680","17:28,520","\"Stop existing right\""]
["17:28,520","17:36,200","\"True so you either you'd have two options you'd either have to launch yourself like into the Sun or something\""]
["17:36,200","17:40,700","\"Which would be a risky move. Yeah, or you'd have to like decimate the earth\""]
["17:40,700","17:51,360","\"That'd be a good villain actually like a good relatable like Marvel villain. That's in the movie heavy metal. There's an evil orb\""]
["17:51,360","17:57,760","\"Yeah, but but this one this one its whole thing is it can't move it can't stop moving\""]
["17:57,760","18:01,920","\"It's just can't I love that I am got an angle\""]
["18:01,920","18:05,960","\"Well, he'd teach me about shaders. Okay. Well\""]
["18:05,960","18:12,120","\"First thing you got to know right is that you got to put like a shadow on it true and when that's on there\""]
["18:12,120","18:16,040","\"Then you can connect the little node to the ideograph\""]
["18:16,040","18:22,080","\"Right, and it'll create textures and then the ball comes out. You're just actually bullshitting\""]
["18:22,080","18:27,860","\"I know right, but it sounds like I'm not kind of almost I want to keep it sounding like I'm a little bit bullshitting\""]
["18:27,860","18:33,340","\"We will made it to this thing. Yeah, that's good. You're supposed to get even later. I did we'll see\""]

["18:45,580","18:52,060","\"Seems like the beacon is the end goal of every level\""]
["18:52,060","19:00,700","\"Okay, I can't get to the beacon. What is that? There's a little thing what thing little thing flying around\""]
["19:01,100","19:04,480","\"What are you talking about right there in front of me that line oh?\""]
["19:04,480","19:09,760","\"Yeah, the line like a like a snake or something. No, I see it. You're not losing it\""]
["19:09,760","19:13,740","\"Oh, yeah, it's like a little worm or a snake or something. What is that little worm or snake or something?\""]

["19:30,500","19:33,400","\"It's going up it. This is the scary music to play\""]
["19:33,400","19:41,360","\"That might be like it just a guiding line because it kind of looks like a jet stream or something lost contact with object\""]
["19:41,360","19:43,840","\"Okay, never mind that was probably what it was\""]
["19:43,840","19:46,600","\"a little worm or something\""]
