["05:11,080","05:15,420","\"The day and night cycle is kind of artificial, but it looks better for it\""]

["06:20,860","06:22,060","\"What do they do?\""]
["06:22,060","06:27,260","\"They decided that she actually caused things intentionally\""]

["11:06,160","11:07,440","\"You got a lot later on.\""]
["11:07,440","11:09,960","\"- What?\""]
["11:09,960","11:11,360","\"- A fucking motion blur.\""]
["11:11,360","11:12,760","\"- Why do you like motion blur?\""]
["11:12,760","11:14,660","\"- It takes off all impact from something\""]
["11:14,660","11:15,680","\"that's moving fast.\""]
["11:15,680","11:16,520","\"- Does it?\""]
["11:16,520","11:18,200","\"- It makes it look too slow.\""]
["11:18,200","11:21,800","\"- It makes it look faster, I think.\""]
["11:21,800","11:23,200","\"Curse your animator.\""]
["11:23,200","11:24,800","\"- What, yes.\""]
["11:24,800","11:27,980","\"Motion blur happens because things are moving fast.\""]

["11:33,960","11:35,200","\"hit somebody.\""]
["11:35,200","11:37,440","\"Yeah, the movement itself looks fast.\""]
["11:37,440","11:39,120","\"I guess it's just the impact that I don't like.\""]
["11:39,120","11:41,280","\"- It says it pauses when you hit them.\""]
["11:41,280","11:42,680","\"- Oh yeah, why does it do that?\""]
["11:42,680","11:43,840","\"- 'Cause it always does that.\""]
["11:43,840","11:44,840","\"- Why?\""]
["11:44,840","11:46,600","\"- Just to make it feel more satisfying, I guess.\""]
["11:46,600","11:47,440","\"- Oh.\""]
["11:47,440","11:48,280","\"- 'Cause that's what Zelda would be doing.\""]

["11:59,840","12:01,480","\"- He looks like it.\""]
["12:01,480","12:02,320","\"- What does he look like?\""]
["12:02,320","12:04,160","\"- He looks like Reggie Phil's Hammy.\""]

["12:21,840","12:24,240","\"- I think they got away.\""]
["12:24,240","12:25,760","\"- It just looks like her.\""]

["13:40,460","13:41,460","\"No, it wasn't.\""]
["13:41,460","13:45,700","\"It was to get a game running pretty well with a lot of stuff on screen.\""]

["14:09,200","14:15,400","\"Wow, I'm gonna start a play. I don't mind the actual character animations. It's just a lip-syncing in this game. Yeah\""]
["14:15,880","14:17,880","\"You ain't planning going out of the mall\""]
["14:17,880","14:24,480","\"Remember this was a common problem when it came out because it was so early on not everyone had an HD TV\""]
["14:24,480","14:27,760","\"Yeah, same. That was me. Yeah, I couldn't read me too. I couldn't read anything\""]
["14:27,760","14:30,900","\"Yeah, that's what happened to me when I tried to play Rayman\""]
["14:30,900","14:33,940","\"Origins really all the text was really tiny\""]
["14:33,940","14:40,440","\"I remember none of my friends wanted to come over to play Halo because they had HD TVs and I didn't so they didn't want to play\""]

["14:41,440","14:42,280","\"- Oh.\""]

["14:46,520","14:47,360","\"- What did you say?\""]
["14:47,360","14:50,280","\"- That's because I didn't run into that problem\""]
["14:50,280","14:53,240","\"until it was like 2011, I think.\""]
["14:53,240","14:56,560","\"When the Halo 3 came out, 2007.\""]
["14:56,560","14:58,960","\"- I think it was, 2008.\""]

["15:00,200","15:01,040","\"- Yeah, I guess I just--\""]

["15:02,760","15:03,800","\"I think it was 2006.\""]
["15:03,800","15:06,640","\"- Yeah, so like 2007 when I was out,\""]
["15:06,640","15:08,960","\"that probably just speaks to how behind I am\""]
["15:08,960","15:13,820","\"because I never, I never, I didn't have an HDTV until I never probably a triple-A game.\""]
["15:13,820","15:15,140","\"So I never run into that problem.\""]
["15:15,140","15:18,640","\"- Yeah, 2011. Maybe.\""]
["15:18,640","15:21,240","\"- That's a really good animation.\""]
["15:21,240","15:25,260","\"- I like kicking the ball too.\""]
["15:25,260","15:26,040","\"- You should just kill her.\""]

["15:29,040","15:30,520","\"- Shit, I missed.\""]
["15:30,520","15:31,960","\"- You do it in front of her husband.\""]

["15:37,760","15:42,940","\"It'd be really fun. You're not gonna kill her. Nothing on the roof kills them in one hit\""]
