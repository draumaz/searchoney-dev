["00:08,300","00:09,280","\"[Music]\""]
["00:09,280","00:10,540","\"With friends.\""]
["00:10,540","00:13,300","\"Additional credit. You want to look at the additional credits, you guys?\""]
["00:13,300","00:16,740","\"We don't want to eat dessert before we eat dinner. Come on, man.\""]
["00:16,740","00:17,480","\"[Laughter]\""]
["00:17,480","00:19,220","\"I like your style, baby.\""]
["00:19,220","00:20,600","\"Okay, we good.\""]
["00:20,600","00:21,600","\"All right.\""]
["00:21,600","00:25,900","\"Yeah, when that Chocobos running, don't turn off the game, Telmar.\""]
["00:25,900","00:26,800","\"Okay.\""]
["00:26,800","00:29,160","\"Don't run over the computer and kick the computer.\""]
["00:29,160","00:31,000","\"I really wish you'd stop bringing that up.\""]
["00:31,000","00:33,080","\"I really wish you'd stop bringing that up.\""]
["00:33,080","00:33,920","\"Dude, what?\""]
["00:33,920","00:35,080","\"Dude, is there a story?\""]
["00:35,080","00:36,400","\"When I was a boy, I used to think that--\""]
["00:36,400","00:37,640","\"This could be a life chance.\""]
["00:37,640","00:40,720","\"You know it was such a babe, and then I became a man,\""]
["00:40,720","00:42,960","\"and then I realized it was all about Lulu,\""]
["00:42,960","00:45,040","\"and then I became a jaded and angry man,\""]
["00:45,040","00:47,440","\"and I realized Lulu is the kind of bitch\""]
["00:47,440","00:49,000","\"that would probably mix her period\""]
["00:49,000","00:50,240","\"in with your spaghetti sauce,\""]
["00:50,240","00:52,280","\"because she thinks it'll make you love her forever.\""]
["00:52,280","00:54,040","\"I think nearly every character in this group\""]
["00:54,040","00:55,600","\"is fucked up in a weird way.\""]
["00:55,600","00:56,640","\"You think?\""]
["00:56,640","00:59,040","\"Wok is okay, but he's kind of annoying as hell.\""]
["00:59,040","01:03,160","\"I think everybody is cool except for Tetus.\""]
["01:03,160","01:05,560","\"Tetus, Titus, whatever.\""]
["01:05,560","01:08,000","\"If I hung out with Yuna for like four days in a row.\""]
["01:08,000","01:12,440","\"Yuna is the correct way to say it, but Titus is the way all the normal people have said it.\""]
["01:12,440","01:13,280","\"It sounds cooler.\""]
["01:13,280","01:17,040","\"Well, Yuna is kind of a rider die bitch, but yeah, if you hung out with her for two,\""]
["01:17,040","01:20,840","\"she'd start praying at you and she would drive me in ballistic.\""]
["01:20,840","01:23,680","\"You think I think Riku would probably drive me nuts.\""]
["01:23,920","01:28,800","\"That'd be the kind of chick that like burns all your clothes because she saw that you were like texting another girl.\""]
["01:28,800","01:31,360","\"That chick, there's the worst one. She's f*ck annoying.\""]
["01:31,360","01:41,520","\"At this point you're supposed to be so excited because it's f*cking 2002 and you just got the first Final Fantasy game to come out on the PlayStation 2.\""]
["01:41,520","01:44,800","\"Oh, you're at, you kind of sent me back there. It gave me Shivers Day in my spine.\""]
["01:44,800","01:45,760","\"Oh wow.\""]
["01:45,760","01:49,680","\"This has the most obtrusive f*cking logo in the background though.\""]
["01:49,680","01:50,960","\"You have to admit that.\""]
["01:50,960","01:56,120","\"Anytime I look out at a horizon, a big logo comes up and it always makes me angry.\""]
["01:56,120","01:58,160","\"Is he gonna say this is our story?\""]
["01:58,160","02:01,760","\"He says then the opening silly. Silly Buss gets you goose.\""]
["02:01,760","02:03,920","\"I'm so sad about that ball!\""]
["02:03,920","02:06,160","\"Now we get to watch the exact thing we just saw.\""]
["02:06,160","02:08,000","\"This is our story.\""]
["02:08,000","02:09,360","\"You love that line, don't you?\""]
["02:09,360","02:10,080","\"It's my story.\""]
["02:10,080","02:12,560","\"He's been saying it since we said we were gonna play this game.\""]
["02:12,560","02:13,920","\"This may be our last chance.\""]
["02:13,920","02:18,800","\"Omar's been running up and down the hallways and his little booties saying this is our story.\""]
["02:19,360","02:21,360","\"And also this may be our last chance.\""]
["02:21,360","02:24,360","\"This is the only Final Fantasy game that I've ever beat.\""]
["02:24,360","02:27,360","\"Seven is the only one I ever beat, and I got to the very end of this game\""]
["02:27,360","02:30,060","\"and couldn't get past the boss at the end. I just never played it again.\""]
["02:30,060","02:32,060","\"Listen to my story.\""]
["02:32,060","02:34,060","\"There it is. Listen to my story, yeah.\""]
["02:34,060","02:35,660","\"So it wasn't even me.\""]
["02:35,660","02:36,760","\"Yeah, last chance.\""]
["02:36,760","02:37,660","\"Tomer, you fucked up.\""]
["02:37,660","02:39,060","\"I totally corrected myself.\""]
["02:39,060","02:39,960","\"It's in the video.\""]
["02:39,960","02:43,860","\"I corrected myself as listen to my story like a minute ago.\""]
["02:43,860","02:44,460","\"Okay.\""]
["02:44,460","02:44,960","\"Okay.\""]
["02:44,960","02:45,960","\"All right.\""]
["02:45,960","02:48,060","\"You can review the footage.\""]
["02:48,060","02:50,060","\"Don't cut it out to make me look dope.\""]
["02:50,060","02:51,700","\"- Maybe it's listen to my story.\""]
["02:51,700","02:53,500","\"- Dude, put a D at the end of that there.\""]
["02:53,500","02:54,340","\"Oh, fuck yes.\""]
["02:54,340","02:55,900","\"- Yes.\""]
["02:55,900","02:56,900","\"- That makes me little.\""]
["02:56,900","02:57,980","\"- Final Fantasy XD.\""]
["02:57,980","02:59,980","\"- That's what they should have called it.\""]
["02:59,980","03:02,340","\"Final Fantasy Lion Face Edition.\""]
["03:02,340","03:05,340","\"- I feel like 2002 was probably one of the cringiest\""]
["03:05,340","03:07,860","\"weebiest stages of my life.\""]
["03:07,860","03:11,340","\"- The future has the worst clothes I've come to see.\""]
["03:11,340","03:12,380","\"- And the worst children.\""]
["03:12,380","03:14,580","\"Look at that horrible thing.\""]
["03:14,580","03:17,900","\"- I actually really liked this version of the prelude song.\""]
["03:17,900","03:19,600","\"Dude, that's me.\""]
["03:19,600","03:20,100","\"Wait, what?\""]
["03:20,100","03:22,300","\"I remember this opening part being really cool.\""]
["03:22,300","03:25,100","\"I don't remember that little critter fading into existence.\""]
["03:25,100","03:25,700","\"The critter.\""]
["03:25,700","03:26,700","\"We'll see how it starts out.\""]
["03:26,700","03:29,100","\"We'll see how well you remember Tomar.\""]
["03:29,100","03:32,000","\"You've been saying a lot of things about this and that other game.\""]
["03:32,000","03:33,900","\"Can you please talk to your biggest fans?\""]
["03:33,900","03:37,300","\"I remember the second I heard these guys talking, I freaked out.\""]
["03:37,300","03:40,900","\"Yeah, that even like the average villager had voice acting.\""]
["03:40,900","03:43,500","\"No, they trick you with that.\""]
["03:43,500","03:47,300","\"That guy specifically is cheering for you.\""]
["03:47,300","03:49,700","\"think about him while you play.\""]
["03:49,700","03:52,740","\"- If this was real, they would all be swarming him,\""]
["03:52,740","03:54,380","\"giving him Corona and shit.\""]
["03:54,380","03:56,700","\"- Coughing on his shoes.\""]
["03:56,700","03:58,220","\"- They'd be giving him Conflue.\""]
["03:58,220","04:03,140","\"- They turned out, they canceled basketball, Chris.\""]
["04:03,140","04:04,180","\"- Don't call him Titus.\""]
["04:04,180","04:05,020","\"- Sweet.\""]
["04:05,020","04:05,860","\"- I'm a sweet foe.\""]
["04:05,860","04:06,980","\"Sweet thus.\""]
["04:06,980","04:09,660","\"- Judith, friend of Judith.\""]
["04:09,660","04:12,060","\"- Judith's kind of a Judith.\""]
["04:12,060","04:12,900","\"- Yeah.\""]
["04:12,900","04:13,800","\"- There we go.\""]
["04:13,800","04:15,380","\"- All right, Judith.\""]
["04:15,380","04:20,660","\"I like that. Blitzballs look so fun to kick around. Blitzballs are ribbed for your pleasure.\""]
["04:20,660","04:25,620","\"Or they're, I guess they're studded for your pleasure. That's right, my dad is jacked.\""]
["04:25,620","04:27,380","\"Yeah, jacked is awesome.\""]
["04:27,380","04:28,580","\"Jacked is awesome.\""]
["04:28,580","04:31,780","\"He's the only one that sees you for the little twinkas that you truly are.\""]
["04:31,780","04:34,660","\"That's true. You kicked that thing on the nub, would it hurt?\""]
["04:34,660","04:40,500","\"Each individual nub is the, yeah, a piece of steel. It messes your shins up every time you kick it.\""]
["04:40,500","04:41,940","\"It's a balloon filled with acid.\""]
["04:41,940","04:44,200","\"- Teeth your side of a blast!\""]
["04:44,200","04:45,460","\"You can't tonight.\""]
["04:45,460","04:46,300","\"- Wait, what?\""]
["04:46,300","04:50,060","\"Thanks for bailing me out, strange child\""]
["04:50,060","04:52,660","\"who apparently manages my time.\""]
["04:52,660","04:53,900","\"- All of them in sync.\""]
["04:53,900","04:55,620","\"- I don't like this cultist shit.\""]
["04:55,620","04:58,820","\"- Yes, the weird, and their faces are horrifying.\""]
["04:58,820","05:00,300","\"- That's jacked.\""]
["05:00,300","05:02,060","\"Dude, he's so cool.\""]
["05:02,060","05:05,060","\"He is honestly one of the coolest Final Fantasy characters,\""]
["05:05,060","05:07,540","\"despite him only being in this game for like 10 minutes.\""]
["05:07,540","05:11,460","\"- I think Oran lives up to his cool design.\""]
["05:11,460","05:12,780","\"-Arn's pretty cool, yeah.\""]
["05:12,780","05:15,100","\"-He's got pretty like plump lips.\""]
["05:15,100","05:17,780","\"-Yeah, he's making a weird ass face right there.\""]
["05:17,780","05:20,820","\"-I was in a coffee shop running away from home\""]
["05:20,820","05:21,820","\"when I heard the news.\""]
["05:21,820","05:22,940","\"-When I frozen, please.\""]
["05:22,940","05:26,340","\"-A hero, checked, gone, vanished into thin air.\""]
["05:26,340","05:27,380","\"-Who is this?\""]
["05:27,380","05:28,980","\"This isn't Tito saying this.\""]
["05:28,980","05:32,060","\"-This is supposed to be like some guy on the radio, I think.\""]
["05:32,060","05:40,940","\"I go, \"\"Duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.\"\"\""]
["05:40,940","05:42,060","\"-This is awesome.\""]
["05:42,060","05:44,760","\"Do they have the death metal growls in this part?\""]
["05:44,760","05:45,600","\"-Yeah.\""]
["05:45,600","05:46,260","\"-Sing along.\""]
["05:46,260","05:55,060","\"-Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh. -That's the red man.\""]
["05:55,060","05:56,920","\"Friend of method man.\""]
["05:56,920","05:59,460","\"-Holder of milk.\""]
["05:59,460","06:00,980","\"Delicious.\""]
["06:00,980","06:03,700","\"He's gonna have the strongest bones, he's gonna regrow his arm.\""]
["06:03,700","06:05,220","\"Oh, that's so cool.\""]
["06:05,220","06:07,540","\"Ah, this is nostalgic.\""]
["06:07,540","06:11,100","\"So, Telmar, you said you were a big fan of Blitzball in this game?\""]
["06:11,100","06:14,220","\"I definitely was.\""]
["06:14,220","06:16,500","\"I don't even remember how to play it now, but...\""]
["06:16,500","06:20,920","\"I remember I didn't understand it at all, or I didn't want to, or care.\""]
["06:20,920","06:23,380","\"I think the game makes you play a game of it.\""]
["06:23,380","06:27,700","\"Like there's no point in playing until you start learning the Jackshots, and then those\""]
["06:27,700","06:30,160","\"are basically guaranteed points.\""]
["06:30,160","06:32,160","\"That's how I always play these kinds of games.\""]
["06:32,160","06:33,160","\"If it worked, it works.\""]
["06:33,160","06:34,160","\"Yep.\""]
["06:34,160","06:37,160","\"You're here now, which means you didn't die in the crossfire.\""]
["06:37,160","06:39,660","\"I did not die in the game.\""]
["06:39,660","06:42,160","\"Which in turn makes you die in real life.\""]
["06:42,160","06:43,160","\"Exactly.\""]
["06:43,160","06:45,160","\"I remember when I first saw this, it blew my mind.\""]
["06:45,160","06:46,160","\"Yeah, me too.\""]
["06:46,160","06:47,160","\"It looks so real.\""]
["06:47,160","06:49,160","\"It still holds up.\""]
["06:49,160","06:50,160","\"Yeah, it looks good.\""]
["06:50,160","06:51,160","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:51,160","06:53,160","\"I can't say it's ugly.\""]
["06:53,160","06:56,160","\"They almost got crushed by that Caesar head.\""]
["06:56,160","06:59,160","\"Did this come out first or Kingdom Hearts 1?\""]
["06:59,160","07:02,340","\"I think this I think this is\""]
["07:02,340","07:08,860","\"I remember okay, so it must have been this was when I was like wow particle effects are so cool\""]
["07:08,860","07:12,320","\"He's flapping he's trying to put on all that fire\""]
["07:12,320","07:18,140","\"It's cuz he's asymmetrical with his weird fishnet legging\""]
["07:18,140","07:23,380","\"I like asymmetrical character design, but I don't like his design\""]
["07:23,380","07:27,820","\"Close in this game are ridiculous. Yeah\""]
["07:27,820","07:28,660","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:28,660","07:31,460","\"- I don't even remember this little goon.\""]
["07:31,460","07:34,460","\"- Like his elbow is like a Chinese finger trap.\""]
["07:34,460","07:36,100","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:36,100","07:36,940","\"- It's true.\""]
["07:36,940","07:42,260","\"- I don't remember that kid either, goddamn.\""]
["07:42,260","07:43,860","\"- Does he ever come back?\""]
["07:43,860","07:45,940","\"- No, yeah, that kid's relevant.\""]
["07:45,940","07:47,900","\"He's like a big plot thing.\""]
["07:47,900","07:49,580","\"- Really, I've beaten this game\""]
["07:49,580","07:51,020","\"and I don't remember his existence.\""]
["07:51,020","07:53,180","\"- Okay, big plot thing is probably being generous,\""]
["07:53,180","07:55,380","\"but I feel like it's some twist,\""]
["07:55,380","07:59,380","\"Oh, it's this person traveling through time and crap like that.\""]
["07:59,380","08:03,380","\"Oh, cool.\""]
["08:03,380","08:06,380","\"You did that all on your own?\""]
["08:06,380","08:09,380","\"What's the thing that destroys the world? Oh, yeah, it's sin.\""]
["08:09,380","08:12,380","\"Yeah, it's like a big weird blue whale. It's weird.\""]
["08:12,380","08:15,380","\"It kind of looks like the Cloverfield monster, I think.\""]
["08:15,380","08:21,380","\"All these plots are like, they're just really like high stakes, basic bitch fantasy plots the end of the day.\""]
["08:21,380","08:26,320","\"The source of pure evil needs to be defeated by the source of pure good\""]
["08:26,320","08:30,980","\"I do remember this thing actually seeming like oh shit when it showed up\""]
["08:30,980","08:36,560","\"Huge I'll beat you with my finger trap\""]
["08:36,560","08:44,100","\"Take it you so cool. Yeah, here he is\""]
["08:44,100","08:47,940","\"He gives you a sweet ass\""]
["08:48,500","08:50,940","\"They're taking his other arm out of the little sling.\""]
["08:50,940","08:52,300","\"- I'll give it from Jack.\""]
["08:52,300","08:53,140","\"- Does it work?\""]
["08:53,140","08:54,100","\"- I don't, maybe it doesn't.\""]
["08:54,100","08:55,380","\"Maybe he's like Bob Dole.\""]
["08:55,380","08:56,380","\"- Oh yeah, it does.\""]
["08:56,380","08:59,020","\"He's got Rub in his belly right now.\""]
["08:59,020","09:02,220","\"- Orin also known as the Bob Dole or Final Fantasy.\""]
["09:02,220","09:03,340","\"- Exactly.\""]
["09:03,340","09:06,180","\"This game is just straight up turn-based though, right?\""]
