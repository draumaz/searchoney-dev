["00:06,080","00:14,840","\"Ah, that is a bass clef. Very good. Mmm, yes. Treble clef is the fancy looking one. Yeah, it's the big... crazy G.\""]

["00:17,300","00:28,740","\"I don't remember what we were doing. We're looking for the hint. There it is! Wow, you go to his house. Bottom right. Bottom right? Bottom right? Okay.\""]
["00:28,740","00:35,740","\"I go down here. See the house with the fence. The house with the fence. The white fence.\""]
["00:35,740","00:42,740","\"The white fence. The gate is locked tight. Oh. But they were telling you to go over here, I thought.\""]
["00:42,740","00:46,740","\"So you lied. Okay. They said there was a key.\""]
["00:46,740","00:51,740","\"Let me. So are the key.\""]
["00:51,740","00:55,240","\"Is the key in the trash can next to the phones?\""]
["00:55,240","00:59,440","\"What's this?\""]
["00:59,440","01:00,440","\"I don't know what's in it.\""]
["01:00,440","01:02,440","\"No.\""]
["01:02,440","01:03,640","\"What are you laughing at?\""]
["01:03,640","01:07,840","\"I'm picturing Donald Duck with like evil black goop dream out of his mouth.\""]
["01:07,840","01:10,840","\"Oh, you got the stuff?\""]
["01:10,840","01:13,240","\"Please tell me I got the stuff.\""]
["01:13,240","01:14,640","\"So you have it?\""]
["01:14,640","01:15,440","\"Yes.\""]
["01:15,440","01:17,440","\"You're a filthy liar.\""]
["01:17,440","01:19,640","\"Come back to me when you actually have it.\""]
["01:19,640","01:22,840","\"You shouldn't eat this stuff. It's dangerous. It controls your brain\""]
["01:22,840","01:27,160","\"From the hip movie the stuff exactly yes, so I talked to her\""]
["01:27,160","01:33,160","\"Do you want to know about Kerry talk to her brother? I don't I think it was a stop here\""]
["01:33,160","01:35,360","\"It was locked by a fancy gate\""]
["01:35,360","01:38,960","\"Mom says you needed some pretty bad have a nice house like the blah blah blah blah blah\""]
["01:38,960","01:42,360","\"So that was the house. Yeah, okay. How do we get in through it?\""]
["01:42,360","01:48,520","\"Talk to him because he's outside and probably will fight you fight me. It's a good point. Oh\""]
["01:49,040","01:51,040","\"Oh, he's a robust alcoholic.\""]
["01:51,040","01:53,040","\"You're looking for the Manshrew's house, huh?\""]
["01:53,040","01:56,000","\"Why did she give you a key to?\""]
["01:56,000","02:00,720","\"My wife says I need to get rid of the key if I ever want to see my daughter again. Why?\""]
["02:00,720","02:05,520","\"I don't know, but I'd rather die than let someone else see my beautiful leggy candy.\""]
["02:05,520","02:08,000","\"Hey, his wife doesn't like him fucking legs.\""]
["02:08,000","02:11,440","\"Okay, that's fair.\""]
["02:14,320","02:20,960","\"It's a very relaxing song isn't it to fight a robust alcoholic. I just feel kind of bad for the guy\""]
["02:20,960","02:25,960","\"He's having a good time\""]
["02:25,960","02:28,400","\"Oh fuck ah\""]
["02:28,400","02:35,160","\"Just fucking asshole fuck you. Who do you think you are some kind of alcoholic a robust alcoholic? Oh?\""]

["02:43,760","02:47,800","\"Jesus okay here we go\""]
["02:47,800","02:57,320","\"Was this to quiet eight oh\""]
["02:57,320","03:05,000","\"What I think you're supposed to press the button on each side when the boxing level is coming by that's really yeah\""]
["03:05,000","03:09,040","\"That's weird doesn't read so good. That wasn't in the game originally from what I remember\""]
["03:09,040","03:13,660","\"I would say at least you know to do that next time, but the way that these battles go\""]
["03:13,660","03:16,980","\"It's probably just never gonna happen again. I got no Schmelin Schalts\""]
["03:16,980","03:20,520","\"Maybe they'll recycle it for a different enemy or something later\""]
["03:20,520","03:24,420","\"I'll try to see you probably will do that cuz if you'll notice it was like a generic\""]
["03:24,420","03:29,440","\"Oh man, I forgot to use a stupid fucking panda. I just mean it's not gonna happen in this fight\""]
["03:29,440","03:33,720","\"I love you ginger hero\""]
["03:33,720","03:37,120","\"Okay\""]
["03:37,520","03:40,640","\"That is the greatest attack I've ever seen in a video game\""]
["03:40,640","03:46,980","\"Whoa, it took two. It's crazy. Can I do I like Michael's portrait right now?\""]
["03:46,980","03:52,280","\"You'll be freaking dead\""]
["03:52,280","03:56,300","\"Yes the best - this game rocks\""]
["03:56,300","04:00,560","\"Here we go\""]
["04:00,560","04:04,600","\"Does that all he's ever gonna do probably no the Panda\""]
["04:05,400","04:07,000","\"This is not good.\""]
["04:07,000","04:09,000","\"You don't have your panda anymore.\""]
["04:09,000","04:11,000","\"Yeah, look at that.\""]
["04:11,000","04:12,000","\"[MUSIC PLAYING]\""]
["04:12,000","04:14,400","\"That's all.\""]
["04:14,400","04:17,000","\"Oh, man, I might die.\""]
["04:17,000","04:17,500","\"See, I made a--\""]
["04:17,500","04:18,500","\"Just three toes.\""]
["04:18,500","04:19,300","\"You might get him.\""]
["04:19,300","04:20,400","\"I made a mistake here.\""]
["04:20,400","04:21,880","\"I thought you were supposed to go to his house\""]
["04:21,880","04:23,500","\"because she told you about his house,\""]
["04:23,500","04:25,600","\"but you were supposed to go to our random guy that had nothing\""]
["04:25,600","04:27,600","\"to do with his house to get a key for the house.\""]
["04:27,600","04:28,600","\"You're covered.\""]
["04:28,600","04:30,100","\"The tone isn't that big, at least.\""]
["04:30,100","04:31,100","\"No, it was always a matter of time.\""]
["04:31,100","04:33,300","\"It was easy to find him because he was just outside.\""]
["04:33,300","04:34,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:34,600","04:36,040","\"Okay, gotta get this.\""]
["04:36,040","04:38,140","\"- Do you think, in sense, it's intentional\""]
["04:38,140","04:40,180","\"that you reached this conclusion\""]
["04:40,180","04:42,740","\"by trying to think of it as a video game?\""]
["04:42,740","04:43,660","\"- Oh, come on.\""]
["04:43,660","04:45,520","\"- That you said, hey, he's outside,\""]
["04:45,520","04:46,820","\"he's probably gonna fight you.\""]
["04:46,820","04:49,020","\"- No, I don't think it was intentional whatsoever.\""]
["04:49,020","04:51,100","\"(laughs)\""]
["04:51,100","04:54,500","\"- Because this whole portion of the game anyways\""]
["04:54,500","04:55,660","\"feels very arbitrary.\""]
["04:55,660","04:56,500","\"- When you hear the name--\""]
["04:56,500","04:58,340","\"- It's just the idea of, okay, here's some fights,\""]
["04:58,340","04:59,740","\"we forgot, we need some.\""]
["04:59,740","05:02,180","\"- When you hear the name Postmodern RPG,\""]
["05:02,180","05:04,780","\"you would expect something like that.\""]
["05:04,780","05:07,880","\"You would be like, oh, it's gonna try to deconstruct\""]
["05:07,880","05:09,220","\"the idea. You also could name it.\""]
["05:09,220","05:11,460","\"Postmodern RPG to make people think\""]
["05:11,460","05:13,060","\"that all of this was calculated.\""]
["05:13,060","05:15,220","\"Yes, that is also true.\""]
["05:15,220","05:16,400","\"Fine, it'd be some sense.\""]
["05:16,400","05:18,220","\"Unlikely but true.\""]
["05:18,220","05:19,700","\"Turned to true. I don't think that's why\""]
["05:19,700","05:20,860","\"they would call it that.\""]
["05:20,860","05:26,380","\"To justify weird decisions using a word\""]
["05:26,380","05:30,020","\"that doesn't really mean what you think it means.\""]
["05:30,020","05:34,060","\"I imagine those, yeah, what the game was the camera for a bit.\""]
["05:34,060","05:37,980","\"I imagine those shadows look a lot better on the PC.\""]
["05:37,980","05:39,940","\"Oh yeah, it's a frame rate drive.\""]
["05:39,940","05:41,620","\"I don't like the pixel look.\""]
["05:41,620","05:42,620","\"I'm fine with it.\""]
["05:42,620","05:44,620","\"Yeah, it's actually not so bad.\""]
["05:44,620","05:47,380","\"Oh yeah, should I go drinking fountain first?\""]
["05:47,380","05:49,020","\"That's probably a good one.\""]
["05:49,020","05:50,020","\"Where is one?\""]
["05:50,020","05:51,020","\"The 7-11.\""]
["05:51,020","05:52,020","\"Yeah, top left.\""]
["05:52,020","05:53,020","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:53,020","05:56,020","\"It's not a 7-11 excuse you.\""]
["05:56,020","05:58,020","\"It's lucky 7.\""]
["05:58,020","05:59,020","\"Damn it.\""]
["05:59,020","06:00,020","\"Okay.\""]
["06:00,020","06:03,020","\"Thank you, video, Deb.\""]
["06:03,020","06:06,020","\"You're gonna go beat up that kid?\""]
["06:06,020","06:08,620","\"I want to, but I don't got time.\""]
["06:08,620","06:13,020","\"I mean, it only takes like seconds to do that to a kid.\""]
["06:13,020","06:14,020","\"Psht.\""]
["06:14,020","06:15,020","\"Hello, you're in!\""]
["06:15,020","06:16,020","\"I did it, though.\""]
["06:16,020","06:17,020","\"Not dream from as well.\""]
["06:17,020","06:18,020","\"Okay.\""]
["06:18,020","06:20,020","\"You're progressing in the game, and you didn't even have to look up a walkthrough.\""]
["06:20,020","06:23,020","\"Well, I know I'm very good at video games.\""]
["06:23,020","06:25,020","\"Everyone tells me quite a lot.\""]
["06:25,020","06:27,020","\"What is this?\""]
["06:27,020","06:28,020","\"Some kind of house.\""]
["06:28,020","06:30,220","\"I knock, but no one answered.\""]
["06:30,220","06:32,120","\"Perhaps I should try the side door.\""]
["06:32,120","06:33,820","\"That to me looks like the side door.\""]
["06:33,820","06:36,020","\"Yeah, what the hell?\""]
["06:36,020","06:40,920","\"I would assume that the door facing the street is the main door.\""]
["06:40,920","06:41,920","\"This is the place.\""]
["06:41,920","06:42,920","\"I guess.\""]
["06:42,920","06:46,320","\"No, do we just knock?\""]
["06:46,320","06:47,720","\"Let's give it a try.\""]
["06:47,720","06:48,720","\"Worse comes to worst.\""]
["06:48,720","06:50,320","\"She's sleeping and we wake him up.\""]
["06:50,320","06:53,360","\"She's so clever.\""]
["06:53,360","06:54,360","\"She thinks ahead.\""]
["06:54,360","06:56,200","\"Who are you guys?\""]
["06:56,200","07:02,200","\"I tapped my head, which not only is bad because viewers can't see it, but Chris can't see me either.\""]
["07:02,200","07:03,200","\"I come from the internet.\""]
["07:03,200","07:05,200","\"Oh, one sec.\""]
["07:05,200","07:06,200","\"He's like an alien.\""]
["07:06,200","07:07,200","\"Come in.\""]
["07:07,200","07:09,200","\"I would not invite them in.\""]
["07:09,200","07:10,200","\"What?\""]
["07:10,200","07:11,200","\"Why?\""]
["07:11,200","07:14,200","\"Hey, mom, a guy from the Internet showed up.\""]
["07:14,200","07:15,200","\"He put out an ad.\""]
["07:15,200","07:17,200","\"He was like, \"\"Hey, come investigate this.\"\"\""]
["07:17,200","07:19,200","\"We did that much out on your own.\""]
["07:19,200","07:22,200","\"If not, why would I be letting you into my room?\""]
["07:22,200","07:25,200","\"Anyway, what are your names?\""]
["07:25,200","07:27,800","\"I'm Alex. This is my Alex yeech\""]
["07:27,800","07:34,820","\"What are your screen names? That's how I know all of you so that would be more beneficial. Oh\""]
["07:34,820","07:38,840","\"Fuck off\""]
["07:38,840","07:45,240","\"I mean I was Odie Sephiroth. I mean, okay\""]
["07:45,240","07:48,000","\"The N64 was out already\""]
["07:48,000","07:55,040","\"Well, but wait a minute. I realized I was really fucking by the time I was like 50 and I asked Tom Folta change it\""]
["07:55,040","07:58,040","\"He legally had to change your screen.\""]
["07:58,040","08:01,040","\"Don't fall back to hacking rooms just to help me out.\""]
["08:01,040","08:05,040","\"You had to go into a digital courtroom to get your screen name changed.\""]
["08:05,040","08:06,040","\"In reality in his town.\""]
["08:06,040","08:09,040","\"I...\""]
["08:09,040","08:11,040","\"She is tiny by comparison.\""]
["08:11,040","08:13,040","\"Everything you read on the internet.\""]
["08:13,040","08:15,040","\"You boys take that stuff too seriously.\""]
["08:15,040","08:16,040","\"I believe everything I read.\""]
["08:16,040","08:18,040","\"Hey, I invented lying on the internet.\""]
["08:18,040","08:19,040","\"So no need to warn me.\""]
["08:19,040","08:21,040","\"Anyway, I'll have my eyes on you.\""]
["08:21,040","08:22,040","\"Why does he...\""]
["08:22,040","08:24,040","\"Why does he sound like this?\""]
["08:24,040","08:28,600","\"If you're ripping a hole in my basement with your mind powers or whatever the hell it is you do.\""]
["08:28,600","08:30,840","\"I am definitely a voice actor.\""]
["08:30,840","08:33,800","\"Why do you not like this guy's performance, Chris?\""]
["08:33,800","08:37,400","\"Well, one, he sounds like he's in a big medium-sized room.\""]
["08:37,400","08:38,240","\"That's a good point.\""]
["08:38,240","08:39,240","\"You do.\""]
["08:39,240","08:40,240","\"That's very fair.\""]
["08:40,240","08:41,240","\"You're the reaver pretty clearly.\""]
["08:41,240","08:44,120","\"No matter how you feel about the performance, audio quality is like an objective thing.\""]
["08:44,120","08:48,600","\"I don't mind the voice for the character because the character I think fits the voice.\""]
["08:48,600","08:49,600","\"Yeah, I would say.\""]
["08:49,600","08:50,600","\"Yeah, no, that's fair.\""]
["08:50,600","08:51,600","\"So, so...\""]
["08:51,600","08:53,600","\"I think you're supposed to think of it as well.\""]
["08:53,600","08:57,600","\"Because if it wasn't almost any other situation it would not work period\""]
["08:57,600","09:01,960","\"But yik is a special case because of who these characters are my sister\""]
["09:01,960","09:09,720","\"She vanished about three weeks ago. I went to school one day left school and it's the recording sounds horrible. That's it. I\""]
["09:09,720","09:12,600","\"Don't think he's going his eyes at you\""]
["09:12,600","09:16,480","\"Sorry, but your lines aren't compressed\""]
["09:16,480","09:23,120","\"It's fine if you have an issue with the performance - I think Ding Dong feels the same right what?\""]
["09:23,120","09:24,840","\"- That you're not, you feel like--\""]
["09:24,840","09:26,640","\"- I think it's 'cause he's not very good after.\""]
["09:26,640","09:27,480","\"- Is he?\""]
["09:27,480","09:28,320","\"- I think he is.\""]
["09:28,320","09:29,160","\"I don't know anything about him.\""]
["09:29,160","09:32,240","\"- Look, I'm not being mean, but the voice isn't calm.\""]
["09:32,240","09:33,560","\"- It doesn't sound compressed at all.\""]
["09:33,560","09:35,280","\"You have to compress you now.\""]
["09:35,280","09:37,040","\"- Now, do you think his hood was up originally?\""]
["09:37,040","09:39,360","\"- Show the viewer what we sound like, not compressed.\""]
["09:39,360","09:40,960","\"Hello, I am not compressed.\""]
["09:40,960","09:42,240","\"Hello, I am compressed.\""]
["09:42,240","09:43,840","\"It really helps you sound good.\""]
["09:43,840","09:45,240","\"That's about it.\""]
["09:45,240","09:47,000","\"- No crazy element of the video over either.\""]
["09:47,000","09:47,840","\"She's just not--\""]
["09:47,840","09:49,000","\"- I covered his face.\""]
["09:49,000","09:50,240","\"- Please stop talking about it.\""]
["09:50,240","09:52,280","\"- He said he brutally owned me.\""]
["09:52,280","09:55,180","\"I don't sound compressed\""]

["10:11,160","10:13,960","\"That seems like they enjoy her as a character\""]

["15:10,020","15:14,020","\"I am the expert on metaphysics.\""]

["15:17,520","15:19,020","\"She didn't mock him.\""]

["15:20,420","15:22,020","\"She usually does that to me.\""]

["15:39,400","15:43,640","\"I mean, bear in mind, aren't they supposed to be like, you know, mid 30s?\""]
["15:43,640","15:45,000","\"No, sorry, mid 20s.\""]
["15:45,000","15:46,080","\"It mid 50s.\""]

["15:59,760","16:00,800","\"We just in a big room.\""]

["16:04,760","16:07,760","\"He's on a big stage with a tiny microphone.\""]

["16:10,480","16:14,000","\"Sometimes it feels like my sister is still in her room upstairs.\""]

["16:22,440","16:23,520","\"OK, buddy.\""]
["16:23,520","16:27,240","\"Like in the same way I can feel my foot is attached to my leg without actually\""]

["18:27,400","18:28,200","\"That's a good point.\""]
["18:28,200","18:30,400","\"You probably can't get a few levels.\""]

["20:01,480","20:04,560","\"I would say there are areas of it.\""]
["20:04,560","20:09,080","\"We're definitely lacking most of it being in the writing, but it's like endearing in ways.\""]
["20:09,080","20:12,800","\"But I think the best thing about this game is the visuals and the atmosphere.\""]
["20:12,800","20:14,240","\"Yeah, the visuals are so short.\""]
["20:14,240","20:14,480","\"Interesting.\""]

["20:17,560","20:24,160","\"I think the story is worth following through on, but for somebody like me that like is really\""]

["20:50,880","20:53,880","\"Because it's in the same way that this does\""]

["21:16,640","21:18,240","\"- It's best for a movie, right?\""]
["21:18,240","21:21,600","\"That they interviewed the people that were in Troll 2,\""]
["21:21,600","21:23,880","\"and specifically the one guy is really proud\""]
["21:23,880","21:25,120","\"that he was in it.\""]
["21:25,120","21:26,400","\"- But he doesn't seem to understand\""]
["21:26,400","21:29,520","\"why people followed the movies.\""]
["21:29,520","21:32,400","\"And that was one of the parts is that he goes over\""]
["21:32,400","21:33,960","\"to some woman's house that they're willing to do.\""]
["21:33,960","21:35,440","\"- He understands, 'cause that's what he opens with.\""]
["21:35,440","21:38,600","\"He's always like, \"\"Hey, you ever hear Troll 2?\""]
["21:38,600","21:40,160","\"\"\"It's the worst movie ever made of it.\"\"\""]
["21:40,160","21:42,920","\"- Yeah, well, yes, but also no.\""]
["21:42,920","21:44,540","\"There's still a lacking of awareness,\""]
["21:44,540","21:46,000","\"and it only comes out at the end\""]
["21:46,000","21:47,800","\"when he goes to a comic con,\""]
["21:47,800","21:50,440","\"and he realizes, like he's looking at everybody else.\""]
["21:50,440","21:52,920","\"I mean, he's like, I don't know,\""]
["21:52,920","21:54,880","\"he's trying to piece it together still.\""]
["21:54,880","21:57,520","\"He's kind of insecure about what he's realizing,\""]
["21:57,520","21:58,720","\"because he's looking at everyone like,\""]
["21:58,720","22:01,600","\"this is all they have, that's all these people have.\""]
["22:01,600","22:03,280","\"They have nothing else going on.\""]
["22:03,280","22:05,880","\"They have one thing that they're known for.\""]
["22:05,880","22:07,120","\"- And then all of a sudden, he said,\""]

["22:10,920","22:12,600","\"- The best part of that whole documentary\""]
