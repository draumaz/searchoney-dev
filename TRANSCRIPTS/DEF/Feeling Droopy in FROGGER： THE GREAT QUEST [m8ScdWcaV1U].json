["13:34,700","13:36,600","\"- The classic same gameplay.\""]
["13:36,600","13:37,840","\"This is what Pac-Man was trying to do,\""]

["13:59,020","14:04,360","\"I beat that whole game and I was a kid and I still know pretty much everything you need to do by heart really\""]
["14:04,360","14:07,680","\"It's a game where you you actually have no control over Pac-Man\""]
["14:07,900","14:13,960","\"You literally just have to tell him what to do by pointing at stuff and firing a slingshot at things\""]
["14:13,960","14:18,520","\"Really and like his he'll refuse to like listen to you if he's in a bad mood\""]
["14:18,520","14:22,640","\"Like if he gets hurt dude, I just got the fucking honey and I found the bees\""]

["14:38,940","14:42,380","\"Oh God, oh my I\""]
["14:42,380","14:47,340","\"Well, I'm actually starting to remember where we are I've seen that Pac-Man game. It's like a weird\""]
["14:47,340","14:49,860","\"It's like a weird Windows 98 game\""]
["14:49,860","14:56,620","\"It feels like it but it's all but you're supposed to play on a controller even though it feels like it was designed to play with a mouse\""]
["14:56,620","14:58,620","\"Yeah, I\""]
["14:58,620","15:02,540","\"Would totally be down to play that on any plays. Okay, let's do it\""]

["15:19,460","15:25,260","\"For real gas so we wouldn't get stuck Adam. You could probably beat the entire game in three hours\""]
["15:25,260","15:31,340","\"We're back in town Adam. You want me to tell you what to do? Where's the Barrett? He's up. You gotta go up the stairs\""]
