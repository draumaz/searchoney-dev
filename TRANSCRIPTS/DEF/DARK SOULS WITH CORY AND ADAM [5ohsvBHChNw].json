["07:44,940","07:49,380","\"You don't want them to become undead because they have really interesting stories\""]

["09:18,300","09:22,280","\"Yeah, so but you really use humanity like if you want an item, right?\""]
["09:22,280","09:27,820","\"You pop a bunch of humanity and then your item discovery will go up and it'll help you do it\""]
["09:28,140","09:32,540","\"But the only problem is you get limited amounts until later on later on you get a bump\""]
["09:32,540","09:39,140","\"Well, you can farm at some point, but it's far in so you're kind of limited\""]
["09:39,140","09:42,140","\"and the thing is like\""]
["09:42,140","09:48,220","\"If you die that's really cool that like the wings opening and then carrying you away\""]

["10:21,180","10:28,060","\"I only saw the I gandalf. I think the most satisfying thing I've lived through was seeing the rings of power fail horribly\""]
["10:28,060","10:32,760","\"Yeah, they're deservingly so you can't make a sequel to a series like that\""]
["10:32,760","10:38,720","\"That actually made my dick smaller all of the testosterone that flowed into my body seeing that happen\""]
["10:38,720","10:43,920","\"How did you get it back up and pumping again? I didn't just did it. It's been deflated ever since\""]
