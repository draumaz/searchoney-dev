["09:01,500","09:04,260","\"Okay, that kind of kicks ass\""]
["09:04,260","09:12,100","\"It's long recharge though. See oh, but it's like it's like a holy bomb of electricity. It is\""]
["09:12,100","09:16,980","\"It's pretty cool, and it can't hurt you because you're immune to everything it does\""]
["09:17,700","09:20,420","\"Mmm, okay, if it's your choice\""]
["09:20,420","09:26,980","\"I think it's what if you kept one what if you kept the other one is a lightning wand - and you just like you don't actually need all four of\""]
["09:26,980","09:32,220","\"Them right can you put like the double or like the split cast on that - or no?\""]
["09:32,220","09:40,820","\"This one yeah double scatter with low accuracy. I mean, I don't think you need to because of that. I'm not sure how that works\""]

["10:11,900","10:16,660","\"Come on perks. Give me something juicy. Oh and always cast is that could be risky\""]
["10:16,660","10:21,560","\"But it can also be fucking amazing faster project tiles permanent shields pretty good\""]
["10:21,560","10:27,080","\"Could be good for this final you can do perm. You you have a chance. It's like more than one\""]
["10:27,080","10:32,740","\"You get permanent shield and then if you get another chance at something, okay\""]
