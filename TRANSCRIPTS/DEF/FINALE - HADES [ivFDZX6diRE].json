["01:35,460","01:40,420","\"Well, that's actually a terrible idea though because then that one will die like guaranteed right?\""]
["01:40,420","01:44,700","\"Like Harry Potter wasn't ageless. It's true having immortal horcrux is stupid\""]

["03:34,500","03:37,700","\">> Why don't they just put a magical black hole inside their butthole?\""]

["05:22,380","05:24,380","\"Herms but Herms.\""]
["05:24,380","05:29,580","\"Yeah, for all you know you could have gotten another like three dashes.\""]
["05:29,580","05:31,540","\"I don't think they ever give you the same one.\""]
["05:31,540","05:32,540","\"I think you're right.\""]
["05:32,540","05:35,260","\"I think you have to upgrade them to like do something like that.\""]
["05:35,260","05:36,260","\"I'm sure you're right.\""]
["05:36,260","05:37,260","\"Okay.\""]

["05:39,260","05:40,660","\"Yeah, it is super neat looking.\""]
["05:40,660","05:42,660","\"It's almost like Okami-ish.\""]
["05:42,660","05:44,260","\"Oh, how did they do it?\""]
["05:44,260","05:48,460","\"I wonder if the 3D modeler is just like a bunch of PNG suitcases.\""]
["05:48,460","05:50,300","\"Zacharyus is a model, right?\""]
["05:50,300","05:52,100","\"Yeah, he's gotta be.\""]
["05:52,100","05:54,740","\"If he's not, I'll fucking eat my own dick.\""]
["05:54,740","05:57,740","\"Alright, specialitz twice for the...\""]
["05:57,740","05:58,240","\"Mmm.\""]
["05:58,240","06:01,380","\"But no longer not, I suppose, whoa.\""]
["06:01,380","06:04,940","\"That would actually be really good.\""]
["06:04,940","06:08,540","\"Just because it makes my hits faster.\""]
["06:08,540","06:11,180","\"So I would heal faster.\""]
["06:11,180","06:12,540","\"I think I'm gonna maybe do it.\""]
["06:12,540","06:15,540","\"You can like infinite combo basically, right?\""]
["06:15,540","06:16,540","\"What do you mean?\""]
["06:16,540","06:17,540","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:17,540","06:21,180","\"Like, yeah, it'll just always keep striking as long as you hold down attack.\""]
["06:21,180","06:22,180","\"Oh, really?\""]
["06:22,180","06:23,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:23,180","06:24,180","\"Cool.\""]
["06:24,180","06:27,180","\"It kind of took my like third hit, which I think does a little bit more damage on the\""]
["06:27,180","06:29,740","\"sword, but I think it's probably worth it to...\""]
["06:29,740","06:31,700","\"It's worth it to have the like infinite chain.\""]
["06:31,700","06:33,700","\"Yeah, like the fast slash.\""]
["06:33,700","06:35,420","\"Oh, God.\""]
["06:35,420","06:38,580","\"So that's a power up where you can just hold down the attack button and just does it.\""]
["06:38,580","06:40,180","\"It's what he got from the hammer.\""]
["06:40,180","06:41,180","\"Cool.\""]
["06:41,180","06:45,740","\"We should have a hammer rocks my thumb was getting so fucking tired by the end of it\""]
["06:45,740","06:49,860","\"Each weapon is a completely different set of things that the hammer does for it to\""]
["06:49,860","06:56,940","\"Wow, yep, damn you're almost okay. These ones are cool because you get to oh\""]
["06:56,940","07:02,620","\"Yeah, but this room is gonna be like a pain in the ass so he'll have to choose one guy\""]
["07:02,620","07:08,100","\"And then it'll piss the other one. Yeah, I'm gonna choose Aphrodite because if I recall hers as a bitch to fucking dodge\""]
["07:08,940","07:13,540","\"Yeah, so now Dionys is gonna be attacking him with the next wave of enemies\""]
["07:13,540","07:19,660","\"He's gonna be in there. We could fix or more potent that one might be good\""]
["07:19,660","07:23,460","\"But that one would have been good if I got it earlier, but I'm just gonna go for this\""]
["07:23,460","07:35,660","\"Yeah, they get pissed off at you. So now now this chamber has like a bullshit thing going on\""]
["07:37,340","07:43,540","\"But that one telegraphs really easy after Didey's chases you around which is like why I didn't see all the places where\""]
["07:43,540","07:47,860","\"We're like there's the little pits. Yeah, that's Dionys is fucking with him. Oh\""]
["07:47,860","07:53,740","\"If he goes through those he'll get the drunken status, which is basically poison. Yeah, cool\""]
["07:53,740","07:58,820","\"I thought he was gonna come in and like fuck with you. Oh, no, no like it says\""]
["07:58,820","08:01,900","\"They're influences too weak for them to manifest down here\""]
["08:01,900","08:06,180","\"They don't even know like what your deal is or like what you're doing or they can't hear you\""]
["08:06,940","08:11,100","\"Okay, that's like a major plot thing and they did say it earlier, but\""]
["08:11,100","08:17,440","\"We were just too busy being thick heads apparently pretty much yeah, we were fucking coming everywhere\""]
["08:17,440","08:24,000","\"Yep screaming screaming and coming it seems like hitting that rapidly like you basically can tank these guys\""]
["08:24,000","08:29,540","\"Cuz you're getting health back at the same rate. They deal to him and yeah, this is potentially like a big bullshit build\""]
["08:29,540","08:30,740","\"Let's see\""]
["08:30,740","08:34,900","\"You take less damage from 40% or below that could be like a nice like\""]
["08:35,660","08:39,520","\"Backstop if anything actually does get dire. Okay. Yeah\""]
["08:39,520","08:46,380","\"Okay, you know what I'm gonna avoid that boss fight and just go fucking pay money to be good. Oh\""]
["08:46,380","08:50,180","\"So we meet again\""]
["08:50,180","08:55,480","\"Yeah, don't worry about it. Oh nice be nice to you again\""]
["08:55,480","09:02,440","\"Yeah, no he forgives you after you beat him. Yeah. Yeah in that very room. He was like, oh, okay\""]
["09:03,980","09:07,260","\"You know, I'm gonna take the fountain thing even though it's probably not that good\""]
["09:07,260","09:16,060","\"More health dude, or yeah, you know what or the Athena - I just already have some nice - I have a good - yeah you do\""]
["09:16,060","09:20,940","\"It's good for this room - yeah, these guys suck\""]
["09:20,940","09:26,260","\"Yeah, if they touch you they'll just instantly explode and do a lot of damage if I had a ranged weapon\""]
["09:26,260","09:31,900","\"They'd be nothing but like with the sword. They're a little bit hairy actually, you know what I heal myself\""]
["09:31,900","09:37,920","\"I'm willing to take a risk on this. Yeah, yeah get a hundred it'll give you enough to purchase something nice\""]
["09:37,920","09:45,600","\"Right before the boss lost a little bit of health, but nothing nothing really you're 77 gold richer. Oh, and you got\""]
["09:45,600","09:50,340","\"Yeah, I don't know that would have happened\""]
["09:50,340","09:52,380","\"Yeah\""]
["09:52,380","09:57,560","\"Like are they more likely to drop when you have that whatever ability that was I don't know\""]
["09:57,560","10:01,100","\"I don't know why that happened. I did not expect that to happen\""]
["10:01,100","10:05,100","\"Maybe there's always a chance you can get an item from it from those chests.\""]
["10:05,100","10:07,400","\"I've never seen that before.\""]
["10:07,400","10:08,400","\"Me neither.\""]
["10:08,400","10:09,800","\"Oh!\""]
["10:09,800","10:11,200","\"Big one.\""]
["10:11,200","10:12,900","\"They even cry like a real carriage.\""]
["10:12,900","10:18,800","\"Yeah, just try to get as much of your health back as you can.\""]
["10:18,800","10:19,800","\"There you go.\""]
["10:19,800","10:22,000","\"All right, this will give me health.\""]
["10:22,000","10:23,700","\"Ooh la la.\""]
["10:23,700","10:25,500","\"I'm fucking rocking this.\""]
["10:25,500","10:28,100","\"I think I might be able to go all the way.\""]
["10:28,100","10:30,000","\"Oh yeah, it's looking good.\""]
["10:30,100","10:32,900","\"Your liles actually not bad.\""]
["10:32,900","10:35,900","\"I've played a sad amount of this game.\""]
["10:35,900","10:45,700","\"I've never tried stripping all my shit off from the mirror and seeing how I did, but this is the closest thing so far to that.\""]
["10:45,700","10:46,500","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:46,500","10:53,900","\"I mean, like, after you beat it, you can do it with modifiers that make the game harder.\""]
["10:53,900","10:57,000","\"And it encourages you to do that.\""]
["10:57,000","11:04,120","\"So it gives you really good rewards for accepting the modifiers. You're doing excellent. You almost have a hundred you're about to\""]
["11:04,120","11:09,960","\"Over a hundred health. Yeah, like a normal amount of health and I heal from wackin. Yeah\""]
["11:09,960","11:15,540","\"I mean healing is like something that's kind of scarce especially like early into this game\""]
["11:15,540","11:23,000","\"It's kind of lucky that we all got that except for you Tomar. You kind of screwed yourself with it. Yeah, yeah, don't I know it?\""]
["11:23,000","11:26,640","\"Wow, look at you. You're such a big boy. Yeah\""]
["11:26,640","11:28,640","\"Yeah, and there's the shop.\""]
["11:28,640","11:30,340","\"And then it's Satan?\""]
["11:30,340","11:34,140","\"Yeah, then it's that fucking boss that everyone hates.\""]
["11:34,140","11:35,140","\"You mean you tour?\""]
["11:35,140","11:41,040","\"Come on, the battle rage isn't bad.\""]
["11:41,040","11:43,040","\"But remember, it's not going to help me in the boss fight.\""]
["11:43,040","11:44,940","\"The curse of vengeance would, I think,\""]
["11:44,940","11:46,640","\"would help you in the boss fight.\""]
["11:46,640","11:47,740","\"Yeah, you know what?\""]
["11:47,740","11:48,840","\"Sure.\""]
["11:48,840","11:52,440","\"All right, you're going to see how I fucking fight these bosses,\""]
["11:52,440","11:54,140","\"and it's probably not right.\""]
["11:54,140","12:00,460","\"Guys if you want to try my strategy of just focusing the Minotaur yeah, I don't just folk I try to do this\""]
["12:00,460","12:02,460","\"I try to like rope them together\""]
["12:02,460","12:06,640","\"and like that way at least when I like hit it hits both of them\""]
["12:06,640","12:10,260","\"But I don't know if that's the right way to do it necessarily\""]
["12:10,260","12:18,100","\"I think as long as you're hitting something your your healing factor is gonna work out\""]
["12:18,100","12:24,100","\"There he's jumping damn love yeah, I I know\""]
["12:24,100","12:26,100","\"I know what I'm doing to a certain extent.\""]
["12:26,100","12:28,020","\"- I'm glad I didn't block you, dude.\""]
["12:28,020","12:29,100","\"- Thanks, man.\""]
