["06:20,260","06:25,460","\"It's pretty similar. I want to try to parry him first try baby Matthew parry here. We go. I gotta kick him first\""]
["06:25,460","06:31,440","\"You know the first time I played this um I just watched that really cool intro with them\""]

["06:39,340","06:42,600","\"You know, it's like really slow and I like this is shit\""]
["06:42,600","06:47,520","\"But then when I got to the first boss and beat it I was like I feel like a fucking god right now\""]
["06:47,520","06:54,040","\"All right, well, let's give me the quick roll. I still got it's fat roll kick off the pants man. All right\""]

["07:37,140","07:41,340","\"I'm pretty sure certain things are worse just because it's the first of the series\""]
["07:41,340","07:47,140","\"Mmm, but and I'm sure there's still weapons that are crazy overpowered. Yeah, it works pretty good though. Oh\""]
["07:47,140","07:51,060","\"Come here girl. I\""]
["07:51,060","07:58,780","\"Actually like how these guys look to yeah, they look like monsters in the descent. I want to get another parry it felt real good. Oh\""]
["07:58,780","08:06,120","\"You're a good boy. Dude the combat feels so good, and this was like their first crack at it stupid\""]

["08:54,120","09:00,500","\"Uh I want to try to actually do this special parry move because I just keep hitting them with the R2 once I get the parry\""]
["09:00,500","09:02,500","\"Hmm once I get the Matthew parry\""]
["09:02,500","09:05,300","\"I love these guys breath sound listen to that\""]

["09:18,980","09:23,580","\"It stays in like one place. I'm pretty sure or it's not as exaggerated. I like that a lot though\""]
["09:23,580","09:26,920","\"Which in was a Dark Souls two or three they took away the rag doll\""]
["09:27,980","09:30,980","\"I think it might be two because I'm pretty sure it's in three\""]
["09:30,980","09:35,560","\"They can fling stuff around because you you can do it in Bloodborne. I kind of wish they just leave it alone\""]
["09:35,560","09:40,060","\"That's that's like a thing that objectively makes it look stupid, but it's hilarious and you know\""]
["09:40,060","09:43,480","\"You want it to be there. No one's gonna get mad about it. Oh nice try\""]
