["05:38,580","05:44,020","\"Yeah, I don't know how I feel about it honestly because this game does have cutscenes.\""]

["06:25,980","06:32,700","\"These are very common you're right. There is a character in the characters name start with R or G\""]
["06:32,700","06:38,100","\"There's a character in this game that lies about their name and then they reveal that their actual name\""]
["06:38,100","06:40,220","\"I'm not it's not a spoiler\""]
["06:40,220","06:47,300","\"They reveal their actual name is something else and I didn't even notice because they were so similar\""]

["07:39,300","07:40,780","\"We do.\""]
["07:40,780","07:42,340","\"We usually sit before things.\""]
["07:42,340","07:44,100","\"We stand before friendship.\""]
["07:44,100","07:45,700","\"We stand before money.\""]
["07:45,700","07:48,260","\"We stand before corruption.\""]

["08:02,200","08:04,700","\"Oh, we don't okay never mind\""]
["08:04,700","08:10,980","\"Yeah, would they really build you with an overly heavy build from the start they might just to fuck with you\""]
["08:10,980","08:14,220","\"This guy's the coolest. I forgot you can jump this is crazy\""]
["08:14,220","08:19,380","\"Tommenish finger. It's so weird because it feels like it's always been there to me\""]
["08:19,380","08:22,340","\"But then it hasn't\""]
["08:23,300","08:27,860","\"They also just change your flask button to square and it just seems like it's always been there\""]
["08:27,860","08:35,500","\"Not really. Yeah, it's usually triangle, right? Yeah. Oh wait. No, I think you are right. Yeah, actually yeah, you're right\""]
["08:35,500","08:38,220","\"Well, maybe I'm wrong. I don't know\""]
["08:38,220","08:43,360","\"It's the tree. I know I put it on triangle and Sekiro because it was fucking up on the D-pad\""]
["08:43,360","08:46,860","\"Pissed me off. I changed it\""]
["08:46,860","08:49,820","\"For the better\""]
["08:49,820","08:56,780","\"When I first played Demon Souls, I remember when I was first playing it you'd see like a spirit and a blood stain every now and again\""]
["08:56,780","08:59,260","\"but now it's like I\""]
["08:59,260","09:04,660","\"Feel like especially early on people are like jumping off cliffs and stuff to try to find secrets\""]
["09:04,660","09:11,660","\"Yeah, so I definitely I found a hallway where it's like nothing in this hallway could kill you and it had blood stains everywhere\""]
["09:11,660","09:14,560","\"But it had like kind of archways on the sides of it\""]
["09:14,560","09:21,460","\"So I assume what was happening was someone was jumping off repeatedly looking for weird secret holes and stuff\""]
["09:21,460","09:24,860","\"Makes sense because the game is pretty new. I love that you jump\""]
["09:24,860","09:31,400","\"Always makes it seem more fun. You could jump in the old ones, but it was kind of finicky. It was was awful\""]
["09:31,400","09:36,920","\"Yeah, remember didn't Dark Souls two or three of a thing where if you ran and you you clicked in like the left\""]
["09:36,920","09:43,360","\"Yeah, I thought that was better. That's better. Yeah, the first one you had to like run and jump with the same button\""]
["09:43,360","09:45,960","\"Yeah, and roll with the same button\""]
["09:45,960","09:48,360","\"Oh\""]
["09:48,360","09:55,360","\"The what have fun a grafted son is just a crab fuck you\""]
["09:55,360","10:01,920","\"Screamed you did screams you dead. I didn't even know that\""]
["10:01,920","10:07,760","\"Imagine getting screamed at by a crab\""]
["10:08,360","10:10,880","\"Imagine going to the hospital and having to explain\""]
["10:10,880","10:17,600","\"The nature of your injury after being screamed out by a crab would hit you well nothing, but I did get screamed\""]
["10:17,600","10:23,440","\"And she's like there's air it happens to the best of us\""]
["10:23,440","10:29,440","\"This guy really is the coolest. I don't think I would rely on him to save the world or whatever we're doing\""]
["10:29,440","10:35,200","\"Look at his hairy fingers. He does have little hairy fingers. He's a proper hobbit. He is\""]
["10:36,960","10:45,840","\"proper help it smell my fingers this this horny horse has taken an interest in you\""]
["10:45,840","10:52,840","\"don't worry Torren fortune is on his side he's very lucky to have died to the\""]

["11:00,560","11:05,640","\"ride them into this room at the beginning of ever recording the Elden ring\""]
["11:05,640","11:07,640","\"Why do they keep saying that?\""]
["11:07,640","11:10,640","\"Why do they think they know me like that?\""]
["11:10,640","11:12,640","\"The Golden Order.\""]
["11:12,640","11:16,640","\"She's been meaning to violate the Golden Order for some time now, I think.\""]
["11:16,640","11:20,640","\"She can violate my Golden Hole.\""]
["11:20,640","11:22,640","\"Mmm.\""]
["11:22,640","11:23,640","\"Lyle?\""]
["11:23,640","11:24,640","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:24,640","11:26,640","\"That was pretty cool of you.\""]
["11:26,640","11:27,640","\"Yeah.\""]
["11:27,640","11:30,640","\"When do you think they're going to do the inevitable Dark Souls movie, huh?\""]
["11:30,640","11:32,640","\"Do you think that's ever going to happen?\""]
["11:32,640","11:33,640","\"I don't think Dark Souls would work.\""]
["11:33,640","11:38,840","\"Oh, no, I think it'll happen and it's gonna suck. I think it would it could work as a movie\""]
["11:38,840","11:43,040","\"But yeah, they'll fuck it up. I think it might be like a Netflix show or something\""]
["11:43,040","11:47,660","\"But even then I don't know if it would you a ball against direct his first Netflix show\""]
["11:47,660","11:52,760","\"It's I thought he stopped. I thought that they like close that tax loophole and then he just quit\""]
["11:52,760","11:58,360","\"I I mean you're probably I hope you're right honestly, but should I go down here? It's up to you\""]
["11:58,360","12:03,040","\"That is the tutorial and I skipped it by accident. You can totally skip it if you'd like\""]
["12:03,040","12:07,480","\"Take the plunge! Take the plunge!\""]
["12:07,480","12:09,120","\"Do you want to plunge or not?\""]
["12:09,120","12:12,440","\"I remember I talked to this guy and I thought that my audio was broken because I think he's\""]
["12:12,440","12:15,960","\"the first time I've ever talked to a Dark Souls thing that didn't just speak.\""]
["12:15,960","12:18,760","\"Yeah, the ghosts don't speak.\""]
["12:18,760","12:19,760","\"Makes sense.\""]
["12:19,760","12:22,560","\"So it's basically just Dark Souls combat.\""]
["12:22,560","12:25,880","\"There's like one thing that's different, but okay, you could do the tutorial if you\""]
["12:25,880","12:26,880","\"want to.\""]
["12:26,880","12:28,360","\"Might as well.\""]
