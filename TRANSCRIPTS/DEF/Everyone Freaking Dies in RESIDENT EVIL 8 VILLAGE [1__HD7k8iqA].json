["01:47,220","01:47,700","\"Head on.\""]
["01:47,700","01:50,180","\"He's invincible.\""]

["02:04,740","02:06,740","\"Yeah, just get behind the wall\""]

["02:18,740","02:19,740","\"Oh, really?\""]
["02:19,740","02:22,740","\"Yeah, I assume it does something\""]
["02:22,740","02:26,900","\"Oh yeah, he can hit him while he's doing that thing.\""]
["02:26,900","02:31,980","\"That's probably your most legit strategy available.\""]
["02:31,980","02:34,740","\"Now that he's been charging and turning around faster.\""]
["02:34,740","02:35,740","\"Oh shit.\""]
["02:35,740","02:37,820","\"Oh god, is he blind?\""]
["02:37,820","02:38,980","\"Maybe weird question?\""]
["02:38,980","02:39,980","\"No.\""]
["02:39,980","02:42,580","\"I don't think he sees too great.\""]
["02:42,580","02:44,300","\"I can't imagine.\""]
["02:44,300","02:46,700","\"I don't see any eyes on the feller.\""]
["02:46,700","02:50,820","\"No, that feller is eyeless.\""]

["02:53,520","02:56,000","\"We're the fuck, okay.\""]
["02:56,000","02:58,160","\"- He's just ripping through everything now.\""]
["02:58,160","03:01,480","\"- I think he's legitimately lost in life.\""]
["03:01,480","03:04,140","\"It's kinda sad.\""]
["03:04,140","03:05,480","\"Where'd he go?\""]
["03:05,480","03:08,160","\"He is shockingly easy to lose.\""]
["03:08,160","03:10,040","\"- Yeah, he turns really fast now.\""]
["03:10,040","03:12,340","\"There you go.\""]
["03:12,340","03:14,760","\"Nice.\""]
["03:14,760","03:16,320","\"- I get him? - Yep.\""]
["03:16,320","03:17,160","\"- No, he's still going.\""]
["03:17,160","03:18,960","\"- I didn't get it just interrupted the attack.\""]
["03:18,960","03:20,760","\"- Oh, I had that counted somehow.\""]
["03:20,760","03:21,760","\"Oh, fuck!\""]
["03:21,760","03:24,160","\"Now stay down!\""]
["03:24,160","03:24,960","\"Oh!\""]
["03:24,960","03:26,760","\"Oh, that was his death out of me.\""]
["03:26,760","03:30,360","\"Yeah, he said his one liner, so that means this thing is definitively dead.\""]
["03:30,360","03:32,160","\"He wasn't even down when he said it.\""]
["03:32,160","03:34,560","\"He was up.\""]
["03:34,560","03:36,960","\"You got a complex mechanical heart loyal.\""]
["03:36,960","03:37,960","\"I know.\""]
["03:37,960","03:40,360","\"I'm kind of a nuanced character.\""]
["03:40,360","03:40,960","\"Harder, really.\""]
["03:40,960","03:42,760","\"Harder, really, too, but I still find you charming.\""]
["03:42,760","03:45,760","\"Yeah, by Act 3, I really turn it around.\""]
["03:45,760","03:48,560","\"Wait, is this backwards?\""]
["03:48,560","03:52,960","\"Oh, your whole worldview is backwards and yes, I am going the wrong way.\""]
["03:52,960","03:53,660","\"Oh.\""]
["03:53,660","03:57,760","\"I wish there was an evil resident to kill.\""]
["03:57,760","04:02,360","\"If only this residence was filled with evil.\""]
["04:02,360","04:06,160","\"And from that idea, resident evil was born.\""]
["04:06,160","04:08,560","\"I'm going to say that.\""]
["04:08,560","04:09,360","\"Oh, I do.\""]
["04:09,360","04:11,760","\"You're in his fucking office right now.\""]
["04:11,760","04:13,960","\"Miranda is a mama-able.\""]
["04:13,960","04:15,760","\"Her deceit knows no bound.\""]
["04:15,760","04:16,360","\"Is this the guy?\""]
["04:16,360","04:18,360","\"Oh, we're merely a bunch of fail.\""]
["04:18,360","04:19,360","\"This guy?\""]
["04:19,360","04:20,360","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:20,360","04:23,360","\"We're merely a bunch of failed kadoo experiments to her.\""]
["04:23,360","04:24,360","\"Kaya?\""]
["04:24,360","04:30,160","\"I was just lucky I had more affinity to the stuff than the other poor shmucks in the village.\""]
["04:30,160","04:32,200","\"She still calls me her son.\""]
["04:32,200","04:33,200","\"What a joke.\""]
["04:33,200","04:36,600","\"I'll never forgive her for what she did to me.\""]
["04:36,600","04:40,740","\"That crazy bitch has never been right in the head as she can't see a difference between\""]
["04:40,740","04:43,080","\"experiment and family.\""]
["04:43,080","04:44,680","\"Miranda didn't change my body.\""]
["04:44,680","04:46,280","\"She took my dignity.\""]
["04:46,280","04:50,120","\"If I didn't kill her, then my life would never be my own.\""]
["04:50,120","04:53,780","\"Still, she may be crazy, but she's also powerful.\""]
["04:53,780","04:57,200","\"She can turn into anyone using the Mega Mind Seat.\""]
["04:57,200","04:59,240","\"What I am not, I don't know how to say that.\""]
["04:59,240","05:00,240","\"Mega Biscuiti!\""]
["05:00,240","05:03,920","\"The trick to the spaghetti is that Brat Rose.\""]
["05:03,920","05:09,280","\"If I could access her power, then maybe, speaking of, the kid's dad, Ethan has a pretty interesting\""]

["05:10,280","05:11,280","\"Oh, thank you.\""]
["05:11,280","05:18,280","\"Maybe I could get him to help me out on this cold winter's night.\""]
["05:18,280","05:22,280","\"Um, where now would help be?\""]
["05:22,280","05:25,280","\"I kind of feel bad for the way I treated him.\""]
["05:25,280","05:28,280","\"I think he's just a little bit misunderstood.\""]
["05:28,280","05:29,280","\"Oh look.\""]
["05:29,280","05:32,280","\"Maybe he did sick a bunch of like man dogs on you.\""]
["05:32,280","05:34,280","\"Yeah, but who hasn't?\""]
["05:34,280","05:36,280","\"True.\""]
["05:36,280","05:40,720","\"All my friends I've made in the past three years of sick man dogs on me\""]
["05:40,720","05:46,520","\"Even after sicking the man dogs on you. I still would have taken him up on his offer. That's true\""]
["05:46,520","05:52,640","\"But was Ethan because obviously at that point he just respects you Ethan's not a smart man\""]
["05:52,640","05:55,800","\"But you got to give it to him. He is an idiot\""]
["05:55,800","06:01,560","\"I would buy the excuse though just being like she pretty much makes me do that if I don't then she kills me\""]
["06:01,560","06:04,200","\"Yeah, I mean that's kind of what he said to you\""]
["06:04,200","06:08,640","\"It was just like your daughter is a pickle and she could help and that even was like no\""]
["06:08,640","06:13,520","\"Don't help you it's not a pickle. It's not a helpful pickle\""]
["06:13,520","06:19,600","\"Daughters the most helpful pickle within a 500 mile radius\""]
["06:19,600","06:23,080","\"Like season three\""]

["07:19,920","07:26,160","\"Don't come oh\""]
["07:26,480","07:28,480","\"Oh, alright. He's telling you to just do no fat.\""]
["07:28,480","07:33,000","\"He literally is letting you live. He's like he's helping you pretty much.\""]

["07:35,620","07:37,960","\"fall, but\""]
["07:37,960","07:42,220","\"He was pretty polite about it. He didn't just try it right killing you. That's true\""]
["07:42,220","07:48,940","\"You know what as a monster he tried to reason with me at the start of the game Chris Redfield treating you like a dick\""]
["07:48,940","07:53,360","\"I'm pretty sure Ethan is just a dick. Yeah, I'm pretty sure yeah\""]
["07:54,360","07:57,560","\"- He asked for his wife to be murdered in front of him\""]
["07:57,560","07:58,720","\"when you think about it.\""]
["07:58,720","07:59,560","\"- I agree.\""]
["07:59,560","08:02,440","\"- He just never stands up for himself\""]
["08:02,440","08:04,560","\"so people just keep shitting on him.\""]
["08:04,560","08:06,040","\"And then when he does stand up for himself,\""]
["08:06,040","08:08,120","\"he stands up for himself a little too hard\""]
["08:08,120","08:10,280","\"where he kills the person.\""]
["08:10,280","08:14,880","\"So word doesn't get back like, hey, he's changed.\""]
["08:14,880","08:16,480","\"He stands up for himself now.\""]
