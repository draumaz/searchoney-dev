["00:05,000","00:07,000","\"Knuckles, Garden the Emerald.\""]
["00:07,000","00:08,000","\"Big Emerald.\""]
["00:08,000","00:09,000","\"Huh?\""]
["00:09,000","00:10,000","\"There he is.\""]
["00:10,000","00:15,600","\"He leans back on it and it falls off the mountain and slides down and gets stuck in an exhaust\""]
["00:15,600","00:17,600","\"pipe of a car driving by.\""]
["00:17,600","00:23,000","\"And it powers the car up so hard that it blasts into Sonic killing him instantly.\""]
["00:23,000","00:27,000","\"Now where's the parody element to it?\""]
["00:27,000","00:31,760","\"It's a parody in the same way that all those parodies are that Chris showed us last night.\""]
["00:31,760","00:32,760","\"Hello.\""]
["00:32,760","00:35,480","\"Then it's a parody because you referenced a thing that exists.\""]
["00:35,480","00:36,840","\"There's no actual joke.\""]
["00:36,840","00:37,840","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["00:37,840","00:39,360","\"Here's a pretty good parody.\""]
["00:39,360","00:45,920","\"Try just, you know, taking Sonic the Hedgehog 1 for the Sega Genesis and repackaging and\""]
["00:45,920","00:46,920","\"selling it.\""]
["00:46,920","00:48,200","\"Oh, but it's a parody.\""]
["00:48,200","00:50,960","\"But put text on it that says it's a parody.\""]
["00:50,960","00:54,720","\"Site the Fair Yousek on the back of the box and now it's your property.\""]
["00:54,720","00:56,240","\"Oh, it's our talks.\""]
["00:56,240","00:59,500","\"Look at him. He's a good girl. I wish he didn't have gloves\""]
["00:59,500","01:02,480","\"I wish it was just a heart with an eye. Aren't I cute?\""]
["01:02,480","01:07,100","\"I wish he was a heart and he had two little stick figure legs my heart can't talk and is cute\""]
["01:07,100","01:17,200","\"Sorry got a little thing stuck you got some nerve showing up like this. Can you just go away already?\""]
["01:17,200","01:21,640","\"Well, how could you say that's your heart? Have you gone mad?\""]
["01:21,640","01:24,160","\"Do you like some hard to mad rat?\""]
["01:24,160","01:26,160","\"rat\""]
["01:26,160","01:28,160","\"Am I gone dead?\""]
["01:28,160","01:30,160","\"You're a mad man\""]
["01:30,160","01:33,660","\"Julie what are those potions for?\""]
["01:33,660","01:35,660","\"I don't know. I don't work in pharmaceuticals.\""]
["01:35,660","01:38,660","\"That's rats serum. It turns you into a rat.\""]
["01:38,660","01:43,160","\"I like that they give you a little bit of time to get used to the beat.\""]
["01:43,160","01:45,160","\"Yeah, that's a good idea.\""]
["01:45,160","01:48,160","\"I can't believe Hearts Beat was written by that guy.\""]
["01:48,160","01:49,160","\"By Esauw.\""]
["01:49,160","01:50,160","\"After all he's done.\""]
["01:50,160","01:51,160","\"He's done.\""]
["01:51,160","01:53,160","\"He's still got it.\""]
["01:53,160","01:57,400","\"Do you like foreground elements?\""]
["01:57,400","01:58,400","\"Like foreground.\""]
["01:58,400","02:00,040","\"That obscure your vision.\""]
["02:00,040","02:01,120","\"I do actually.\""]
["02:01,120","02:06,200","\"I recognize why it's a bad idea in terms of game design, but I like...\""]
["02:06,200","02:07,200","\"You can make it work.\""]
["02:07,200","02:11,520","\"I like that it gives you a bit of challenge and that it's like, \"\"Oh, you better be paying\""]
["02:11,520","02:15,000","\"attention to what you're doing.\"\"\""]
["02:15,000","02:23,600","\"And I like that it also makes the world feel more like immersive to have to use an internet\""]
["02:23,600","02:26,160","\"like game talk term.\""]
["02:26,160","02:29,120","\"Do you feel immersed right now?\""]
["02:29,120","02:33,720","\"This little rat talking about immersed as Julie.\""]
["02:33,720","02:37,280","\"If we take out the gameplay that way no one will make a mistake.\""]
["02:37,280","02:41,120","\"It's a really good game design philosophy.\""]
["02:41,120","02:42,360","\"Thank you.\""]
["02:42,360","02:44,240","\"I did a whole video on it.\""]
["02:44,240","02:47,400","\"I would like them to make more games like this where you're just doing shit to the beat.\""]
["02:47,400","02:52,040","\"I mean, there's also a Necro dancer, which I think kind of kick that off.\""]
["02:52,040","02:54,680","\"Yeah, they're very similar in terms of that.\""]
["02:54,680","02:56,720","\"I tried Necro dancer and I couldn't get into it.\""]
["02:56,720","03:02,380","\"My thing with it is I want a little bit more than just do like actions to the beat,\""]
["03:02,380","03:05,680","\"because if you took out the beat element, it's just kind of a standard game plan.\""]
["03:05,680","03:10,860","\"I'd hope some things could also be properly timed to the music, visual cues, little things.\""]
["03:10,860","03:12,720","\"I would like the mechanics.\""]
["03:12,720","03:14,080","\"You know Revenge of Shinobi.\""]
["03:14,080","03:18,720","\"Mm-hmm. I wish you could time everything to the beat in that game that game's gotten such fun music\""]
["03:18,720","03:24,240","\"Sega Genesis in general. I really like audio on it when we take full advantage of it\""]
["03:24,240","03:29,360","\"There's a really pretty tracks. Did you see the guy in YouTube who took a bunch of Sega Genesis?\""]
["03:29,360","03:32,840","\"I don't know. Maybe he only took one actually, but he made it into a giant synth\""]
["03:32,840","03:37,680","\"It's cool. Yeah, that's good. There's so many musical options\""]
["03:37,680","03:43,360","\"Making use of game consoles. Yeah, that a really nice crispy. Yeah, that's a thing\""]
["03:43,360","03:48,480","\"It's really clear. If you listen to like the earthworm Jim soundtrack for example\""]
["03:48,480","03:54,400","\"The drum samples are super crisp on the Genesis by comparison everything was somehow god. I loved being a kid\""]
["03:54,400","03:57,120","\"playing my chiaga. What else did you do?\""]
["03:57,120","03:59,760","\"I drew a lot of pictures of like\""]
["03:59,760","04:02,960","\"Beheaded and stuff\""]
["04:02,960","04:06,680","\"Yeah, I was a problem child. I'll admit it\""]
["04:06,680","04:12,400","\"Did you ever get in trouble for like drawing violent things no in fact ever find your animations?\""]
["04:12,560","04:19,440","\"No, it's to drop violent things and everyone be like that rocks and they literally I'd have like kids and their parents being like\""]
["04:19,440","04:23,280","\"You know, it's one of the most spending I called him by the principal and they said okay Christopher\""]
["04:23,280","04:27,380","\"No, no, but you're not you're not drawing enough violence\""]
["04:27,380","04:34,200","\"Nobody gave a shit was really weird this comic you did where this man's head gets exploded after getting hit in the balls\""]
["04:34,200","04:40,680","\"This is really good stuff. I think I'm my son. I need you to do something for me. My son. It's been a real piece of shit\""]
["04:42,040","04:46,720","\"He's gonna come up with something really elaborate. Have you been ever contracted like that?\""]
["04:46,720","04:53,120","\"Not in a long time that's my knowledge. Yeah, I don't remember\""]
["04:53,120","04:58,800","\"Ask me things about my childhood and I'll see if I can remember anything. Did you ever get hit by a car?\""]
["04:58,800","05:01,840","\"Did you ever die? Did you ever get hit by a bike?\""]
["05:01,840","05:04,680","\"No, did you ever get hit by\""]
["05:05,200","05:11,920","\"Um an animal moving at a reasonably fast pace. Yes a dog fucking like destroyed me one time\""]
["05:11,920","05:16,520","\"I was at my friend's house and his dog ran into my lower legs and just fucking like trashed me into the ground\""]
["05:16,520","05:21,960","\"It wasn't even a big dog either. He was just going at like it's just a little tiny one. He's going at a hundred miles an hour\""]
["05:21,960","05:29,400","\"Back into it a lot of little jetpack on you didn't notice. I remember being really mad that everyone was laughing and not helping\""]
["05:32,240","05:39,040","\"Yeah, nothing's funnier than seeing a kid get wiped out except maybe seeing a big giant child getting wiped out by me\""]
["05:39,040","05:43,160","\"Or it's like 50 using a grow ray gun on a child making them larger\""]
["05:43,160","05:45,160","\"So then you can push them down and they fall hard good\""]
["05:45,160","05:48,680","\"Nothing beats that\""]
["05:48,680","05:55,920","\"The shrink ray I hate the human who used me wait this is just the last of us - this is all about revenge\""]

["06:27,940","06:34,240","\"They're cute. Yeah, I like their dopey faces. They're all used in abuse for experiments\""]
["06:34,240","06:39,240","\"They seem all right. You're gonna make them your comp. It is like they're having a good time. You can do that\""]
["06:39,240","06:42,480","\"We're gonna try. Hey, can you hear me or not?\""]

["08:40,760","08:42,960","\"You shouldn't go outside.\""]
["08:42,960","08:45,640","\"Going to a dangerous place and dying.\""]

["09:06,960","09:09,400","\"It's fine, killing the human as my wish.\""]
["09:09,400","09:12,160","\"I can't do it all by myself.\""]
["09:12,160","09:13,760","\"Listen up, all of you.\""]
["09:13,760","09:17,860","\"I'm not like you pieces are trash. I'm gonna kill him and get out of this wretched place\""]
["09:17,860","09:24,920","\"You can all stay here and be used by that stupid human until you die even I guess I is just being kind of like half-o\""]
["09:24,920","09:29,160","\"Yeah, he's got really good expressions. I love this character\""]
["09:29,160","09:35,020","\"Should told them I feel great. I don't need losers like them\""]
["09:35,020","09:40,680","\"Shrugs, what do you think of this game so far Chris? It's fun. Isn't it? I like the story, too\""]
["09:41,240","09:43,240","\"It's very\""]
["09:43,240","09:51,500","\"This is the every story where a guy's trying to warn everybody and it's always too late because everyone's a lazy fat piece of shit\""]
["09:51,500","09:57,040","\"I'm like me who knows that does everything it is right about everything\""]
["09:57,040","10:01,280","\"Pretty good so I'm guessing this is an indie game, right?\""]
["10:01,280","10:08,440","\"Actually, I know it's published by yeah, it's like distributed by yeah\""]
["10:09,200","10:13,420","\"But I don't know who made it. Yeah, it was like an indie game, but it's really good. I\""]
["10:13,420","10:16,220","\"Hope they get to do a follow-up\""]
["10:16,220","10:21,740","\"Cuz there are still the problems. Yeah, it's still very sloppy in a lot of ways, but it's a really good start\""]
["10:21,740","10:27,780","\"It's a good concept. I like the music a lot. I like the art style. I like this story the backgrounds are really beautiful\""]
["10:27,780","10:32,800","\"Does it real? Oh, this is a real place now. I see\""]
["10:32,800","10:38,960","\"Making pipes is the easiest thing to do in 3d. I was hoping you're gonna say in real life that too\""]
["10:38,960","10:41,960","\"You simply buy a pipe factory and make them.\""]
["10:41,960","10:45,960","\"Making your own sewer system is very easy.\""]
["10:45,960","10:47,960","\"It's just people don't try to do it too often.\""]
["10:47,960","10:53,960","\"Chris, by any chance did you ever play a game called Skitsou frenzy\""]
["10:53,960","10:56,960","\"on the Adult Swim website?\""]
["10:56,960","10:59,960","\"This game reminds me of it a lot.\""]
["10:59,960","11:06,960","\"It's like a platformer where you have to avoid hallucination creatures.\""]
["11:06,960","11:12,800","\"creatures. That's cool. I was just curious. No, I never heard of it. Adult swim somehow\""]
["11:12,800","11:17,520","\"makes a lot of really good games. I do. I always think about it. It's not specifically\""]
["11:17,520","11:20,940","\"adults. Well, obviously makes them. They just like they fund people who know what they're\""]
["11:20,940","11:25,060","\"doing. They find good people. I remember there was one on their website way back called\""]
["11:25,060","11:31,360","\"House of Dead Ninjas. I couldn't stop playing. No, fuck. I love rain world. I love cream\""]
["11:31,360","11:34,860","\"wolf. I was wondering if you were going to bring up cream wolf. That seems like the\""]

["11:41,860","11:47,260","\"Yeah, I saw so oh my god. I fucking hated it. Have you surprised?\""]
["11:47,260","11:53,940","\"Yeah, it looked really it looked really banal to me. No, but here's the thing. They got the analyst the very beginning\""]
["11:53,940","11:56,260","\"I was like this is actually really good\""]
["11:56,260","12:01,160","\"That's a very consistent reaction that I get from Disney movies especially Pixar I\""]
["12:01,160","12:07,620","\"I'm start out the movie being like oh shit. This is brilliant and then like by the end like you ruined it\""]
["12:07,740","12:12,180","\"No, you know like when I saw the ads I was like that looks so fucking bad\""]
["12:12,180","12:16,940","\"And then I saw like the first 10 minutes where he's talking about like playing piano and he's like\""]
["12:16,940","12:20,860","\"You know talking about how much he loves paying playing piano and you're like oh this guy's pretty pretty good\""]
["12:20,860","12:22,860","\"I like this guy and then\""]
["12:22,860","12:28,620","\"You know the whole premise and shit right? Yeah, I haven't seen it, but I I know and I can guess what it is\""]
["12:28,620","12:30,620","\"Okay, so he dies right?\""]
["12:30,620","12:35,620","\"I know he has that cute little sidekick character and my guess is oh, there's some kind of conflict about oh\""]
["12:35,620","12:41,560","\"Oh, they they still he wants to be alive again and they switch bodies. Yes. It's the most predictable shit\""]
["12:41,560","12:45,780","\"Yeah, but the worst part is is that they both get back to earth, right?\""]
["12:45,780","12:48,500","\"And he's he's just in the body of the cat for the rest of the film\""]
["12:48,500","12:53,380","\"It's like oh so this is gonna be a guy in a cat now the movie cool fucking love it\""]
["12:53,380","12:59,300","\"Anything that wasn't him in the cat's body was actually pretty good. Is that actually what happens is a cat for half the movie?\""]
["12:59,300","13:02,860","\"Yeah, it's like so annoying. It's like I don't fucking care\""]
["13:03,220","13:09,660","\"That's not the that's not what had me invested what had me invested was like the rest of the story does he still play piano as a cat?\""]
["13:09,660","13:10,500","\"No\""]
["13:10,500","13:12,000","\"Posted to the internet\""]
["13:12,000","13:15,220","\"That would have been a good joke actually\""]
["13:15,220","13:21,580","\"I just get really frustrated watching movies where the characters are just acting ridiculous for no fucking reason and no\""]
["13:21,580","13:25,900","\"For the convenience of the yeah for the convenience exactly. It's like okay fucking come on\""]
["13:25,900","13:31,860","\"But whatever it did look very beautiful at points. I'm sure it did\""]
["13:31,860","13:37,200","\"I mean Disney movies are always gonna look nice. Yeah, I think it would have been better as like a 30-minute film\""]
["13:37,200","13:41,540","\"Like a short movie no one's ever gonna do those now are they I?\""]
["13:41,540","13:44,580","\"Miss shorts. I do too. I like shorts a lot\""]
["13:44,580","13:48,940","\"That's the whole point of them is you don't have to like spend time building up all this extra shit\""]
["13:48,940","13:54,740","\"Just to pad out the time. It's also an environment where people with like lots of a budget can still work and make something\""]
["13:54,740","13:59,480","\"More concise storytelling plus it's a good area for experimentation to\""]
["14:00,100","14:03,700","\"different visual styles at least the cat was one of those like\""]
["14:03,700","14:07,920","\"Fat stupid looking cats which kind\""]
["14:07,920","14:13,200","\"It's just that every time I see a cat in something. It's always just a really cute cat\""]
["14:13,200","14:15,220","\"This was a really fat ugly cat\""]
["14:15,220","14:20,640","\"Because it's supposed to be I'm sure I'm sure like oh, it's isn't it embarrassing that he's in the body of a cat\""]

["17:55,700","17:56,700","\"Cool.\""]
["17:56,700","17:59,780","\"I think whoever came up with this might be sick of the mind, you know?\""]
["17:59,780","18:02,340","\"Real messed up.\""]
["18:02,340","18:05,180","\"I am actually a little surprised.\""]
["18:05,180","18:06,180","\"What?\""]
["18:06,180","18:08,020","\"That's like as violent as it is.\""]
["18:08,020","18:11,820","\"As a Japanese game too, they don't seem to like to do this kind of stuff.\""]
["18:11,820","18:13,220","\"It's all very heavily stylized as well.\""]
["18:13,220","18:14,220","\"It's just Japanese.\""]
["18:14,220","18:15,220","\"Yes.\""]
["18:15,220","18:17,180","\"But there's some stuff in here later on.\""]
["18:17,180","18:19,620","\"I think of like the rat king designing everything.\""]
["18:19,620","18:22,020","\"It's very grotesque, yeah.\""]
["18:22,020","18:24,700","\"They do some neat stuff.\""]
["18:24,700","18:25,200","\"Fuck, no.\""]
["18:25,200","18:27,100","\"It's very stylish.\""]
["18:27,100","18:27,900","\"That is too.\""]
["18:27,900","18:29,260","\"What are you going to do?\""]
["18:29,260","18:30,580","\"What do you think that smells like?\""]
["18:30,580","18:32,060","\"Those puddles?\""]
["18:32,060","18:33,300","\"Not good.\""]
["18:33,300","18:33,800","\"You think?\""]
["18:33,800","18:35,740","\"I had a hamster as a kid and got there.\""]
["18:35,740","18:37,060","\"And his brain exploded.\""]
["18:37,060","18:38,300","\"He had pins in his brain.\""]
["18:38,300","18:39,780","\"I don't know how they got there.\""]
["18:39,780","18:41,020","\"Then his brain exploded.\""]
["18:41,020","18:43,500","\"I sniffed it up.\""]
["18:43,500","18:45,380","\"That's why you're the way you are today, Chris.\""]
["18:45,380","18:47,620","\"Oh, fuck you.\""]
["18:47,620","18:49,100","\"You got punished for signing that up?\""]
["18:49,100","18:50,100","\"Yeah.\""]
["18:50,100","18:57,500","\"Oh, I hope there can be more and more and more rhythm games in the future.\""]
["18:57,500","18:58,500","\"I know, right?\""]
["18:58,500","19:00,820","\"I love rhythm games.\""]
["19:00,820","19:01,820","\"Probably my favorite.\""]
["19:01,820","19:02,820","\"What'd you say?\""]
["19:02,820","19:03,820","\"Yeah.\""]
["19:03,820","19:06,620","\"I would say they're probably one of my favorites doing.\""]
["19:06,620","19:09,180","\"I waited too long.\""]
["19:09,180","19:13,500","\"Rhythm games are my favorite too, but I don't play them very much because I would never\""]
["19:13,500","19:15,140","\"make one because it would be too hard.\""]
["19:15,140","19:17,860","\"As you can see, I'm not very good at them at all.\""]
["19:17,860","19:21,460","\"You wouldn't have a good time figuring out situations that you could like break down\""]
["19:21,460","19:26,780","\"song composition and sync visuals up to it, like tie mechanics to it.\""]
["19:26,780","19:28,580","\"Um, I could do that.\""]
["19:28,580","19:35,100","\"My problem would be like coming up with good like, I guess ideas per song, like visually\""]
["19:35,100","19:36,740","\"and like- You do something like this.\""]
["19:36,740","19:39,180","\"These guys are synchronized dancing right now.\""]
["19:39,180","19:40,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["19:40,180","19:42,220","\"I bet you could come up with something.\""]
["19:42,220","19:43,220","\"I'm sure it could.\""]
["19:43,220","19:45,180","\"It's just like right now I wouldn't really be able to.\""]
["19:45,180","19:48,300","\"You'd have to get into that mindset, keep challenging yourself.\""]
["19:48,300","19:51,780","\"I'm glad stuff like this exists that people are experimenting more with it.\""]
["19:51,780","19:54,260","\"What you can get out of something like a rhythm game.\""]
["19:54,260","19:56,180","\"No straight roads do a lot of that too.\""]
["19:56,180","19:59,980","\"It's neat that people are trying to figure out more with rhythm games.\""]
["19:59,980","20:04,780","\"It's a genre that I think everybody kind of missed to some extent too.\""]
["20:04,780","20:07,180","\"Because you only really had guitar here on rock band for a while.\""]
["20:07,180","20:10,380","\"Like there was an oversaturated marketplace which kind of got people out.\""]
["20:10,380","20:10,880","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:10,880","20:13,180","\"But I think that's just because people weren't seeing the other games\""]
["20:13,180","20:14,980","\"that also were popping up at the time.\""]
["20:14,980","20:19,060","\"People getting more creative than just that name some rhythm games you enjoy\""]
["20:19,060","20:25,500","\"Guitar room man is pretty good. Oh, that's one of my favorites. It's a shame that it's like wasn't it only on PS2\""]
["20:25,500","20:30,980","\"There's a PSP port that actually adds some new stuff to it and it plays a little bit better, but like yeah\""]
["20:30,980","20:32,980","\"That was a plate. I\""]
["20:32,980","20:38,140","\"Mean yeah, that's that was it. It was a PS2 release and it was on PSP and I was it that sucks\""]
["20:38,140","20:44,780","\"They need to like really they were really certain things on the PS5 like there was that Kickstarter for that rap rabbit game\""]
["20:44,780","20:50,200","\"that they were gonna do but it didn't get funded. I love Parappa. I was playing\""]
["20:50,200","20:54,360","\"Parappa 2 again recently. Parappa 2 I like it better. Yeah I think it's really\""]
["20:54,360","20:59,560","\"good it's got really good music and the system they figured out for freestyle\""]
["20:59,560","21:04,080","\"like it got a lot better the way that it works. What's your name? What's your name?\""]
["21:04,080","21:08,840","\"Pho. Did you ever understand how to get into cool when you were playing it?\""]
["21:08,840","21:12,640","\"Get into cool. Like the cool mode that they have so you just freestyle. I don't\""]
["21:12,640","21:18,140","\"remember they the first game you seriously could just like button mash to do it and\""]
["21:18,140","21:21,480","\"parappa 2 finally came up with a good rule so yeah we could play it if you want\""]
["21:21,480","21:27,540","\"pull the letter or whatever right now right now it's your favorite is my favorite song\""]
["21:27,540","21:33,640","\"okay cuz I think he's one of my favorites I like him a lot Julian who is yours you\""]
["21:33,640","21:38,880","\"like beard burgers right I do like beard I love that yeah I mentioned it when we\""]
["21:38,880","21:43,760","\"playing eat how does the beard burger one go again it tells you to French the\""]
["21:43,760","21:47,240","\"fries oh yeah fries the fries it pins a\""]
["21:47,240","21:55,840","\"face down the baddies I love that game I only played it for the first time when\""]
["21:55,840","22:01,560","\"I was like 22 really yeah but I got it as a kid I was so happy it's a lot of fun\""]
["22:01,560","22:05,400","\"I went back to parappa one after parappa two and I'm like oh parappa two's better\""]
["22:05,400","22:11,840","\"It's so good that I don't even know how to describe like the writing and comedy in a two because it's all very weird\""]
["22:11,840","22:14,960","\"Yeah, but it's all like still really entertaining to I\""]
["22:14,960","22:20,160","\"Consider it awkward if not for the fact that visuals are so like janky and stupid it makes it work\""]
["22:20,160","22:23,800","\"No, everything there it ends up working like nothing feels too off about it\""]
["22:23,800","22:30,840","\"It's unusual and there's fresh and they're so good that they use and like some of the dialogue - their voices are all perfect - I\""]

["22:33,600","22:35,600","\"Do you remember what\""]
["22:35,600","22:38,300","\"Was his name Colonel noodle?\""]
["22:38,300","22:44,260","\"What was the phrase he said like he slightly got it wrong and that's the kind of thing I expect from writing in parappa is that\""]
["22:44,260","22:47,660","\"Dialogue is always like kind of slightly off in a way\""]
["22:47,660","22:52,460","\"You understand what the characters are saying but they'll like use a phrase incorrectly\""]
["22:52,460","22:56,740","\"It's always something like that, but it adds to it. It makes it like more entertaining\""]
["22:57,580","23:01,500","\"Prep it's who's a lot of fun to play through and the two player mode's pretty fun, too\""]
["23:01,500","23:06,860","\"Like there's a there's a lot of neat stuff in that game never tried it. Did you ever unlock the different hats?\""]
["23:06,860","23:11,100","\"Nope, I feel like an idiot. I only found out recently that there was a\""]
["23:11,100","23:16,100","\"There was an additional difficulty. I never got to play as a kid because you have to put in the code to do it\""]
["23:16,100","23:21,200","\"But it's neat. It's neat that you get to go back and play the stages again and they get to be remixed\""]
["23:21,200","23:26,060","\"Lammy had co-op, which was pretty fun uber jammer. Mm-hmm\""]
["23:26,780","23:28,780","\"Is she kind of a hot babe?\""]
["23:28,780","23:33,780","\"No, she works at uber now. That's where she goes. She gets people Uber rides and make a little bit\""]
["23:33,780","23:35,780","\"Would you would you win a game?\""]
["23:35,780","23:42,780","\"What are other good rhythm games? I like be money games a lot. I like a dance dance revolution. I like beat mania\""]
["23:42,780","23:44,780","\"I like popin music\""]
["23:44,780","23:52,280","\"Where are some of your favorite rhythm games you lose guitar man for sure? Yeah guitar man's a really good one space channel 5\""]
["23:52,280","23:56,200","\"Sweet channel finds a lot of fun. I don't know. I didn't think of that because yeah part 2 is really good\""]
["23:56,200","24:01,560","\"I know there's space channel 5 VR now, but I still haven't gotten to try it\""]
["24:01,560","24:08,920","\"I guess part of the reason I could understand rhythm games not being so prevalent right now is because also latency latency\""]
["24:08,920","24:12,040","\"Yeah, yeah, it's just TVs most TVs can't yeah\""]
["24:12,040","24:17,380","\"TV is combined with even some of these new systems the switch has some issues with latency on a lot of games\""]
["24:17,380","24:22,360","\"It's amazing. They haven't like sorted that out. I remember when I was 13. I was like their biggest fanboy\""]
["24:23,920","24:26,280","\"Like it was when they were struggling and they were\""]
["24:26,280","24:31,580","\"Remember it kind of seemed like they were gonna die for a while like well the game cube was up because kind of\""]
["24:31,580","24:35,120","\"It pulled me out a lot because I actually liked the game people out when I was younger\""]
["24:35,120","24:39,720","\"No one I was younger though because the game people was failing. I was like it's fucking awesome\""]
["24:39,720","24:41,080","\"Why is nobody playing it?\""]
["24:41,080","24:46,740","\"I it's so weird to look back on because I bet people don't even remember at this point when you think of Wind Waker\""]
["24:46,740","24:50,320","\"For example people compliment that game now. Yeah back. No, but people low\""]
["24:50,320","24:53,800","\"Furious back then I can't believe that because\""]
["24:53,800","24:59,840","\"Forget which magazine it was but I remember the cover showed Wind Waker link it showed Mario Sunshine showed Metfreude Prime\""]
["24:59,840","25:04,320","\"And it was the big thing where it was kind of complaining like what are all these new decisions?\""]
["25:04,320","25:09,820","\"Nintendo's doing these are weird legend of Zelda more like legend of Zelda. What the heck?\""]
["25:09,820","25:15,740","\"That was literally yeah, that was people were calling it. They were they were mad about it. I loved that\""]
["25:15,740","25:21,040","\"It was still do I love Wind Waker. It's probably got some of the most personality out of any Zelda game\""]
["25:21,040","25:24,700","\"I really love that universe and its art style even though it's like not\""]
["25:24,700","25:31,500","\"Perfect I think it's my favorite just because of like the sense of adventure and yeah, I don't know\""]
["25:31,500","25:32,400","\"it's\""]
["25:32,400","25:36,140","\"the way everything like moves around like everything has a little bit of like\""]
["25:36,140","25:42,400","\"Secondary motion like his hat and his clothes and the other characters things like just look around yeah\""]
["25:42,400","25:45,600","\"I'll have little things with the space feels like living and breathing somehow\""]
["25:45,600","25:52,160","\"It was a really clever idea because it's also by stylizing it like that it gets to hold up even now looking back at the game\""]
["25:52,160","25:55,200","\"He wouldn't waker it still looks nice, and I just like I got a\""]
["25:55,200","25:59,320","\"Nostalgia boner through the ocean clean sunshine had some fun ideas\""]
["25:59,320","26:04,400","\"But even that people were not happy with that game at the time because it's like why is he cleaning stuff now?\""]
["26:04,400","26:07,040","\"People weren't happy with a lot of those decisions\""]
["26:07,040","26:12,000","\"And it's weird to think back to that as part of the reason you have Twilight Princess because people really wanted to have a\""]
["26:12,000","26:16,560","\"Because it was the pushback of like we want serious. Yeah, we were sick and make everything great\""]
["26:16,560","26:23,200","\"But it was real that was a thing and it's a shame because the gameCUBE had a lot of really fun titles on it\""]
["26:23,200","26:27,880","\"You know, it's crazy when I played win wicker when I came out. I was like this rocks and then I\""]
["26:27,880","26:32,480","\"Think like a year or two later. I got the master collection\""]
["26:32,480","26:38,480","\"Uh-huh, I was like 15 or 16 at the time and then I played ocarina of time for the first time and I\""]
["26:39,120","26:42,160","\"When I put it in and like looked at it was like this is so dated ew\""]
["26:42,160","26:47,840","\"And I was like this sucks, but then I played it for like half an hour and I was like amazing\""]
["26:47,840","26:54,080","\"I just loved it. I really liked something about a I don't know what it is with something about N64 games\""]
["26:54,080","26:56,240","\"That they had to run at such a low frame rate\""]
["26:56,240","27:00,320","\"The way that lighting would get handled the muddy textures because of a\""]
["27:00,320","27:02,800","\"Anti-aliasing and every crime yeah\""]
["27:02,800","27:09,080","\"And just getting because that hardware is something weird too in terms of like memory storage like textures\""]
["27:09,080","27:11,080","\"how they had to be handled, everything like that.\""]
["27:11,080","27:13,580","\"So usually something would be a really tiny graphic,\""]
["27:13,580","27:17,080","\"getting blown up to really, really, really gigantic sizes,\""]
["27:17,080","27:18,580","\"and it'd look muddy.\""]
["27:18,580","27:20,080","\"But I kind of like it.\""]
["27:20,080","27:21,580","\"I don't know. There's a charm to it.\""]
["27:21,580","27:23,580","\"Some games actually make good use of it.\""]
["27:23,580","27:25,580","\"I feel like Majora's Mask, for example.\""]
["27:25,580","27:28,580","\"That game, I really like the atmosphere in it.\""]
["27:28,580","27:30,080","\"I like how the characters look.\""]
["27:30,080","27:32,080","\"I like the art direction for it a lot.\""]
["27:32,080","27:34,580","\"You know what I'm really starting to like lately is\""]
["27:34,580","27:37,080","\"vertex painted skyboxes.\""]
["27:37,080","27:38,580","\"They're nice, aren't they?\""]
["27:38,580","27:45,040","\"They just somehow look good. I don't know. It's weird. Did you ever take notice of that the skybox isn't like spiral the dragon?\""]
["27:45,040","27:52,340","\"Yeah, that's one exact one something. Yeah, I couldn't believe they did that because it gets to look really crisp then too. It's neat that you can do that\""]
["27:52,340","27:55,660","\"important thing to always know\""]
["27:55,660","28:01,060","\"20 frames if your game is running at 60 20 frames. That's usually the average response time to a visual cue\""]
["28:01,060","28:07,100","\"Some people get that confused and think it's the idea of like that website where the screen goes from red to green\""]
["28:07,100","28:11,100","\"and you can test your reflex time on that. That's not the same thing as breaking a part of visual\""]
["28:11,100","28:14,060","\"cue in a game and understanding exactly what's happening. Yes, you have to process what you need\""]
["28:14,060","28:18,300","\"to do and everything. Like we're in a fighting game, for example, if someone's doing an overhead\""]
["28:18,300","28:22,940","\"attack to you, you have to understand the concept of that. It's not you just responding to a visual\""]
["28:22,940","28:27,100","\"cue. It's you looking at it, breaking it apart and going, they're in the air and they're about to\""]
["28:27,100","28:33,340","\"hit me. So there's more of a process going on with that. Audio cues are a faster response time for\""]
["28:33,340","28:38,340","\"for people though. So you can always work those in if you want to have something quick.\""]
["28:38,340","28:46,140","\"No. Poor Mad Rat. But at least he got a new song. He's having a real shit day, honestly.\""]
["28:46,140","28:51,540","\"Too bad he has to keep reliving it too. Gotta feel bad for the little guy. What do you think\""]
["28:51,540","28:57,260","\"this rat god Chris? I think she's actually kind of beautiful. She's my type if you don't\""]
["28:57,260","28:59,580","\"understand. The one, the type that tells you when you're\""]
["28:59,580","29:06,720","\"Yeah, very happily happens to rats a lot. Oh, do you feel even worse? Say no\""]
["29:06,720","29:10,820","\"Understand\""]
["29:10,820","29:15,080","\"You despise being tied down by rules this lab is dangerous\""]

["29:21,260","29:24,740","\"No, I wanted to stay here anyway\""]
["29:24,740","29:27,260","\"Why would you stay here?\""]
["29:28,860","29:34,020","\"All right, then this is all the time we have for now. Goodbye everybody. It's time to awake\""]
