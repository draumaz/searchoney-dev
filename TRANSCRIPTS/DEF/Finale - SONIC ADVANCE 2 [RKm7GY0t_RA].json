["01:26,080","01:33,960","\"Chris, if you could run as fast as Sonic, but it would still exert the same amount of forces regular running would you still drive?\""]
["01:33,960","01:41,080","\"No, I'd get used to running fast. You'd be the only person in the world. You'd be like, I gotta make use of this.\""]
["01:41,080","01:46,980","\"Yeah, you don't want to like that's a superpower. You don't want to neglect. I've thought about well not that specifically\""]
["01:46,980","01:51,360","\"But almost every time someone asked me a hypothetical unless it sounds fucking horrible\""]

["02:28,720","02:32,120","\"All it takes to be famous is to be different in a weird way.\""]
["02:32,120","02:33,620","\"Uh, yeah, pretty much.\""]
["02:33,620","02:35,120","\"I think so.\""]

["02:45,120","02:46,120","\"I drive around all the time.\""]

["03:22,160","03:25,020","\"What do you mean because they could play piano so much better?\""]
["03:25,020","03:30,160","\"I think that's just a result of having tiger parents that don't let them have fun childhood\""]
["03:30,160","03:36,200","\"But it's always them. It's always they're always better at like faster stuff like video games and like music\""]
["03:36,200","03:40,880","\"They're also better at making video games and music music. Yeah, I\""]
["03:40,880","03:44,880","\"Mean it's true when you don't have a childhood in all your force to do is work\""]
["03:44,880","03:50,540","\"You enjoy the little things in life a little more than you would also Bruce Lee you can see time slow\""]

["04:27,640","04:29,640","\"I just can't at all. It's so weird\""]
["04:29,640","04:34,580","\"It's just a matter of like getting warmed up. So I wonder if there's like a way to tap into it Chris\""]
["04:34,980","04:40,940","\"We just warm each other up by like holding each other you keep suggesting that it's 87 degrees in here\""]

["05:01,860","05:04,940","\"Where you like use the gravity to go up and down it's a really cool idea\""]

["05:25,940","05:29,140","\"They would make playing the game so much more fun. I think\""]
["05:30,180","05:36,220","\"Come on. Would you just jump me? Why did you stop? Why'd you hesitate you freaking weirdo?\""]
["05:36,220","05:38,960","\"Would you consider Sonic a weirdo?\""]
["05:38,960","05:40,920","\"Absolutely\""]
["05:40,920","05:42,920","\"Consider sonic pissing me off\""]

["05:57,900","06:01,420","\"And it's like it seems less hard to it's clever. It's a clever one\""]
["06:01,420","06:06,620","\"But I'm also being stupid and making poor decisions. Well, you gotta ring that's good to choose when you\""]
["06:06,620","06:12,020","\"Gravity to the no, yeah, you can choose whenever you want, but I'm having you rings and I'm scared\""]
["06:12,020","06:19,060","\"You got this you guys ever like go to take a shit and then realize you forgot your phone and you're just like it's not worth it\""]
["06:19,060","06:24,260","\"To take a shit until you get your phone. Yeah, well, I forget my phone. I just put my head of my hands and they go\""]
["06:24,260","06:26,260","\"What am I doing with my life?\""]
["06:26,260","06:32,260","\"Honestly taking a shit on your phone makes you actually makes you take a full shit, and I will stand by that\""]
["06:32,260","06:37,880","\"I genuinely would I genuinely think if you shit with a phone you take longer shit\""]
["06:37,880","06:45,180","\"If you shit without a phone you take shorter shit, but I do believe that's because like you're you're saying they're scrolling through Twitter\""]
["06:45,180","06:47,800","\"You're just like clenching and being like do I have any more in there?\""]
["06:47,800","06:49,860","\"You're kind of working and I know this is gross\""]
["06:49,860","06:54,900","\"But you're not supposed to fucking squeeze it out like you're trying to kill the back of the ball\""]
["06:54,900","06:58,880","\"Well the problem is normally I feel like people don't get full shit\""]
["06:58,880","07:04,540","\"But if you do like when your phone makes you do it because you're just sitting there like moving around like trying to get\""]
["07:04,540","07:07,380","\"Adjustable you scroll around and stuff yeah exactly yeah\""]
["07:07,380","07:13,900","\"So the best way to take a shit is bring something that can entertain you you know a paddle ball one of those ball and cup things\""]
["07:13,900","07:19,040","\"Whatever or go with the 21st century and use a phone or yeah, and I I think this is a last\""]
["07:19,340","07:23,060","\"Why not a real human being what happened to face-to-face conversation?\""]
["07:23,060","07:24,900","\"This is the last stage. Guess what it is.\""]
["07:24,900","07:27,740","\"A boss rush. Yep. Every single boss. Sucks.\""]
["07:27,740","07:30,340","\"It's the worst shit. I hate it when the face do this shit.\""]
["07:30,340","07:35,980","\"I hate it when games do this too. Nobody likes boss rushes unless it's like something that's like optional.\""]
["07:35,980","07:38,980","\"This. Nobody wants to do a boss rush to the last boss rush.\""]
["07:38,980","07:42,220","\"Yeah, it's just like- I remember they used to do that a lot.\""]
["07:42,220","07:45,580","\"There were a few games that I never beat as a kid because they ended with a boss rush.\""]
["07:45,580","07:49,020","\"I don't understand why games do this. It's like the one thing people hate.\""]
["07:49,020","07:50,020","\"What is this thing?\""]
["07:50,020","07:51,980","\"People hate in games.\""]
["07:51,980","07:56,100","\"People hate fucking death pits you can't see and boss rushes.\""]
["07:56,100","07:57,700","\"They did this in all the Sonic games.\""]
["07:57,700","08:02,100","\"I don't think I ever beat the first beautiful Joe because it ends with a boss rush.\""]
["08:02,100","08:03,100","\"Aww.\""]
["08:03,100","08:04,100","\"I don't blame you.\""]
["08:04,100","08:07,020","\"I always wanted to like get into the beautiful Joe but I can never.\""]

["08:10,300","08:11,860","\"No, I don't think so.\""]
["08:11,860","08:12,860","\"You should.\""]
["08:12,860","08:13,860","\"I think it's a good one.\""]
["08:13,860","08:14,860","\"That game rocks.\""]
["08:14,860","08:15,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:15,860","08:16,860","\"I remember it being really cool.\""]
["08:16,860","08:17,860","\"It's very stylistic.\""]
["08:17,860","08:23,200","\"Corey you actually are kicking ass. Holy shit. Holy fuck. What's out?\""]
["08:23,200","08:26,860","\"Oh, I wasn't ready. Are these tone down versions of these boxes?\""]
["08:26,860","08:32,140","\"He's like it fucking Merck him in five seconds. I think this has been playing this game a little longer\""]
["08:32,140","08:35,380","\"I'm used to it. Yeah, you used to the controls now. Yeah. Oh, no\""]
["08:35,380","08:38,620","\"Still bad at getting away from those\""]
["08:38,620","08:41,260","\"Nice\""]
["08:41,260","08:47,300","\"They I feel like you have to do it less you have to hit them less. Yeah, it's like five times or four times instead\""]
["08:47,300","08:49,300","\"This thing's annoying.\""]
["08:49,300","08:50,300","\"What's wrong with it?\""]
["08:50,300","08:53,300","\"You were okay with this boss a second ago and now you're mad.\""]
