["04:42,960","04:45,560","\"It's gonna okay\""]
["04:45,560","04:50,600","\"Left shift and oh you can still do that left shift and click is dive. Oh\""]
["04:50,600","04:53,680","\"Oh, that's really cool\""]
["04:53,680","04:56,960","\"Okay, that makes like sense intuitive\""]

["05:24,280","05:26,720","\"In this game then all games\""]
["05:28,800","05:35,320","\"Sometimes I don't think it's appropriate but here it gives it like a like a Mars rover footage kind of look\""]
["05:35,320","05:41,260","\"Yeah, true. I think it thematically fits. Whoa, I think that's here. That's your level boundary\""]

["05:43,960","05:52,680","\"Oh, there's like what it was long. There's like trees or something. Yeah, that is exactly an alien tree. Oh\""]
["05:56,680","05:58,680","\"The atmosphere is so fucking cool\""]
["05:58,680","06:06,300","\"So this this planet is called like far tiggy is for or something right yeah something like that it always\""]
["06:06,300","06:09,120","\"Was strange to me and like\""]
["06:09,120","06:14,520","\"And like sci-fi and stuff like that when a planet like has like a no\""]
["06:14,520","06:19,520","\"Just because it's like if it's a planet that's got aliens and shit on it\""]
["06:19,520","06:24,720","\"When you get there and the aliens would be like oh, yeah, this is called like plon\""]
["06:24,720","06:29,720","\"They wouldn't call it like some weird numerical thing.\""]
["06:29,720","06:30,720","\"- They would agree with you,\""]
["06:30,720","06:32,720","\"but it's like how we call Germany, Germany,\""]
["06:32,720","06:33,720","\"they call it Deutschland.\""]
["06:33,720","06:36,720","\"- Yeah, but if you got to Germany and you were like,\""]
["06:36,720","06:40,720","\"this is Pangius IV and they're like, it's Deutschland.\""]
["06:40,720","06:43,720","\"You'd probably be like, yeah, it's probably better, you know?\""]
["06:43,720","06:45,720","\"- You say we should be calling Germany Deutschland.\""]
["06:45,720","06:47,720","\"- No, because Germany is a word.\""]
["06:47,720","06:50,720","\"- Yeah, but they call themselves Deutschland.\""]
["06:50,720","06:53,720","\"- Isn't that silly?\""]
["06:53,720","06:56,360","\"So that's just they just got it wrong.\""]
["06:56,360","06:57,560","\"We'll just messed off.\""]
["06:57,560","06:59,320","\"But I think I think if you've got a number.\""]
["06:59,320","07:00,760","\"Oh, you scared off that.\""]
["07:00,760","07:03,800","\"If you got a number on it, safe to say you're wrong, you know?\""]
["07:03,800","07:06,600","\"I love those droplets on the screen.\""]
["07:06,600","07:09,400","\"I love that music is perfect for this type of game too.\""]
["07:09,400","07:11,800","\"Yeah, it's nice and vibey.\""]
["07:11,800","07:14,760","\"Makes me feel like we're in Interstellar the movie or something.\""]
["07:14,760","07:19,560","\"I feel like if I were and don't laugh\""]
["07:19,560","07:21,160","\"because I know this is a funny subject,\""]
["07:21,160","07:27,200","\"But I feel like genuinely this would be like a good weed game. Oh fucking zone out and\""]
["07:27,200","07:32,840","\"Light one up if you live in a state where it's legal which we do which which we do oh\""]
["07:32,840","07:41,260","\"This would be fun as fuck to play in VR. I don't know if it's sick, but I would love\""]
["07:41,260","07:44,520","\"Really good. It never feels like it slows down or anything\""]
["07:44,520","07:50,600","\"Is that really where I'm going? I'm I getting closer seems like it earlier at the bottom left a little thing\""]
["07:50,600","07:54,880","\"Pup it said model at 40 kilometers or something. So you're going through some\""]
["07:54,880","07:59,120","\"model of. Look at me go dude. I love you. You whole ass.\""]
["07:59,120","08:03,200","\"Yeah. You know, it's like even though it's technically far away, the fact that\""]
["08:03,200","08:08,400","\"he moves so fast makes it feel. It's fucking worth it. It doesn't feel like\""]
["08:08,400","08:13,600","\"you're traveling a large distance. It's such a clever idea for a game. Yeah.\""]
["08:13,600","08:18,440","\"It's like weird dream logic. It's really fun. It does feel like a lucid dream or\""]
["08:18,440","08:24,200","\"something yeah baby cuz if you had\""]
["08:24,200","08:25,800","\"dreams you travel about that fast it's\""]
["08:25,800","08:28,720","\"like you're just a weird ball here\""]
["08:28,720","08:33,560","\"your political ball yeah oh yeah look at\""]
["08:33,560","08:37,000","\"that I'm getting close I love that\""]
["08:37,000","08:39,000","\"rain sound like where it's like\""]
["08:39,000","08:40,760","\"clicking on the other glide like that\""]
["08:40,760","08:43,680","\"I don't know maybe we can upgrade it at\""]
["08:43,680","08:46,400","\"some point oh does that run out yeah it\""]
["08:46,400","08:50,960","\"Does yeah, I wish there was little like Sasquatch is walking around that you could run over\""]
["08:50,960","08:55,600","\"Try to grab you all fighting over imagine how fun it would be to run over a guy with this thing\""]
["08:55,600","08:58,120","\"Yeah, the top was head off of that\""]
["08:58,120","09:01,460","\"Yeah, see it fizzles out, and then you're forced to roll\""]
["09:01,460","09:07,500","\"Like their legs just fucking explode. I don't know how big this thing is like I don't know\""]
["09:07,500","09:10,000","\"Yeah, we decided like a person or like a little yeah\""]
["09:10,000","09:15,440","\"I don't know if we're like Mars Rover sized or if we're like guy sized, you know\""]
["09:15,440","09:20,780","\"Like I don't know if there's actually a guy in there because he's talking about getting other astronauts back\""]
["09:20,780","09:25,120","\"So I assume judging by the size of the smoke I say we're four feet tall\""]
["09:25,120","09:31,280","\"Well, that what it seems like but you never know could just be like really tall bushes and shit\""]
["09:31,280","09:33,500","\"Whoa\""]

["10:27,240","10:29,920","\"Shit, we're back\""]
["10:29,920","10:33,760","\"We're back to run another planet. It's pretty cool\""]
["10:33,760","10:39,800","\"The sound design is great - you really feel you're the wind yeah, I feel like the winds between my toes right now\""]
["10:40,440","10:46,520","\"What planet do you think this is oh look at that big they already said it was called like no we just called on nearly on\""]
["10:46,520","10:49,080","\"Five, but what's the point of it?\""]

["10:58,840","11:07,160","\"Doesn't do is I hope that it's not just rolling the entire way like I better remote the transportation like I hope there's like things to do\""]
["11:07,960","11:10,760","\"Yeah, you have to have stuff in the world to do I agree what the fuck\""]
["11:10,760","11:16,980","\"What's happening are those like something glowing over there? That's not the beacon you can go through that\""]

["11:36,820","11:38,820","\"I\""]
["11:38,820","11:43,280","\"Hope the light gets more more complex and bigger as it goes on\""]
["11:43,280","11:47,700","\"Yeah, I think you see anything else\""]
["11:47,700","11:55,860","\"I mean, I think that this is pretty much what the game is probably gonna be but it's probably just like a journey kind of a game\""]
["11:55,860","12:02,740","\"Pick lit fucking I love you\""]
["12:05,300","12:07,300","\"Cool, I love you too\""]

["12:10,120","12:16,740","\"Some kind of enemy or just something that if you rolled into it it like reacted in some way\""]
["12:16,740","12:18,740","\"Yeah, exactly like a giant\""]
["12:18,740","12:26,440","\"Inspirianable because you do build up a lot of speed. Yeah, so like like ripping the head ripping through like and like\""]
["12:26,440","12:27,740","\"I know you were kind of joking\""]
["12:27,740","12:32,540","\"But like if there was actually a giant robot or something that you could just pound through\""]
["12:32,940","12:40,820","\"That would actually be so sick. Yeah, we're living imagine a giant like a four-legged alien and you slam through like a bullet\""]
["12:40,820","12:42,380","\"Yeah\""]
["12:42,380","12:47,060","\"Whoa, that would legitimately be sick like if you like went through with like the meat. Yeah\""]
["12:47,060","12:50,900","\"So when you find these do they carry you I guess oh?\""]
["12:50,900","12:53,940","\"Whoa\""]
["12:53,940","13:01,020","\"What are we going for energy service protected? Yeah, so there I assume the energy source is that thing\""]
["13:01,460","13:03,460","\"Can we go to it? Yeah\""]
["13:03,460","13:06,860","\"I'll be running out of that juice\""]

["13:14,360","13:17,000","\"Full containment really cool\""]
["13:17,000","13:19,740","\"That's awesome\""]

["29:29,420","29:35,460","\"Yeah, this game is crazy, dude. This is what no man's guy should have been yeah. I was just thinking that\""]
["29:35,460","29:37,460","\"Whoo!\""]
["29:37,460","29:40,860","\"So where am I going, huh?\""]
["29:40,860","29:45,280","\"Can you not see the light in the distance? Maybe I am supposed to be under the water. I\""]
["29:45,280","29:51,180","\"Somehow doubt that considering it shoots you out of the water and starts glitching out when you hit the bottom\""]
["29:51,180","29:56,800","\"No, I think it was that he stopped and then just waited. Yeah, I don't know if I was supposed to do that\""]
["29:56,800","29:58,860","\"I got I better go do it again. I think that's a way for you to get out\""]
["29:58,860","30:04,580","\"It was I hit that and then it didn't know what to do because we're heading straight up\""]
["30:04,580","30:06,580","\"Seemed like that was intentional\""]
["30:06,580","30:10,820","\"Oh, there you go see look yeah, it does\""]
["30:10,820","30:19,300","\"That's a good little not seem right it did it twice though, so I think that is just with the effect if it gets to look\""]

["30:31,820","30:36,820","\"Okay, so we're just gonna skip like a skipping stone. Yeah, that seems like the idea\""]
["30:36,820","30:42,020","\"Cuz it doesn't really seem to want you to go under it. Oh, yeah, that's awesome\""]
["30:42,020","30:46,780","\"That is so clever. Oh, maybe I should jump when I'm hitting the water. Oh\""]
["30:46,780","30:53,740","\"Fuck no, it's really hard. Whoa, what is that? Or maybe like dip under the water and then like\""]
["30:53,740","30:58,640","\"Then flatten out and let it shoot you out. Oh, we should have a little ball break. Well\""]
