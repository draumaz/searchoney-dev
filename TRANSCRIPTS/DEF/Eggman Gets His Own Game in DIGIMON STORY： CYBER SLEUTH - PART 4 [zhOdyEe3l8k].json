["03:35,260","03:41,220","\"Ever since the first game he's always been fast fucking leans left and right super hard. They should make a full game of Eggman\""]
["03:41,220","03:45,940","\"I'd love that I definitely would play it. I definitely was the main character and\""]
["03:45,940","03:50,840","\"Going to be they were focusing on his design first if they made a game where your eggman\""]
["03:50,840","03:54,740","\"You just kick animals. Hell yeah, it would be in character\""]
["03:54,740","03:58,120","\"You can make a fun game with them if you're egg no a good game would be your eggman\""]
["03:58,120","04:02,480","\"And you can turn animals into your little robots to help you all would be a fun game\""]
["04:02,480","04:06,760","\"Yeah, and it'd be called dr. Eggman's big egg fucking adventure big\""]
["04:10,060","04:12,320","\"It's a working title. Yeah, you go\""]
["04:12,320","04:15,260","\"Play it if there's an egg man game. I would do it\""]
["04:15,260","04:18,160","\"I think it'd be fun and the funnel boss is sonic of course\""]
["04:18,160","04:24,180","\"It would be like raising chow that it's the idea of like okay when you just size an animal you have to figure out what\""]
["04:24,180","04:30,600","\"Like attributes you want to give it do it better than their shooting stages in a sonic adventure - yeah\""]
["04:30,600","04:33,000","\"No, no, no, don't put him in his fucking mech\""]
["04:35,300","04:37,300","\"I would much I would want him running\""]
["04:37,300","04:41,920","\"I think the shooting mini game and Sonic Adventure 1 isn't as bad as some of the stages in 2\""]
["04:41,920","04:44,800","\"But it's like it's not what I'd want for something like that\""]
["04:44,800","04:51,580","\"Yeah, I want him rolling into a ball because he could very easily he could roll into a ball breaks his legs up to the side\""]
["04:51,580","05:00,140","\"What he comes out of the ball he's just laying there\""]
["05:01,180","05:07,800","\"Good idea. We should push this to Sega do it. They said don't take no risk your fucking fingers out of yours\""]
["05:07,800","05:13,000","\"Get off Twitter and fucking listen to my idea if Chris can't get off Twitter and get on YouTube\""]
["05:13,000","05:20,340","\"Yes, I'm making funny sonic tweets get over here quit saying sonic sucks and make it suck\""]
["05:20,340","05:25,620","\"Whoa, hey look at that we got some monsters I\""]

["05:44,820","05:45,660","\"- Oh, I remember that.\""]
["05:45,660","05:46,500","\"- I mean, that's how you pitch it.\""]
["05:46,500","05:47,340","\"You have to pitch with confidence.\""]
["05:47,340","05:48,780","\"You go, that's a good name.\""]
["05:48,780","05:49,660","\"- That's a good idea.\""]

["05:52,820","05:54,380","\"those we was talking about.\""]
["05:54,380","05:56,980","\"- And what we're doing, Doctor Eggs leg,\""]
["05:56,980","06:03,980","\"Well, Dr. Eggman has been humiliated by Sonic for the last time.\""]
["06:03,980","06:04,980","\"He takes up an AK.\""]
["06:04,980","06:06,980","\"Okay, no, never mind.\""]
["06:06,980","06:08,980","\"What's in his mouth?\""]
["06:08,980","06:11,980","\"No, there's no never mind during a pitch.\""]
["06:11,980","06:13,980","\"Wait, no, dumb idea.\""]
["06:13,980","06:14,980","\"This is dumb.\""]
["06:14,980","06:15,980","\"Okay.\""]
["06:15,980","06:17,980","\"I want to make a game by the way.\""]
["06:17,980","06:18,980","\"Here's my other idea.\""]
["06:18,980","06:19,980","\"It's like about a bird.\""]
["06:19,980","06:21,980","\"He like, fly through rings or something.\""]
["06:21,980","06:22,980","\"Okay, no, no, it's okay.\""]
["06:22,980","06:25,980","\"It's Dr. Eggman's party and all of his robot friends are there.\""]
["06:25,980","06:28,980","\"He's not just stealing the start of generations.\""]
["06:28,980","06:32,580","\"Anyway, he's sitting at his desk when Sonic breaks in.\""]
["06:32,580","06:35,180","\"He starts running on his cake and being a real piece of shit.\""]
["06:35,180","06:36,180","\"Running on his cake?\""]
["06:36,180","06:37,180","\"Running on his cake.\""]
["06:37,180","06:38,180","\"He's running in place?\""]
["06:38,180","06:41,580","\"Yes, he's drinking all over the robots and breaking them all.\""]
["06:41,580","06:43,180","\"It's a funny visual, all over the world.\""]
["06:43,180","06:44,180","\"And Dr. Eggman's--\""]
["06:44,180","06:45,380","\"And he says, you're too fad.\""]
["06:45,380","06:46,380","\"He goes, bam, bam, bam.\""]
["06:46,380","06:47,380","\"No, I'm kidding.\""]
["06:47,380","06:48,380","\"[LAUGHTER]\""]
["06:48,380","06:49,380","\"No, I'm kidding.\""]
["06:49,380","06:50,880","\"He goes, you're too fad.\""]
["06:50,880","06:52,880","\"He goes, no.\""]
["06:52,880","06:55,880","\"And then Sonic smashes into space, sucking eggman\""]
["06:55,880","07:01,160","\"the space he floats through space for 78 years and he's frozen in time until\""]
["07:01,160","07:06,560","\"Rouge the Bat finds the time crystals which resurrected\""]
["07:06,560","07:19,400","\"I'm sorry Dr. Eggman is broken he's floating through space he's frozen okay\""]
["07:19,400","07:21,400","\"Who finds him who else?\""]
["07:21,400","07:23,880","\"Yeah, I don't know who else but\""]
["07:23,880","07:30,160","\"Maria Maria finds oh my god. She's alive. She's been floating through space - everyone the boardroom\""]
["07:30,160","07:34,480","\"They would perk up right now go. That's a whole character. People like that one Maria's back\""]
["07:34,480","07:38,520","\"And she's not dead. So what happens with her?\""]
["07:38,520","07:44,540","\"So it turns out floating in space annihilated the space age and she's actually okay, but when her and Eggman collide\""]
["07:44,540","07:46,540","\"I thought she got shy\""]
["07:46,540","07:48,800","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:48,800","07:51,680","\"- What are the Eggman Coli?\""]
["07:51,680","07:53,520","\"- Did they get shot at this place?\""]
["07:53,520","07:55,960","\"- And her Eggman Coli to create enough heat\""]
["07:55,960","07:57,520","\"that it warms them both.\""]
["07:57,520","07:58,360","\"- Wow.\""]
["07:58,360","08:02,120","\"- And they both start breathing in which it's fast.\""]
["08:02,120","08:04,160","\"So they don't run out of breath.\""]
["08:04,160","08:06,080","\"- So what's the gameplay mechanic?\""]
["08:06,080","08:07,480","\"How does this work?\""]
["08:07,480","08:08,920","\"- This is still the first cut scene.\""]
["08:08,920","08:10,200","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:10,200","08:11,600","\"- No, we're still in that one.\""]
["08:11,600","08:13,360","\"So here's the cool part.\""]
["08:13,360","08:14,200","\"- We're in the pro line.\""]
["08:14,200","08:15,760","\"- Now that they're both like, you know,\""]
["08:15,760","08:19,240","\"They're intertwined in space holding each other's hands. Okay. They're like well\""]
["08:19,240","08:23,520","\"We're not gonna last long but at least we're gonna die together and dr. Eggman grabs her and kicks off of her\""]
["08:23,520","08:28,640","\"So he could propel himself back to earth. Oh, that's really nice. She flies into the Sun and a black hole\""]
["08:28,640","08:32,880","\"But then she like combines with the Sun and becomes like a demon monster. She becomes mega Maria\""]
["08:32,880","08:42,080","\"She's gonna make Maria land\""]
["08:42,080","08:44,080","\"She's in the sun.\""]
["08:44,080","08:47,080","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:47,080","08:51,080","\"She's making Maria, and she's building a sun layer.\""]
["08:51,080","08:54,080","\"Eggman's like, you're riding back to Earth\""]
["08:54,080","08:57,080","\"and breaking up in the atmosphere.\""]
["08:57,080","08:58,080","\"But luckily--\""]
["08:58,080","08:59,080","\"- Like, Chrissy bits coming off of her.\""]
["08:59,080","09:00,080","\"- Like, Chrissy bits.\""]
["09:00,080","09:01,080","\"- Problem already.\""]
["09:01,080","09:02,080","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:02,080","09:03,080","\"- We're the rings factor into the gameplay.\""]
["09:03,080","09:04,080","\"- So here's the thing.\""]
["09:04,080","09:05,080","\"He's breaking up in the atmosphere.\""]
["09:05,080","09:07,080","\"His legs and arms are breaking up.\""]
["09:07,080","09:08,080","\"- He's screaming.\""]
["09:08,080","09:09,080","\"(laughing)\""]
["09:09,080","09:11,080","\"- And screaming, if only I had some rings.\""]
["09:11,080","09:15,040","\"Luckily he learned one lone ring which looks safe\""]
["09:15,040","09:20,140","\"That's how Maria lived to when they shot her to death she was hoping\""]
["09:20,140","09:26,400","\"Now when he looks up he sees Maria's head in the sky looking down on him and she's getting bigger by the second\""]
["09:26,400","09:31,020","\"Oh my god, it's like Majora's mass. Yes that mega Maria's coming to earth. Yes, and\""]
["09:31,020","09:38,680","\"Is there a day like there's a day in that side and he has to collect the Maria stones to fire into her with a cannon\""]
["09:39,400","09:44,960","\"No, no, that's her timer. So first of all Eggman has to meet up with shadow. That's level one. You're running the shot\""]
["09:44,960","09:51,040","\"You're running the shadow. You're running to shadow. You're you're running to his arms. So you're running to his apartment to his house. Yeah\""]
["09:51,040","09:55,900","\"an apartment there's a cut there's a cut to the inside of his apartment and you\""]
["09:55,900","10:00,720","\"Open like Kramer. He's got movie posters on the wall and he's watching the Kirby or enthusiasm\""]
["10:00,720","10:03,880","\"Yeah, but do you first you have to crawl up the garbage shoot to get to him?\""]
["10:03,880","10:07,200","\"And how do you do that?\""]
["10:08,360","10:12,520","\"Shoot zone and did that's a level that's the first level. Yeah, but choose zone\""]
["10:12,520","10:19,840","\"And then when you finally get to his door he goes hmm you again, huh? Yeah, huh?\""]
["10:19,840","10:23,860","\"girlfriend did you huh and he lets you in and\""]
["10:23,860","10:29,960","\"I know he doesn't know that yet\""]
["10:33,880","10:38,980","\"He goes, what are you doing here? Huh? And then Eggman opens the blinds really quick and the light pours in\""]
["10:38,980","10:45,820","\"Shutter walks over the light and it's like the camera pans up. He goes, \"\"Oh Maria, mega Maria!\"\"\""]
["10:45,820","10:52,940","\"\"\"Meh, mega, we hear you.\"\" Oh, there's still more left. He goes, \"\"Damn, it can't be.\"\" Not here.\""]
["10:52,940","10:54,940","\"He starts shooting at it with his gun. \"\"Yosh.\"\"\""]
["10:54,940","11:03,860","\"\"\"I'm glad that one means left to heart.\"\" I love the way that's right.\""]
["11:03,860","11:06,940","\"So he says yes, yes.\""]
["11:06,940","11:10,580","\"Anyway, Shadow sees Maria.\""]
["11:10,580","11:13,620","\"He puts the gun to his head and shoots his brain out of his head.\""]
["11:13,620","11:14,140","\"Why?\""]
["11:14,140","11:15,940","\"Shadow, because he can't comprehend.\""]
["11:15,940","11:17,820","\"He also was holding a ring.\""]
["11:17,820","11:20,500","\"And then it goes, OK, now that I thought about a little bit more,\""]
["11:20,500","11:21,460","\"I don't actually want to do that.\""]
["11:21,460","11:22,220","\"OK, that's cool.\""]
["11:22,220","11:23,820","\"OK, so now he's a good team.\""]

["14:53,760","14:55,600","\"and then\""]
["14:55,600","15:00,240","\"That fires up the master emerald starts spinning around and then the final level is called\""]
["15:00,240","15:03,080","\"The spin drum\""]
["15:03,080","15:10,720","\"Running around really fast over and over and over but you're playing as him. How does that happen?\""]

["15:16,960","15:25,440","\"On the outside you say you must defeat my beautiful Maria and you're spinning around over and over and over\""]
["15:25,440","15:28,100","\"And it's like kind of like DDR and you have to stop\""]
["15:28,100","15:33,040","\"The main thing because it has to play the main theme during those okay, we'll be fighting mega maria\""]
["15:33,040","15:35,040","\"Okay, so it's kind of like\""]
["15:35,040","15:37,200","\"industrial because of dr. Robot\""]
["15:42,800","15:46,660","\"See that's pretty cool and then dr. Robotnik sings as you play\""]
["15:46,660","16:04,660","\"It's kind of like one way an angel. It's really epic. I'll believe you do you have the choir behind it. Yeah, there's a choir of\""]

["16:12,160","16:16,880","\"President in the background bearing his robot Nick teeth anyway\""]
["16:16,880","16:26,520","\"Just a little detail that needs to be in there because you spent you have to do 999 spins and they all take a minute each\""]
["16:26,520","16:35,600","\"So it's really epic anyway once you hit the final spin. Uh-huh sonic runs and he starts running on your cake again again\""]
["16:35,600","16:41,900","\"This is the final repeated. Oh, it's the final confrontation. It's the final day stop him from doing the final cake\""]
["16:41,900","16:48,460","\"It's a final cake level cake. It's called final cake. It's really cool. That sounds like a sonic level. Yeah, it works\""]
["16:48,460","16:55,260","\"So shadows eating the cake outside the master emerald sonic runs on it. Oh, well, okay\""]
["16:55,260","16:59,500","\"Sonic to run out. Yeah, shadow throws his fork and spoon down on the ground. God\""]
["16:59,500","17:05,860","\"You always do this and then sonic laws and kick shadow to death\""]
["17:08,380","17:13,060","\"Which which calls them the fall on the lever which actually stops the master emerald from spinning\""]

["17:27,820","17:33,620","\"Which of that intern dr. Eggman's\""]
["17:33,620","17:37,960","\"The whole planet is surrounded by a thin layer of puke\""]

["19:04,620","19:05,860","\"I need to--\""]
["19:05,860","19:08,620","\"I need to actually figure out how to destroy them.\""]
["19:08,620","19:11,420","\"So Shadow mentions that 9/11 happened,\""]
["19:11,420","19:13,980","\"so maybe they can use that to their advantage.\""]
["19:13,980","19:17,280","\"I'm imagining there's just like a child babbling.\""]
