["21:04,420","21:07,680","\"Yeah, that would make sense especially for a game like this like\""]
["21:07,680","21:16,420","\"You wouldn't want people to just like stay and collect every single thing or if they do you want to just make it harder for them exactly\""]

["22:16,460","22:21,220","\"you fight like that giant like amorphous black blob.\""]
