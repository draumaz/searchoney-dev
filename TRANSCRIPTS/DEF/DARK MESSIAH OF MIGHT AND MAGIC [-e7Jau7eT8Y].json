["00:24,800","00:26,000","\"I have no idea.\""]
["00:26,000","00:28,320","\"It almost seems like it might not be an accident.\""]

["05:20,040","05:23,040","\"they have them do dental work on like pig heads and shit like that?\""]
["05:23,040","05:26,040","\"That's probably if they're training you to fight zombies,\""]
["05:26,040","05:28,040","\"the first one they make you kill is probably a kid.\""]
["05:28,040","05:30,040","\"I see.\""]
["05:30,040","05:32,040","\"The sound smaller gives you less trouble.\""]

["06:01,040","06:03,040","\"I get mine at the grocery store.\""]
["06:03,040","06:08,040","\"And then anybody with the strength to cut the head off a pig is not going to become a dentist.\""]
["06:08,040","06:12,960","\"Not gonna become a dentist, but what about cutting the head off a camel that\""]
["06:12,960","06:16,920","\"Do the thing\""]
