["07:44,460","07:45,300","\"- Wait, hold on, let me see.\""]
["07:45,300","07:46,140","\"- It's just not looping right.\""]
["07:46,140","07:47,460","\"I can't, I can't for that.\""]
["07:47,460","07:50,340","\"- No, it's really frustrating.\""]
["07:50,340","07:51,660","\"- Wow.\""]
["07:51,660","07:54,180","\"- Anyway, yeah, just to be a picky bitch.\""]
["07:54,180","07:56,380","\"- I prefer it from, it was like a platform fighter,\""]
["07:56,380","08:00,620","\"of the thing. Just like jumping around beating the shit out of things in real time.\""]
["08:00,620","08:02,140","\"Nice, that was good.\""]
["08:02,140","08:05,580","\"Do you think there's any way to do that with including like your little like puddle pounce?\""]
["08:05,580","08:06,580","\"Okay, you're gonna kill good.\""]
["08:06,580","08:07,580","\"Probably not, no.\""]
["08:07,580","08:10,540","\"See like you get it, I don't, I don't get it at all.\""]
["08:10,540","08:13,740","\"I mean you could just probably swap out between them or something, I don't know.\""]
["08:13,740","08:15,740","\"Yeah, sure.\""]
["08:15,740","08:19,260","\"And you're beating all of theirs at?\""]
["08:19,260","08:22,580","\"Damn it, I fucking could have had it there if I just kept that combo going.\""]
["08:22,580","08:25,860","\"annoying annoying could you not give her any other fucking line when she blocks\""]
["08:25,860","08:30,260","\"how do you make a combo keep going you start mashing the buttons\""]
["08:30,260","08:34,260","\"ultimately yeah I just don't really like or PG's that much\""]
["08:34,260","08:37,620","\"the only reason I like Final Fantasy 7 and\""]
["08:37,620","08:41,540","\"the old Pokemon games because I played them growing up\""]
["08:41,540","08:45,060","\"I liked I mean that's fair if I hadn't played them I'd hate them\""]
["08:45,060","08:47,940","\"Final Fantasy 12 to me was like the pinnacle of\""]
["08:47,940","08:52,180","\"I like that combo at the most Final Fantasy 12 is such a slog though\""]
["08:52,180","08:59,500","\"My favorite RPG would probably be the Legend of Dragon, which I've said numerous times.\""]
["08:59,500","09:05,900","\"That is a very, very good game because its combat is like interactive.\""]
["09:05,900","09:08,900","\"So when you attack an enemy, if you time your attack, okay.\""]
["09:08,900","09:13,900","\"I like picking up a game.\""]
["09:13,900","09:15,740","\"Duck, dude.\""]
["09:15,740","09:16,740","\"Or shoot it.\""]
["09:16,740","09:17,740","\"Yeah, shoot it.\""]
["09:17,740","09:18,740","\"Oh shit.\""]
["09:18,740","09:20,740","\"Or get the fuck out of there.\""]
["09:20,740","09:21,740","\"Or just run.\""]
["09:21,740","09:22,740","\"Oh god.\""]
["09:22,740","09:26,540","\"One of my favorite things to do is pick up a game for the first time and feel like the\""]
["09:26,540","09:29,140","\"controls and this is so fun.\""]
["09:29,140","09:34,340","\"I guess probably one of my favorite RPGs would either be like, it's either like F of 7 or\""]
["09:34,340","09:37,100","\"like the Shin Megami Ten-Sai games.\""]
["09:37,100","09:40,020","\"The only reason I like F of 7 is because I like the story and the music.\""]
["09:40,020","09:41,020","\"Oh man.\""]
["09:41,020","09:42,020","\"Persona?\""]
["09:42,020","09:43,020","\"Persona is a really good RPG.\""]
["09:43,020","09:44,940","\"That's why you're right now.\""]
["09:44,940","09:49,660","\"I hadn't played the Persona games and I played Persona 5 and then literally all of them 400 hours later\""]
["09:49,660","09:50,660","\"I played them all.\""]
["09:50,660","09:51,660","\"The Persona games are kind of amazing.\""]
["09:51,660","09:54,980","\"Jeff's fucking story for Persona 5 is so goddamn funny.\""]
["09:54,980","09:57,700","\"Have we ever talked about it?\""]
["09:57,700","09:59,980","\"I think we might have at some point actually.\""]
["09:59,980","10:01,820","\"I can recap if you like.\""]
["10:01,820","10:04,820","\"I don't want to throw you under the bus, Jeff, but it is so funny to me.\""]
["10:04,820","10:07,300","\"The area that you kind of ate shit in.\""]
["10:07,300","10:09,460","\"Do you want me to just say it real fast?\""]
["10:09,460","10:10,620","\"Yeah, I just say it.\""]
["10:10,620","10:11,620","\"So I bought Persona 5.\""]
["10:11,620","10:14,900","\"It's not typically the game I would play, but I'm like, you know what?\""]
["10:14,900","10:18,100","\"Nobody told you to buy it you still bought it listen to be fair\""]
["10:18,100","10:23,180","\"You you guys are talking about you guys are pretty excited. I was out wait\""]
["10:23,180","10:27,420","\"I mean Tom or me and Tom were talking about it all the time all I knew okay\""]
["10:27,420","10:33,160","\"I'm like the the anime aesthetic and I was like we'll put off but I'm like you know you run around town\""]
["10:33,160","10:36,540","\"You do many you know you do lots of little little minigames\""]
["10:36,540","10:40,540","\"Yeah, I do like RPGs to some extent so like okay\""]
["10:41,100","10:45,380","\"So I bought I know nothing about persona. I've never played a persona before yeah\""]
["10:45,380","10:54,400","\"So the first thing that kind of put me off a little bit was the day's ending premature like you go through you have like\""]
["10:54,400","10:59,180","\"Every day every day you early you can do like an activity, but sometimes you can do more\""]
["10:59,180","11:03,660","\"I don't know sometimes every day is almost like it's like from morning tonight\""]
["11:03,660","11:07,180","\"If you can do an activity in the morning, which usually takes away then you do stuff at night\""]
["11:07,180","11:12,500","\"Yeah, it's like if you go through the game the game has a calendar and you live out every single day over the course of almost a year\""]
["11:12,500","11:19,500","\"But based on like the narrative and the plot and like what's going on like if it's a school night or not a day might be longer or shorter\""]
["11:19,500","11:22,020","\"I thought about a contract of time. Someone did okay\""]
["11:22,020","11:24,020","\"I'm gonna work at the convenience store\""]
["11:24,020","11:28,740","\"And then go to the batting cages and then I then if I have any time left whatever go home\""]
["11:28,740","11:33,140","\"But instead it's just like you do one thing if dad's like time to go to bed signing yeah\""]
["11:35,620","11:38,220","\"He's not your dad you get shoved in the attic and you have to go to sleep\""]
["11:38,220","11:41,660","\"Here's 20 days until like you run out of time\""]
["11:41,660","11:43,900","\"So I'm like\""]
["11:43,900","11:47,180","\"But the your friends are like hey man. We don't have to be it\""]
["11:47,180","11:51,420","\"We don't have time for this we have to get into it we have to get into the dream and save this person\""]

["17:26,820","17:32,020","\"I will say though it still is kind of relaxing to be living out your life and doing all the fun shit they have planned though, right?\""]
["17:32,020","17:35,380","\"I love persona. I've never played a game that made me care more about my\""]

["17:52,380","17:53,380","\"You like weeks of bad meaning.\""]
["17:53,380","17:56,380","\"I thought once you beat the boss it like reset.\""]

["17:57,380","17:59,380","\"I don't know why I thought that.\""]
["17:59,380","18:01,380","\"Oh, by the way, this is really cool.\""]
["18:01,380","18:04,380","\"But things fall in so you have like high jump gravity.\""]
["18:04,380","18:08,580","\"That's a really cool idea. That is cool. I don't feel like we've been too harsh on this\""]
["18:08,580","18:12,520","\"I feel like we've been realistic. No, I mean it doesn't like it doesn't like criticizing game\""]
["18:12,520","18:16,220","\"We're not fucking reviewers, but we're just saying like you know just things that you look at on the surface\""]
["18:16,220","18:20,700","\"It's a little bit like they're gonna hate us. Let's talk about it. They would. But it's fine\""]

["18:21,700","18:30,340","\"They would hate it. If we were like totally just be like this game was sure. I can imagine them watching this video and being annoyed\""]
["18:30,340","18:32,780","\"I don't know if some of the things are saying, and that's fair.\""]
["18:32,780","18:34,780","\"- Well, at least we're not dog and they're fucking gay.\""]
["18:34,780","18:38,820","\"- I think they did a pretty great job of a lot of things.\""]
["18:38,820","18:41,260","\"- Yeah, I think if I understood the game, I'd like to play it,\""]
["18:41,260","18:42,420","\"but I honestly don't.\""]
["18:42,420","18:44,300","\"And Dave's meant to be carrying it pretty well.\""]

["18:45,660","18:48,060","\"I was coming in expecting to actually hate it,\""]
["18:48,060","18:49,700","\"but it's really not that bad.\""]
["18:49,700","18:51,460","\"It's actually fun once you start playing it.\""]
["18:51,460","18:53,460","\"- It looks fun.\""]
["18:53,460","18:55,540","\"It's sort of one of the, it took a lot of games.\""]
["18:55,540","18:58,100","\"It sort of like, it reminds you of Astral Chain in a way\""]
["18:58,100","19:02,940","\"Like once you start out they handicap you so much. It's you wonder\""]
["19:02,940","19:08,500","\"Like if the game's ever gonna be fun, but then once like they give you enough abilities\""]
["19:08,500","19:13,460","\"Yeah, then it starts real. Then you're like now. It's like the the the competition is fully flushed out\""]
["19:13,460","19:21,420","\"I don't like any of the characters so far. Yeah, I'll be honest\""]
["19:21,420","19:25,260","\"No one stuck out to me is unique or cool or funny or interesting\""]

["19:52,980","19:58,160","\"Maybe that was the point maybe Angie is supposed to not her and she wrote a fucking name\""]
["19:58,160","20:00,520","\"Maybe she isn't supposed to seem like a good lady\""]
["20:00,520","20:03,640","\"You the emblem got it because in the village she was shitty\""]
["20:03,640","20:07,960","\"She was like under power and she was like a nobody and now she has to prove herself to her village\""]
["20:07,960","20:12,080","\"So maybe the idea that she seems like kind of underwhelming an average is like kind of\""]

["20:15,260","20:17,820","\"He's more like elite in his fucking combos\""]

["20:32,440","20:34,920","\"The floor the whole time\""]
