["00:25,800","00:28,880","\"He looks like a f*ckin' uh, like a caricature.\""]
["00:28,880","00:29,880","\"I like that.\""]
["00:29,880","00:34,080","\"I think if you pulled them back a little bit, they look a little bit better, I think.\""]
["00:34,080","00:36,240","\"It's a little bit too.\""]
["00:36,240","00:37,800","\"Like that guy's too crazy.\""]
["00:37,800","00:41,680","\"Maybe he looks like someone drawing like a caricature of Richard Nixon or something.\""]
["00:41,680","00:42,680","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:42,680","00:45,720","\"Like he looks like the Futurama Richard Nixon or some shit.\""]

["00:56,200","00:58,720","\"You want to break the disc in half because we're so angry at it?\""]
["00:58,720","00:59,720","\"I didn't get a disc.\""]
["00:59,720","01:03,720","\"That's why Fizzee said I didn't get a disc.\""]
["01:03,720","01:08,720","\"Your physical media is important for preserving the horror.\""]
["01:08,720","01:11,720","\"You know you don't actually own anything you download.\""]
["01:11,720","01:17,960","\"If a nuclear bomb were to explode above our cities it would destroy all the hard drives\""]
["01:17,960","01:19,720","\"and all the digital copies.\""]
["01:19,720","01:23,520","\"I agree with that physical media stuff except for the fact that most future consoles won't\""]
["01:23,520","01:28,320","\"play them and also sometimes discs come with like no patches on them and they're busted\""]
["01:28,320","01:32,000","\"from when you buy them because most new games don't finish the games they create.\""]
["01:32,000","01:34,160","\"That's actually true.\""]
["01:34,160","01:40,240","\"I've long and by long I mean I thought of it like last week.\""]
["01:40,240","01:47,000","\"I've always thought like we should normalize just like files.\""]
["01:47,000","01:48,760","\"Just files, you know?\""]
["01:48,760","01:49,760","\"Files, what do you mean?\""]
["01:49,760","01:50,760","\"Just file your computer?\""]
["01:50,760","01:54,400","\"Yeah, just things that give you the file for the fucking thing.\""]
["01:54,400","01:55,600","\"You know what I mean?\""]
["01:55,600","01:57,900","\"It's not in some weird proprietary like\""]
["01:57,900","02:04,240","\"Like if you wanted to get this game off your PlayStation like what could you even do it? No\""]
["02:04,240","02:07,040","\"See\""]
["02:07,040","02:12,280","\"Like a dot PS4 you play on your computer you're saying not even played on your computer. Just have it. Yeah\""]
["02:12,280","02:16,120","\"I bet I bet that will be the future. I don't really feel either\""]
["02:16,120","02:21,240","\"I don't care either way I do anything I would care about is it like a like somehow we get like a solar flare\""]
["02:21,520","02:25,000","\"There's something and everything just gets destroyed because nothing's physically backed up\""]
["02:25,000","02:31,480","\"But let's say we found like some movie that was like really like let's say let's say we were digging\""]
["02:31,480","02:38,240","\"Yeah, we found the original cut of master of disguise and it was on a on a beta max tape or something\""]
["02:38,240","02:44,520","\"And we found it in the year like 2098 how the fuck would we get to it? You know what I mean? How would we be able to?\""]
["02:44,520","02:48,080","\"Play it. Oh, I gotta do we figure it out\""]
["02:48,080","02:52,680","\"You know we set these records out in space called Voyager wanted to and they literally it's a record player\""]
["02:52,680","02:57,260","\"It's a gold record or it's a gold record and on it. They included a record player in there\""]
["02:57,260","03:03,120","\"So we assume aliens though how to you how to fucking work a record player, which is a great. Oh, that's that's stupid\""]
["03:03,120","03:09,220","\"They're not gonna ever figure that out. No, no, how do we even know they hear you know? No, they wouldn't they would just take a bite\""]
["03:09,220","03:11,220","\"at it. I think\""]
["03:11,220","03:15,200","\"Everyone draw your fan art this guy's gonna do it like he plays but draw your fan of an alien\""]
["03:15,620","03:20,500","\"Operating a golden record on a good bite taking a bite out of your favorite platinum record\""]
["03:20,500","03:24,020","\"You can specify what record they're eating. It could be like a fun little thing\""]
["03:24,020","03:29,540","\"Nailion flew down and he wanted to eat your bread. Would you say take a big buttery bite?\""]
["03:29,540","03:34,260","\"Yeah, I would say that would now you say that like he might like you pissed off or something\""]
["03:34,260","03:36,660","\"I mean, you don't need to say buttery\""]
["03:36,660","03:41,140","\"Butter's on the bread but you say you're kind of like you try to pitch it to him to make it like sound better for him\""]
["03:41,140","03:45,440","\"Because he's a guest that's it, but it might also confuse him in anger. Yeah, he might not understand\""]
["03:45,440","03:53,580","\"This is\""]
["03:53,580","03:56,220","\"Think I think an alien\""]
["03:56,220","03:59,780","\"Obducting me is probably one of a few instances one actually cry like a child\""]
["03:59,780","04:03,600","\"I actually cried like a little baby if an alien abducted me\""]
["04:03,600","04:08,740","\"I'd be happy about it if I saw an alien look again coming to my room and I could move and I knew it was asleep for elses\""]
["04:09,100","04:11,460","\"And I knew it was right. I think I actually just are crying\""]
["04:11,460","04:18,500","\"How do I just press up on the D pad while looking at that dude now? I'm this fella\""]

["06:26,860","06:30,600","\"Is it still yeah you fool\""]
["06:31,260","06:32,540","\"Why did you do that?\""]
["06:32,540","06:34,060","\"I wanted to be Robbie Rotten.\""]
["06:34,060","06:38,620","\"His horrible addiction is blinding him with greed.\""]

["06:41,580","06:44,060","\"Look, it's called \"\"Don't Kill Any Humans,\"\"\""]
["06:44,060","06:45,980","\"but on the cover it said \"\"Destroy All Humans.\"\"\""]
["06:45,980","06:46,620","\"So...\""]
["06:46,620","06:48,700","\"I don't kind of like to the actual consumer.\""]
["06:48,700","06:50,140","\"I feel justified in killing people.\""]
["06:50,140","06:51,660","\"I think you can sue them for that, does that make sense?\""]
["06:51,660","06:54,060","\"Because they like to as consumers.\""]
["06:54,060","06:55,420","\"Yeah, we should just sue them.\""]
["06:55,420","06:55,980","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:55,980","06:59,660","\"I wonder if there is like a weird work around like that\""]
["06:59,660","07:02,700","\"where you can call something a title of something and\""]
["07:02,700","07:07,420","\"Because you do that you can make like a false promise if it's like the title of your store\""]
["07:07,420","07:12,660","\"Well, what do you mean you say it's like you're still could be called everything's for free, but nothing's for free inside\""]
["07:12,660","07:15,580","\"Basically, yeah, or this is actually a real one\""]
["07:15,580","07:24,060","\"I bought a mattress at one point like one like ten years ago from a store that was literally called mattress sale\""]
["07:24,060","07:27,140","\"Yeah, dude. There was a place\""]
["07:27,980","07:35,140","\"Where we live I'm not gonna I mean there's a place nearby that had um it said like yeah like 70% off\""]
["07:35,140","07:38,880","\"Like sale that was like the title of it, but that was the name of the store\""]
["07:38,880","07:40,880","\"Yeah, it was yeah, it was like 70% off\""]
["07:40,880","07:45,320","\"We're on sale that was like the title of it and that side was also up there the whole time they were business\""]

["08:36,380","08:37,380","\"That's profound.\""]
["08:37,380","08:39,300","\"You see an alien or is he dressed up as a heilden?\""]
["08:39,300","08:41,100","\"I think he's an alien.\""]
["08:41,100","08:43,100","\"I think she fucks him as he is.\""]

["09:05,000","09:10,820","\"Why can't the game be called save all you know why can't the game be called be nice and help all humans?\""]
["09:10,820","09:14,220","\"I don't think I meant to do that. I don't yeah, I don't think\""]
