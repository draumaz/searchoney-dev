["04:56,860","05:00,580","\"All right. Well, I didn't who is how Mary?\""]
["05:01,420","05:06,940","\"Jesus his mom. Oh really? But you're saying hail to Mary like I like hail is like hey\""]
["05:06,940","05:12,820","\"It's like that. Hey. Hey Mary full of grace the Lord's would be\""]
["05:12,820","05:19,300","\"So hail Mary is his mom Mary's mom. What does hell Mary mean hails like hey?\""]
["05:19,300","05:21,820","\"Hey, oh\""]
["05:21,820","05:24,980","\"Like you're hailing someone\""]
["05:25,460","05:31,820","\"Like hi yes, does really yes, that's fucking stupid. What do you mean stupid? It's really two thousand years ago\""]

["05:35,540","05:41,500","\"No, you're just saying like hey Mary full of grit you're full of grace the Lord is with you\""]
["05:41,500","05:47,980","\"I thought you did Hail Mary is when you fucking like punch your sister in the jaw and stuff. Yes the prayer is called Hail Mary. Oh\""]
["05:47,980","05:52,340","\"Her name's not him. Yeah, but but did you ever have to do that? Yeah\""]
["05:52,420","05:58,840","\"So it's like the the Christian equivalent of like having to call your grandma like you don't want to have to do it so you\""]
["05:58,840","06:01,500","\"You're way further in a parish\""]
["06:01,500","06:06,600","\"I love climbing my crib. You know what sucks is when I was growing up a little Christian boy\""]
["06:06,600","06:10,100","\"Whatever I'd go to confession. I'd really really stress out\""]
["06:10,100","06:13,560","\"If I had forgotten any things I forgot to confess\""]
["06:13,560","06:16,980","\"So I go to confession and I confess and then I get home you're like\""]
["06:16,980","06:20,740","\"No, no, I'm going to hell\""]
["06:21,500","06:27,500","\"Really? Yeah. I think it's kind of evil. It is kind of evil. Yeah, that's scary.\""]
["06:27,500","06:33,500","\"I think the concept of damning someone to hell for not saying everything is kind of fun.\""]
["06:33,500","06:39,500","\"We're not telling a priest or... I think there's gun and bad to everything, but that's pretty stupid.\""]
["06:39,500","06:46,500","\"You know what I love? I love how the Irish movie, how they portrayed it when it was in the confession.\""]
["06:46,500","06:49,500","\"The Banshees of Inisherin? Yeah, do you remember what I'm talking about? Yeah.\""]
["06:49,500","06:50,500","\"What did you say?\""]
["06:50,500","06:53,060","\"I forget it was really funny.\""]
["06:53,060","06:54,060","\"The mutilation part.\""]
["06:54,060","06:55,060","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["06:55,060","06:56,060","\"That times 10.\""]
["06:56,060","06:59,500","\"No, I was like, oh, fuck you.\""]
["06:59,500","07:00,740","\"The priest is like, fuck you.\""]
["07:00,740","07:02,980","\"Some priests are weird.\""]
["07:02,980","07:05,060","\"I feel like I just made me this.\""]
["07:05,060","07:06,420","\"It seemed very Irish.\""]
["07:06,420","07:08,820","\"I luckily had a nice priest growing up.\""]
["07:08,820","07:09,820","\"They weren't like that?\""]
["07:09,820","07:10,820","\"No.\""]
["07:10,820","07:11,820","\"Oh, no.\""]
["07:11,820","07:14,220","\"Every priest I dealt with growing up was, it seemed like just a nice guy.\""]
["07:14,220","07:15,700","\"Oh, that's sweet.\""]
["07:15,700","07:16,700","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:16,700","07:19,460","\"But there was one guy from Wexford that was famous for being a mega.\""]
["07:19,460","07:20,660","\"Are you serious?\""]
["07:20,660","07:21,940","\"His name is Father Fortune.\""]
["07:21,940","07:22,820","\"Did he get in trouble?\""]
["07:22,820","07:24,420","\"No, he died before he got in trouble.\""]
["07:24,420","07:25,940","\"So they're all just like cool with him?\""]
["07:25,940","07:27,140","\"Well not...\""]
["07:27,140","07:29,380","\"As long as he said his Hail Mary's before he died.\""]
["07:29,380","07:31,140","\"No, he got away with it for so long,\""]
["07:31,140","07:36,020","\"but he used to literally send kids out and like get them drugs and then worse when they got back.\""]
["07:36,020","07:38,580","\"So he was not a good priest.\""]
["07:38,580","07:40,740","\"I would consider him a not good priest.\""]
["07:40,740","07:41,860","\"He's an evil priest.\""]
["07:41,860","07:44,100","\"I would even call him the yeast of priests.\""]
["07:44,100","07:47,460","\"Ugh, it's poor guy.\""]
["07:47,460","07:49,460","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:49,460","07:50,460","\"Poor guy!\""]
["07:50,460","07:52,460","\"No, I mean the children.\""]
["07:52,460","07:53,460","\"*laughs*\""]
["07:53,460","07:55,460","\"Poor guy.\""]
["07:55,460","07:57,460","\"Oh God, what's gonna happen?\""]
["07:57,460","08:00,460","\"He was gross.\""]
["08:00,460","08:01,460","\"Do you met him?\""]
["08:01,460","08:02,460","\"No, no, no.\""]
["08:02,460","08:03,460","\"Bicep pictures.\""]
["08:03,460","08:07,460","\"But then, right after all that news story came out, someone in my family got married,\""]
["08:07,460","08:10,460","\"and I remember the priest that married them looked exactly like him,\""]
["08:10,460","08:12,460","\"and it was all anyone could talk about.\""]
["08:12,460","08:13,460","\"That's so fucked up!\""]
["08:13,460","08:16,460","\"They were just like, \"\"Oh, the poor fella, he looks exactly like a photoshoot.\"\"\""]
