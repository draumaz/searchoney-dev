["05:05,820","05:06,980","\"- Black hackers?\""]
["05:06,980","05:10,100","\"- Yeah, and that's not a commentary on racial relations,\""]

["05:22,180","05:23,340","\"can you explain that for people?\""]
["05:23,340","05:24,380","\"'Cause I always found that,\""]
["05:24,380","05:26,140","\"that was why I included it as a concept,\""]
["05:26,140","05:27,700","\"'cause I always thought that was really fascinating.\""]
["05:27,700","05:29,620","\"- I mean, it's as simple as that,\""]
["05:29,620","05:34,060","\"like people were sick of the negative connotations\""]
["05:34,060","05:38,540","\"of the term hacker. So they invented the idea of like a white hat hacker is someone who\""]
["05:38,540","05:43,380","\"only use hacking, use hacking ethically. And if they break into someone's system, they\""]
["05:43,380","05:49,100","\"don't do it to actually like cause any damage. They go and they would inform the person of\""]
["05:49,100","05:51,780","\"the security flaw and maybe even advise them on how to fix it.\""]
["05:51,780","05:54,980","\"Yeah, they might be like like brought on to like test like how secure something is. Yeah.\""]
["05:54,980","05:58,060","\"So basically using their powers for good more or less. And then and then you've got your\""]
["05:58,060","06:03,180","\"gray hats, which people don't talk about, which are usually people that like they're\""]
["06:03,180","06:08,180","\"They're not destructive, but they're like the chaotic...\""]
["06:08,180","06:10,420","\"- Neutral, they hack the ladders.\""]
["06:10,420","06:12,140","\"- They don't really do much, they just do it.\""]
["06:12,140","06:14,860","\"- The challenge themselves, yeah, yeah, yeah.\""]
["06:14,860","06:15,700","\"- Wow.\""]
["06:15,700","06:17,940","\"- And then you've got your Black Hat Hatter\""]
["06:17,940","06:21,100","\"who are doing it for profit and want and destruction.\""]
["06:21,100","06:24,260","\"- Yeah, so all the, this little design thing we had\""]
["06:24,260","06:28,260","\"was that here, so the player character secretly\""]
["06:28,260","06:30,460","\"is a hacker, the other good guy characters don't know.\""]
["06:30,460","06:32,060","\"- And then there's Red Hat Linux.\""]
["06:32,060","06:34,420","\"And I have no idea what a red hat is.\""]
["06:34,420","06:35,900","\"It's just a really--\""]
["06:35,900","06:38,380","\"- That's a class in Fuddle Fantasy.\""]

["06:52,900","06:54,220","\"You're gonna break.\""]
["06:54,220","06:56,300","\"- I'm so stupid I can do anything great.\""]

["06:57,180","06:58,780","\"- Wow, Chris hasn't grown in 10 years,\""]
["06:58,780","07:00,340","\"still making fun of young kids\""]
["07:00,340","07:01,780","\"that just wanna live out their dreams.\""]
["07:01,780","07:07,980","\"Just like he did to me and look at me now. I lived out my dream. I help. What can I voice him?\""]
["07:07,980","07:10,780","\"Because put out the other person\""]
["07:10,780","07:13,280","\"Just mod everything\""]
["07:13,280","07:18,340","\"You want to spend like a year your life doing like a mod of this game you just voiced every character\""]
["07:18,340","07:21,180","\"Yes, sir. Hello, it's me. How far?\""]
["07:21,180","07:25,200","\"What would you make her a little song fine? Oh, do you make her prefer sound like?\""]
["07:25,200","07:27,200","\"I'm camera for it.\""]
["07:28,660","07:31,620","\"So like Raccoon just made it so that his term would get skipped\""]
["07:31,620","07:37,380","\"You have to like unhack him and then it makes a little like like a tarry style like mini game happen. Oh you hit you\""]
["07:37,380","07:38,700","\"Oh no\""]
["07:38,700","07:40,700","\"but uh yeah, so like the\""]
["07:40,700","07:46,180","\"What I did was the designs of all the like the villains that are like black hat hackers\""]
["07:46,180","07:51,220","\"I actually gave them black hats and a lot of people didn't catch on to that. That was like a design choice\""]
["07:51,220","07:57,540","\"So raccoons the only one here that counts is a black head. Yeah, the other two are like his underlings\""]
["07:57,540","08:03,960","\"They're like still in training and he just tried to hack us, but he failed because we're better than him and he's got balls\""]
["08:03,960","08:07,520","\"That's well listen. He does look at him\""]
["08:07,520","08:11,740","\"No, he's like a tech deck dude. He does look like a tech. Yeah\""]
["08:11,740","08:22,180","\"Originally he was gonna have a skateboard, but it was like too annoying to like do so I just gave him I just gave him the\""]
["08:22,180","08:25,140","\"lower skates and stuff\""]
["08:26,100","08:30,460","\"They ran yeah, it shook a doubt he's looking right at me\""]

["08:52,180","08:54,180","\"and I'm like, I can't afford this.\""]
["08:54,180","08:58,060","\"So I got, actually Morgan, who voiced the player character,\""]
["08:58,060","09:00,700","\"'cause I wanted kind of like a gender ambiguous kind of thing.\""]
["09:00,700","09:03,500","\"Like, it could be a little boy, it could be a girl, who knows.\""]
["09:03,500","09:06,220","\"Up to your discretion kind of thing.\""]
["09:06,220","09:08,580","\"But I actually love that in games when you can pick\""]

["09:18,340","09:20,500","\"would emote by just hopping up and down very violently.\""]
["09:20,500","09:21,340","\"- Yeah.\""]
["09:21,340","09:23,340","\"It kind of works. I like that.\""]
["09:23,340","09:30,340","\"I just, I don't know. It's funny because I didn't have the battles look that way because I wanted to have the animation look a little more elaborate, but for the overworld.\""]
["09:30,340","09:34,340","\"I just love the isometric style thing because Mario RPG did it.\""]
["09:34,340","09:36,340","\"Make him a battle network did it.\""]
