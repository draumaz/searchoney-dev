["13:19,960","13:22,880","\"You're not reloading instantly. It's still 30% faster\""]

["13:35,720","13:38,200","\"I think you should start a YouTube where you talk about guns and just say this\""]
["13:38,200","13:41,920","\"Think of it. Okay. Well think of it. We call it Corey's gun ran\""]
["13:41,920","13:47,440","\"Cult action hold on think of it this way think of it this way\""]
["13:47,440","13:51,320","\"You prick your finger and fall off a building if it's exactly two seconds long\""]
["13:51,320","13:55,200","\"You'll live if you land because you have two seconds over your viewers try this theory out\""]
["13:55,200","13:57,680","\"Well, they need to upgrade\""]
["14:00,520","14:04,440","\"I'm just thinking think of all the times being two second invulnerability would work\""]
["14:04,440","14:09,080","\"But then it would take longer than two seconds to jump off a building\""]
["14:09,080","14:13,800","\"No, you could prick your finger just as you're falling and then you'll have two seconds of invulnerability\""]
["14:13,800","14:16,120","\"If you fell from to Mississippi\""]
["14:16,120","14:22,280","\"Oh, get out of here. Where'd he go? He ran away is a bitch. You don't even ankle biter\""]
["14:22,280","14:28,600","\"Break it. What is gravity is it was like six meters per second acceleration or something like that\""]
["14:28,600","14:35,280","\"You're asking the rug motherfucker all right if you prick your finger as you're falling you would be you hurt yourself\""]
["14:35,280","14:39,440","\"But then you would land you'd be invincible. It wouldn't matter you wouldn't hurt yourself after you wouldn't feel\""]
["14:39,440","14:43,440","\"You could do you could like rob a bag or something because you just get you get shot\""]
["14:43,440","14:49,280","\"You have to think of how to use this I'm not saying like the way you could do is jump off like the third story of a mall\""]
["14:49,280","14:54,000","\"No, you could do a lot of things you could prick your hands. Okay gravity's 9.8 meters per second\""]
["14:54,000","14:56,000","\"No, it's a lot of things you could grab\""]
["14:56,000","15:03,080","\"You can break your finger grab two meters you can wire it put it together because you wouldn't get hurt after that. That's acceleration so\""]
["15:03,080","15:10,760","\"You start off. I guess yeah if you were going from zero in the first second on that snakes get the fuck out of me while you're talking\""]
["15:10,760","15:18,320","\"Oh fuck okay two seconds of invulnerability like how you could definitely use that to your advantage\""]
["15:18,320","15:22,720","\"You're not gonna be able to like rob a bank. It's not a superpower. It's not what I was saying\""]
["15:22,720","15:27,140","\"That was it yeah, it is two seconds of invulnerability from slightly hurting yourself\""]
["15:27,140","15:32,840","\"No, I got fucking oh, yeah, so yeah for yeah after two seconds\""]
["15:32,840","15:38,520","\"You're falling at 19.6 meters per second so after two seconds so not even within the two seconds or you're reaching full velocity\""]
["15:38,520","15:40,520","\"You break your finger before hitting the ground\""]
["15:40,520","15:50,320","\"Why would you do it to be okay to make money would you be like I'm gonna bet you guys I could survive the fall\""]
["15:50,320","15:55,840","\"You could if you wanted to that's a good way to like make bank sure you could be like I could survive this fall\""]
["15:55,840","15:57,840","\"I'm you'll die, but you could be a job\""]
["15:57,840","16:05,020","\"Or get incredible jumper dude. You can do a lot what I'm saying is like you're saying you already falling it almost 44 miles an hour\""]
["16:05,020","16:08,040","\"Second vulnerability\""]
["16:08,040","16:12,320","\"Hold up is two seconds so more I don't think the cut well. I mean yes the cut off for the ability\""]
["16:12,320","16:15,120","\"You'd have to injure yourself mid fall realistic\""]
["16:17,920","16:19,920","\"Oh Chris you fucked your ankle up\""]
["16:19,920","16:23,160","\"You need a piece of bear meat\""]
["16:23,160","16:29,820","\"Right now, yeah, because you're fucking your stamina drained right no he heard himself from a mountain\""]
["16:29,820","16:32,520","\"Oh wow, yeah your stamina super\""]
["16:32,520","16:35,480","\"Birds\""]
["16:35,480","16:43,040","\"Yeah, I think if well, I'm saying just eating heal your stamina at all I'm saying sure it would be great to reload your gun\""]
["16:43,320","16:49,060","\"Second faster, but I would personally choose the ability to the Chris does eating you feel you're\""]
["16:49,060","16:52,200","\"Ability in real life. Oh, let me try it would be good\""]
["16:52,200","16:56,180","\"But even the game first aid kid to heal in the game is stupid because it could slash you\""]
["16:56,180","17:04,180","\"Yeah, that's fixed your injured leg. I'm gonna heal\""]
["17:04,180","17:09,740","\"This is cool. So you get like perks right like you have a perk point and you can choose a worker that it just keeps going\""]
["17:09,920","17:17,200","\"So your game can be different each time you play. What is that ghost? I don't know, but now he's haunting the ammo crate\""]
["17:17,200","17:23,840","\"You got so much health you're not gonna know we haven't gotten into this\""]

["17:35,040","17:39,040","\"I don't like them. I feel like they should be more spread out to make it more difficult\""]
["17:39,040","17:44,780","\"I mean they seem to be spread out. They were just like in one area. I feel like they should be everywhere. I would hate that\""]
["17:44,780","17:46,960","\"Why?\""]
["17:46,960","17:51,960","\"It's a really aggressive and have a lot of HP. Yeah, and he almost killed me. I mean, it's kind of cool\""]
["17:51,960","17:55,580","\"I don't know look at this kind of cool and games are hard impossible to play\""]
["17:55,580","17:58,320","\"Wow\""]
["17:58,320","18:03,120","\"Gives you a real sense of urgency when you can't kill somebody with a single clip. We found a new thing\""]
