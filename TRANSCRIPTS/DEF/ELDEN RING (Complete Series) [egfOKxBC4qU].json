["05:10,080","05:17,820","\"You can rename him later. Yeah, this game doesn't lock you in on your design at all. There's multiple places where you in fact you\""]

["05:38,640","05:44,060","\"Yeah, I don't know how I feel about it honestly because this game does have cutscenes\""]
["05:44,060","05:49,180","\"Yeah, it's got plenty and it's got like really good-looking scenery. I actually kind of don't\""]
["05:49,180","05:52,020","\"Don't think this is a great first impression\""]
["05:52,020","05:58,020","\"But oh well, at least it gets the point across. There's a part in it. I like though the book of pretty pictures\""]
["05:58,020","06:03,380","\"Yeah, Queen Marica the eternal America. That's the country we ran\""]
["06:03,380","06:06,340","\"Lot Queen America\""]

["06:19,980","06:24,340","\"Is that really true? Yes, I mean that's why I assume why it is\""]
["06:24,340","06:28,380","\"These are very common. You're right\""]
["06:28,380","06:32,740","\"There is a character in this game start with R or G\""]
["06:32,780","06:38,120","\"There's a character in this game that lies about their name and then they reveal that their actual name\""]
["06:38,120","06:40,300","\"I'm not it's not a spoiler\""]
["06:40,300","06:47,140","\"They reveal their actual name is something else and I didn't even notice because they were so similar\""]

["07:28,640","07:30,640","\"Can't wait to stand before that thing.\""]
["07:30,640","07:34,980","\"- The Elden Lord of the Elden Rings.\""]
["07:34,980","07:39,320","\"- How come we never stand before things on this channel?\""]
["07:39,320","07:40,800","\"- We do.\""]
["07:40,800","07:42,400","\"- We usually sit before things.\""]
["07:42,400","07:45,720","\"- We stand before friendship, we stand before money,\""]
["07:45,720","07:48,280","\"we stand before corruption.\""]
["07:48,280","07:49,600","\"- Ooh.\""]

["07:53,800","07:55,560","\"I know it's gonna remove armor,\""]
["07:55,560","07:57,840","\"but we gotta just see his little face.\""]
["07:57,840","07:58,960","\"- Look at that guy.\""]
["07:58,960","08:00,400","\"- You should take his pants off too,\""]
["08:00,400","08:02,400","\"So we don't fat roll.\""]
["08:02,400","08:05,140","\"Oh, we don't. Okay, never mind.\""]
["08:05,140","08:09,200","\"Yeah, would they really build you with an overly heavy build from the start?\""]
["08:09,200","08:14,280","\"They might just to fuck with you. This guy's the coolest. I forgot you can jump. This is crazy.\""]
["08:14,280","08:19,420","\"Tominish finger. It's so weird because it feels like it's always been there to me.\""]
["08:19,420","08:22,380","\"But then it hasn't.\""]
["08:22,380","08:27,880","\"They also just change your flask button to square and it just seems like it's always been there.\""]
["08:28,520","08:35,520","\"Not really. Yeah, it's usually triangle, right? Yeah. Oh wait. No, I think you are right. Yeah, actually yeah, you're right\""]
["08:35,520","08:38,200","\"Wow, maybe I'm wrong. I don't know\""]
["08:38,200","08:44,920","\"It's the tree. I know I put it on triangle and Sekiro because it was fucking up on the D-pad and pissed me off\""]
["08:44,920","08:47,560","\"I changed it\""]
["08:47,560","08:49,840","\"for the better\""]
["08:49,840","08:54,120","\"When I first played Demon Souls, I remember when I was first playing it\""]
["08:54,120","08:57,980","\"You'd see like a spirit and a bloodstain every now and again, but now\""]
["08:57,980","09:04,680","\"It's like I feel like especially early on people are like jumping off cliffs and stuff to try to find secrets\""]
["09:04,680","09:11,680","\"Yeah, so I definitely I found a hallway where it's like nothing in this hallway could kill you and it had blood stains everywhere\""]
["09:11,680","09:14,600","\"But it had like kind of archways on the sides of it\""]
["09:14,600","09:21,500","\"So I assume what was happening was someone was jumping off repeatedly looking for weird secret holes and stuff\""]
["09:21,500","09:24,880","\"Makes sense because the game is pretty new. I love that you could jump\""]
["09:25,420","09:31,420","\"Always makes it seem more fun. You could jump in the old ones, but it was kind of finicky. It was awful\""]
["09:31,420","09:36,940","\"Yeah, I remember didn't Dark Souls two or three everything where if you ran and you you clicked in like the left\""]
["09:36,940","09:43,360","\"Yeah, I thought that was better. That's better. Yeah, the first one you had to like run and jump with the same button\""]
["09:43,360","09:46,300","\"Yeah, and roll with the same button. Oh\""]
["09:46,300","09:55,380","\"The what that fun a grafted son is just a crab fuck you\""]
["09:55,380","09:57,380","\"Can you guess yeah\""]
["09:57,380","10:01,940","\"Screamed you did screams you did I didn't even know that\""]
["10:01,940","10:08,300","\"Screamed up by a crab\""]
["10:08,300","10:15,060","\"Imagine going to the hospital and having to explain the nature of your injury after being screamed up by a crab\""]
["10:15,060","10:18,500","\"What hit you well nothing, but I did get screamed at my crap\""]
["10:18,500","10:23,480","\"And she's like there's there it happens to the best of us\""]
["10:23,980","10:30,980","\"This guy really is the coolest. I don't think I would rely on him to save the world or whatever we're doing. Look at those hairy fingers.\""]
["10:30,980","10:35,980","\"He does have little hairy fingers. He's a proper hobbit he is.\""]
["10:35,980","10:37,980","\"Proper hobbit!\""]
["10:37,980","10:39,980","\"I smell my fingers.\""]

["10:50,980","10:53,580","\"He's very lucky to have died to the crab.\""]
["10:53,580","10:55,980","\"- We should get horses.\""]
["10:55,980","11:00,980","\"- We should ride them into this room\""]
["11:00,980","11:04,080","\"at the beginning of every recording.\""]
["11:04,080","11:06,380","\"- The Elden Ring.\""]
["11:06,380","11:08,340","\"- Why do they keep saying that?\""]
["11:08,340","11:10,540","\"Why do they think they know me like that?\""]
["11:10,540","11:13,020","\"- The Golden Order.\""]
["11:13,020","11:15,700","\"- She's been meaning to violate the Golden Order\""]
["11:15,700","11:17,380","\"for some time now, I think.\""]
["11:17,380","11:20,340","\"- She can violate my Golden Hole.\""]
["11:20,340","11:23,780","\"-Mm. -Lile.\""]

["11:31,060","11:32,820","\"Do you think that's ever gonna happen?\""]
["11:32,820","11:34,060","\"I don't think Dark Souls would work.\""]
["11:34,060","11:36,420","\"-Oh, no. I think it'll happen and it's gonna suck.\""]
["11:36,420","11:38,900","\"-I think it would. It could work as a movie,\""]
["11:38,900","11:41,540","\"but yeah, they'll fuck it up. -I think it might be like\""]
["11:41,540","11:44,900","\"a Netflix show or something, but even then, I don't know if it would.\""]
["11:44,900","11:47,940","\"-U.A. Bollages to direct his first Netflix show.\""]

["01:24:15,540","01:24:19,700","\"He's gonna do the run at you thing one and two. There you go. Fuck\""]
["01:24:19,700","01:24:26,900","\"Okay, it's always a good delay before the second one, but yeah once you get the timing down. It's not too hard to deal with\""]
["01:24:26,900","01:24:30,540","\"He's gonna do the oh damn it. Oh\""]
["01:24:30,540","01:24:37,660","\"My god, he has one move that he hasn't used on you yet that is absolute bullshit\""]
["01:24:37,660","01:24:43,220","\"It's basically a one-hit kill. It's like one of those moves where he hits you like five times\""]

["01:25:12,500","01:25:17,940","\"God damn it I had a little opening you probably could have but whatever\""]
["01:25:17,940","01:25:21,940","\"There's a chance he was gonna pull out his little daggies\""]
