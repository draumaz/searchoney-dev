["11:18,280","11:23,880","\"It's like designed to irritate a child brain, but an adult brain can tackle it pretty fucking easy\""]
["11:23,880","11:31,200","\"Okay, you know what I think what do you think I think as an adult? I don't have time for running around dungeons\""]
["11:31,200","11:33,440","\"right\""]
["11:33,440","11:40,000","\"So you don't know my opinion. What's your opinion? My opinion is that it's wrong. It's clearly wrong. It's the wrong opinion\""]
["11:40,000","11:47,860","\"But for my uh, ADHD ridden brain, I think I would prefer it if the dungeon was like a top-down view and it was more of just a puzzle\""]
["11:47,860","11:52,260","\"Where you instantly move shit around like instantly and Link was just like whizzing around really fast\""]
["11:52,260","11:54,900","\"You're right. That sounds actually horrible\""]
["11:54,900","12:01,200","\"It's horrible in an adventure sense cuz now it feels more like a game and less like an adventure\""]
["12:01,200","12:03,860","\"but uh, I\""]
["12:04,260","12:08,020","\"Just don't have time for running around door to door and getting lost and I just don't care\""]
["12:08,020","12:12,840","\"You have time for running around whore to whore. Yeah getting your dick lost inside their guts. Yeah\""]
["12:12,840","12:17,980","\"But it does that completely like destroys the feel of like running around a world and having an adventure\""]
["12:17,980","12:22,580","\"Right when it comes to those puzzles the puzzles are just too annoying sometimes like in that dungeon\""]
["12:22,580","12:29,500","\"I'm turning this on because I free and maybe go all the way down to that other room and see if that fucking steam will go to hell\""]
["12:29,500","12:33,980","\"Okay, go to hell. Yeah, so in that oh no, that's that's where it was\""]
["12:33,980","12:38,180","\"That's on and that's still on now, but I went past it already. So I need to go past it here\""]
["12:38,180","12:42,780","\"I'm gonna okay. I'm gonna get the freak out of here and go up the stairs and look for the key\""]
["12:42,780","12:44,780","\"Because I need to get a key\""]
["12:44,780","12:46,780","\"Hang out with my bro\""]
["12:46,780","12:49,260","\"Ooh fat face\""]
["12:49,260","12:53,660","\"What do you know Chris?\""]
["12:53,660","12:58,020","\"I don't know if you played any more breath of the wild since we played it on the channel\""]
["12:58,020","12:59,460","\"B-O-T-W?\""]
["12:59,460","13:02,580","\"But that's kind of how the dungeons in that one work.\""]
["13:02,580","13:04,580","\"You just said it was the worst idea ever.\""]
["13:04,580","13:06,220","\"It is a bad idea.\""]
["13:06,220","13:08,500","\"The dungeons are not the high point of that game.\""]
["13:08,500","13:10,580","\"Uh, but you know what?\""]
["13:10,580","13:11,580","\"Lyle?\""]
["13:11,580","13:13,660","\"You know what? Lyle? You know why? Lyle?\""]
["13:13,660","13:14,420","\"Why's that?\""]
["13:14,420","13:15,940","\"'Cause they're just like, aren't they all like,\""]
["13:15,940","13:17,380","\"they all look the same visually\""]
["13:17,380","13:19,460","\"and they don't have any like soul to them?\""]
["13:19,460","13:22,820","\"They look the same and then every dungeon has like a thing\""]
["13:22,820","13:25,700","\"where you can open up your little legend of Zelda iPad.\""]
["13:25,700","13:29,460","\"Yeah, and like move part of the dungeon\""]
["13:29,460","13:34,400","\"And they all kind of have like a gimmick that's kind of like what you described\""]
["13:34,400","13:39,880","\"Where basically you just go into a menu and like be like I want this to move and then it moves\""]
["13:39,880","13:44,660","\"Yeah, that's good. And it's not the worst thing. Oh my god. It's not the worst thing like I said it was\""]
["13:44,660","13:50,340","\"I never got that fur. I still need to play it. Zach's been wanting to play it properly. So I've been waiting\""]
["13:50,340","13:53,980","\"You've been biting your time. Yeah\""]
["13:54,420","13:57,860","\"Now that game is really cool. It's got a really nice sandbox\""]
["13:57,860","14:06,440","\"Even in the old Zelda games, I prefer that camera angle just because it suits puzzles better than being down on Link's level\""]
["14:06,440","14:08,440","\"Just top down. Yeah\""]
["14:08,440","14:13,280","\"That'd be kind of cool if it on the open world in 3d's all the games\""]
["14:13,280","14:16,760","\"It was like 3d but then when as soon as you enter a dungeon and went to that view\""]
["14:16,760","14:19,200","\"It makes you cry\""]
["14:19,200","14:23,700","\"That is a that is a weird take. I don't know what to even think of it\""]
["14:23,700","14:25,700","\"I don't know I think that would work. I\""]
["14:25,700","14:32,100","\"Don't think like I also would be a bad game. I just think people would be like that's kind of weird and I don't like it\""]
["14:32,100","14:37,780","\"That's completely fair if it wasn't a Zelda game and you just made a game that did that isn't top-down Zelda literally\""]
["14:37,780","14:39,300","\"Just how the classics play yeah\""]
["14:39,300","14:39,700","\"Yeah\""]
["14:39,700","14:43,860","\"But I'm saying that if you had a 3d Zelda game like win waker and as soon as you entered a dungeon\""]
["14:43,860","14:47,380","\"It was just top-down people would probably be like I don't like this camera angle\""]
["14:47,380","14:52,140","\"It's not I don't feel like I'm really in the world anymore, but it would make solving puzzles a lot easier\""]
["14:52,140","14:58,560","\"I don't know also that move in link links awakening or not links awakening a link to the past where you can just run\""]
["14:58,560","15:04,340","\"That would help a lot too. Oh, yeah, I think around real fast. Oh shit. I think it would come up here\""]
["15:04,340","15:09,200","\"I'm fully aware that these ideas are probably terrible\""]
["15:09,200","15:15,980","\"What they're in like I yeah, they are they are kind of interesting like that's not even it's not even like a bad\""]
["15:15,980","15:17,180","\"I\""]
["15:17,180","15:21,620","\"Wouldn't describe that as a bad idea. It's just weird. It's just different, huh? Yeah\""]
["15:21,620","15:27,800","\"Makes you think really it's a noggin scratcher something. I've kind of learned what it comes to games is that\""]
["15:27,800","15:30,140","\"I\""]
["15:30,140","15:34,380","\"Used to think of things feeling gamey as being a bad thing, but as soon as you're playing a game\""]
["15:34,380","15:36,940","\"Yeah, no as soon as you're playing a game. It doesn't really matter\""]
["15:36,940","15:39,940","\"You're gonna feel like that anyway, so you might as well make it gamey\""]
["15:39,940","15:48,140","\"It it kind of depends on the game to me. Yeah like something like doom eternal is a little too gamey for me\""]
["15:48,220","15:54,900","\"Never worry that one. I mean did you play 2016 kind of the same thing? I don't like all the all the fucking like\""]
["15:54,900","16:01,700","\"Little blue glowing like plus signs coming out of guys and stuff like that kind of pulls me out of it\""]
["16:01,700","16:07,020","\"If you can like kind of camouflage them with stuff that makes you forget that that helps\""]
["16:07,020","16:12,300","\"Yeah, like if you can make it look visually less gamey cool, but at the end of the day it is still gamey\""]
["16:12,300","16:16,880","\"Depending on the mechanics. I actually really like that. I think I think doom 16\""]
["16:17,660","16:21,580","\"I think 16 would be like too disturbing with like the violence if it didn't have that stuff\""]
["16:21,580","16:23,900","\"See I wanted to be disturbing with the violence though\""]
["16:23,900","16:29,460","\"I think it's nice and funny when they glow orange. Oh shit. I get the fuck out of here\""]
["16:29,460","16:32,780","\"Like I know a lot of people\""]
["16:32,780","16:40,160","\"Like that game and I I want to really really bad. Yeah, and I just I can't I think there's a balance like there's gait like\""]
["16:40,160","16:43,680","\"MMOs when everything has like a million\""]
["16:44,340","16:47,740","\"Dialogue boxes surrounding it that really annoys me. Yeah\""]
["16:47,740","16:54,840","\"There you go, we turned our big kingdom hard skis now the ship works again. You unlock the whole ship\""]
["16:54,840","17:03,140","\"Unless I evil ship controls\""]
["17:03,140","17:09,860","\"I love you. I love Jill - I think she's kind of\""]
["17:11,860","17:15,180","\"I don't know what the incentive function of this mechanism was\""]
["17:15,180","17:19,860","\"If you restore the backup power on the ship, we then drown you\""]
["17:19,860","17:28,260","\"Learn how boats work. Oh, you're fucked. Good night. Dave. I think the terrorists are doing something mean\""]
["17:28,260","17:34,740","\"But we're gaining lots of water\""]
["17:36,580","17:44,280","\"Was that B.S. Yeah, I agree. I can't fucking wait for our before we make I know it might not be as good as the original\""]
["17:44,280","17:46,280","\"But I'm still excited for it\""]
["17:46,280","17:51,440","\"They better not cut out my favorite part of the game, which is looking up a giant is\""]
["17:51,440","18:04,040","\"Jumped down the huge tower on lands trecline your gun if you go to revenge if you get resident evil for VR\""]
["18:04,040","18:08,600","\"What is to stop you from getting on the ground and like you're out yeah?\""]
["18:08,600","18:10,680","\"Well that but like also like\""]
["18:10,680","18:17,200","\"Do they physically control for that the shoot it sucks real bad cut that out actually she just starts farting in your mouth\""]
["18:17,200","18:21,340","\"And the smell of receptor in the steam thing starts filling your nose a horrible shit, so\""]
["18:21,340","18:26,660","\"This is a full retail price game or maybe I'll wait for a sale\""]
["18:28,920","18:36,680","\"If that entices you well, thanks cap go I just got you a sale. I think in the oculus version they cut out dirtier parts of the game\""]
["18:36,680","18:45,680","\"Really? Yeah, you mean the fun Japanese parts? Yeah, but not now even Japan is starting to be like we do not want to offend our customers\""]
["18:45,680","18:47,920","\"Like shut up just fucking defend us. I\""]
["18:47,920","18:54,040","\"Think Japanese people are starting to sell more to Westerners because there's money to be made to sell to one million white people\""]
["18:54,040","18:56,040","\"I know but uh\""]
["18:56,400","19:05,400","\"You know when will they learn that we actually like weird giant boobs and silly finishes listening to that stupid side of the planet?\""]
["19:05,400","19:11,500","\"I'm starting to see people go on Twitter and say stuff like we don't need this type of character anymore\""]
["19:11,500","19:16,700","\"And it's not a rush. Yes, we do. It's like I like I like old man laughs at pornography\""]
["19:16,700","19:20,880","\"I'm sorry. I'm sorry if you're a woman and you're the butt of the joke in that instance\""]
["19:20,880","19:24,800","\"We're funny woman equals funny, but did that guy just trip? What the fuck happened?\""]
["19:25,360","19:29,720","\"He's got so excited he passed out. Yeah, he started thinking about what master roshy thinks\""]
["19:29,720","19:31,880","\"Yeah, and he had a nosebleen it shot him backwards\""]
