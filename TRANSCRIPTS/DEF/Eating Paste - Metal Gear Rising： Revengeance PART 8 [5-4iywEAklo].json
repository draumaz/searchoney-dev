["02:08,520","02:12,880","\"I think that's coach. Eames fault - if I'm being honest. Yeah, that was a choice\""]
["02:13,680","02:19,920","\"I definitely feel it when I go into blade mode. I don't really feel it too much otherwise blade mode. Yeah this thing\""]
["02:19,920","02:25,280","\"It's called blade mode. No, it's not that was really cool. You slashed it nothing. Yeah\""]
["02:25,280","02:30,320","\"Yeah, so I'm playing with like a split second delay if I'm bad\""]
["02:30,320","02:34,760","\"Everything is that's fault and none of it's my fault actually. Yeah, it's Kojima's fault\""]
["02:34,760","02:37,560","\"Do you remember Kojima at the game awards?\""]
["02:37,560","02:42,600","\"Which time there's so many iconic ones it was when he was walking down the platforms were falling\""]

["02:46,520","02:53,560","\"Did he yeah, it was like they set him up with like an epic entrance and then he just kind of spoiled it\""]
["02:53,560","02:53,880","\"Yeah\""]
["02:53,880","02:58,680","\"Yeah, it was like it was LED lights making it look like the ground was collapsing from underneath them\""]
["02:58,680","03:02,300","\"But he walked on they walked past the platform and into the darkness\""]
["03:11,120","03:15,280","\"It was funny, you know we should start the video game shame awards\""]
["03:15,280","03:22,120","\"The game shames yeah the video game shame awards we could call them the shames for sure. Yes\""]
["03:22,120","03:26,540","\"That is perfect. Who would you give your first shame you to I?\""]
["03:26,540","03:28,920","\"Don't know\""]
["03:28,920","03:33,980","\"You I feel like you've given this more thought than I have I really haven't I actually want to think now\""]
["03:33,980","03:40,440","\"What deserves the video game shame award? I I was trying to think of like some kind of some kind of pun with the name\""]
["03:40,440","03:43,320","\"but the first one who came to mind was actually dead so\""]
["03:43,320","03:46,680","\"I was totally gonna say Shami Winehouse\""]
["03:46,680","03:48,440","\"I think it's been long enough to where I can\""]
["03:48,440","03:50,440","\"She's not a video game, lol\""]
["03:50,440","03:54,200","\"Well, she can't be now and isn't that a shame?\""]
["03:54,200","03:56,440","\"You're right, you can't make games about dead people\""]
["03:56,440","03:58,440","\"Especially not watching\""]
["03:58,440","04:00,440","\"He'll be featured in the Shami\""]
["04:00,440","04:02,440","\"Yeah, it would come full circle\""]
["04:02,440","04:06,440","\"What if we did do like a live award show called the Shami's?\""]
["04:06,440","04:08,440","\"Like, why not run with this?\""]
["04:08,440","04:14,080","\"with this yeah no I think it's a great idea like no one takes the actual award\""]
["04:14,080","04:21,920","\"show seriously so why would we have to we could just we should we could what do\""]
["04:21,920","04:27,040","\"you call it showcase the most shameful moments of the video game awards I feel\""]
["04:27,040","04:30,340","\"like there's already a lot of videos that the shame sounds like it would be\""]
["04:30,340","04:34,480","\"something like somebody like angry Joe or something would do or it's like the\""]
["04:34,480","04:39,640","\"worst video games I don't want to do that I want to do a more subtle thing I\""]
["04:39,640","04:42,640","\"Just would want the main policy to be like\""]
["04:42,640","04:49,360","\"Try not to pick up people for like budgetary related stuff, but anything else is free game\""]
["04:49,360","04:55,120","\"Why do I pick on them for budget stuff though, cuz then you could be like you don't have money\""]

["05:03,680","05:08,480","\"So they're rich and they can punch down at everybody and you can make up an award for literally anything\""]
["05:08,480","05:15,000","\"Yeah, you get full control over any personal bias like you can just integrate into the shamies\""]
["05:15,000","05:19,260","\"And you can just fake awards be like the shitty graphics of the year file fantasy remake\""]
["05:19,260","05:23,320","\"Yeah, then you can fucking point at a guy in the crowd and say get have him killed\""]
["05:23,320","05:29,680","\"You didn't do anything about it you piece of shit I\""]
