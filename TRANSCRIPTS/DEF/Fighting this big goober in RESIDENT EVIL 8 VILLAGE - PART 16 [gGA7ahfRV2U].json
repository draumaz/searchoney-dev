["11:55,220","12:02,180","\"You know the same rules still apply when you die you're dead you might as well just treat it like a video game and walk around naked\""]
["12:02,180","12:04,820","\"Why why not?\""]
["12:04,820","12:09,660","\"It's not real, but it's as real as is things are ever gonna get\""]
["12:09,660","12:14,900","\"So what it's not as if like that's like saying this game is as real as things are ever gonna get\""]
["12:14,900","12:19,340","\"I mean if you could prove it was like the matrix and you had like a real physical body in a real world\""]
["12:19,340","12:21,620","\"Then yeah, I guess I'd have some curiosity about that\""]
["12:21,620","12:25,220","\"But if it's just like no, you're just a computer program\""]
["12:25,220","12:30,220","\"You're just like a line of code in a computer program if we're just a line of computer program\""]
["12:30,220","12:32,620","\"We might as well just spread our ass in public and not care\""]
["12:33,220","12:37,780","\"But why why not because this is the realest shit's ever gonna get for you\""]
["12:37,780","12:40,380","\"And it's a have all the same\""]
["12:40,380","12:46,380","\"Consequences in this computer program that you would in in what you would otherwise call the real world\""]
["12:46,380","12:51,380","\"So why would you act any differently? What is the consequence? Oh, no, I'm shunned by code\""]
["12:51,380","12:55,100","\"You're but but that code is your reality\""]
["12:55,100","13:03,000","\"The point is Chris is saying if you discovered that our whole world\""]
["13:03,000","13:07,960","\"was a simulation you might as well just like go walk around naked and like commit crimes\""]
["13:07,960","13:12,920","\"and I'm like yes it's still your reality whether it's like technically real or not.\""]
["13:12,920","13:15,800","\"Yeah but you might as well just like walk around naked that's all I'm saying.\""]
["13:15,800","13:22,760","\"That's a good fucking point. Also if you're experiencing consciousness within coded reality\""]
["13:22,760","13:27,400","\"you can only assume that you're the operator right so nothing can really happen to you when you die.\""]
["13:27,400","13:31,960","\"Yeah so why would you assume you're the operator you're just one of the pro you're just because\""]
["13:31,960","13:33,120","\"- Because you're conscious.\""]
["13:33,120","13:35,320","\"- You're just an application.\""]
["13:35,320","13:36,760","\"No, you're not conscious.\""]
["13:36,760","13:38,840","\"- Well, I guess if you think consciousness is a myth\""]
["13:38,840","13:41,520","\"then yeah, which you know what, that's a good point.\""]
["13:41,520","13:43,240","\"- I'm saying if you're really a program\""]
["13:43,240","13:45,960","\"in a simulation, yeah, consciousness would therefore\""]
["13:45,960","13:49,500","\"be a myth, you're just some complicated algorithm.\""]
["13:49,500","13:52,080","\"- Tomar, if I found out for certainty,\""]
["13:52,080","13:55,600","\"I was just code, I would have a fucking wild field day.\""]
["13:55,600","13:58,520","\"I would drink water and spark from the neck and ears.\""]
["13:58,520","14:00,480","\"- It wouldn't make any difference.\""]
["14:00,480","14:02,480","\"It would be awesome\""]
["14:02,480","14:05,960","\"You got the Giants challenge. Did you just put your baby in that?\""]
["14:05,960","14:09,660","\"Yes, no, no, you put your seat in women and create babies\""]
["14:09,660","14:13,800","\"No, but that the parts of the last one that you fucked up\""]
["14:13,800","14:16,640","\"No, no, no, you fuck women\""]
["14:16,640","14:25,120","\"I'm saying if you burn the baby if it's in there too long, right? No, no, no you burn CDs, dude, okay\""]
["14:29,000","14:32,920","\"Let's say a woman does a little bit of magic. Can you burn her?\""]
["14:32,920","14:35,660","\"Yes, okay\""]
["14:35,660","14:42,300","\"You're describing a wish yeah, yeah, that was kind of what I was getting at but I wanted you to say it not me\""]
["14:42,300","14:44,680","\"My god, that's so hot\""]
["14:44,680","14:47,120","\"That's the good half\""]
["14:47,120","14:53,600","\"You guys look like they would have said OAO OAO a lot in life\""]
["14:53,600","14:58,120","\"But now they're just big stone guys that said it shares put your chalice on it\""]
["14:58,120","15:00,120","\"You can't put your phallus on it dude\""]
["15:00,120","15:07,640","\"Put your giant phallus on that I carried that up here really you're kind of strong this game stupid\""]
["15:07,640","15:12,120","\"Okay\""]
["15:12,120","15:20,560","\"Where's your new friend I should love that you went through the entire like that whole section of the game just\""]
["15:20,560","15:25,680","\"Just to raise a bridge just to do something that could have been like traversed with like a motorcycle\""]
["15:26,200","15:28,200","\"and what kind of like a ramp.\""]
["15:28,200","15:31,200","\"I would have liked to see that more.\""]
["15:31,200","15:34,200","\"They should have had that happen as a ramp goes up\""]
["15:34,200","15:36,200","\"and then get out of motorcycle and jump in.\""]
["15:36,200","15:41,200","\"I mean, there's like a million ways you could just cross a big gap like that.\""]
["15:41,200","15:44,200","\"I can think of four.\""]
["15:44,200","15:45,200","\"But some millions maybe.\""]
["15:45,200","15:51,200","\"Somehow your daughter stuck in a giant stone pillar was the key to opening that bridge.\""]
["15:51,200","15:54,200","\"Seems like you could just apply weight to this fucking thing\""]
["15:54,200","15:55,200","\"and it would have done this.\""]
["15:55,200","15:58,040","\"That's always the problem with video games in it.\""]
["15:58,040","15:59,180","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["15:59,180","16:05,380","\"In order for them to make that whole situation make sense, they need to put a giant fucking canyon going all the way down.\""]
["16:05,380","16:09,560","\"To be fair, this is as down as I've ever seen it.\""]
["16:09,560","16:19,860","\"Why are you listening to this guy now?\""]
["16:19,860","16:21,620","\"Yeah, that's really stupid.\""]

["16:24,700","16:30,860","\"There was never this many moments like this to make just go like come on what why I kind of like it though\""]
["16:30,860","16:33,340","\"It's silly. It is funny\""]
["16:33,340","16:36,060","\"It's funny that you're listening to this idiot\""]
["16:36,060","16:42,780","\"I do kind of miss Resident Evil what it made me actually like scared and I'm like screaming like a second ago\""]
["16:42,780","16:47,700","\"No, but like that's like I mean of the the story and like like what's actually happening hmm\""]
["16:48,540","16:50,540","\"Heisenberg's factory.\""]
