["00:38,640","00:40,640","\"It probably cost a lot.\""]
["00:40,640","00:43,640","\"And then you have to find three friends that you can attach the dragons to\""]
["00:43,640","00:47,640","\"so when they die, it'll raise a staircase and also raise a treasure chest.\""]
["00:47,640","00:49,640","\"Would they not feel kind of bad, though?\""]
["00:49,640","00:51,640","\"You don't tell them about it.\""]

["06:25,360","06:27,200","\"The sample, I suppose, is back where it belongs.\""]
["06:27,200","06:30,320","\"I had hoped that the whole matter could be resolved without troubling the Lord.\""]
["06:30,320","06:34,240","\"However, as long as the sample is safe, we can all rejoice for our time as nearly at hand.\""]
["06:34,240","06:36,080","\"Now that the sample is back in our safe hands.\""]
["06:36,080","06:37,200","\"In quotes every time.\""]
["06:37,200","06:38,880","\"Yeah, it's not really a sample.\""]
["06:38,880","06:42,240","\"It'll be a bit more difficult for that troublesome woman to get it.\""]

["07:04,160","07:06,480","\"Wait, I think there's one more room in here that we didn't see.\""]
["07:06,480","07:12,700","\"I can understand why they don't like Ashley, but what did I ever do? I've only been good to them. What the hell?\""]

["07:25,460","07:28,760","\"They won me over it won't be over\""]
["07:28,760","07:31,920","\"Chinese Julian likes the spookies shoot\""]

["08:47,420","08:50,580","\"me want to play it again it's a great game I forgot how much I liked a lot\""]
["08:50,580","08:56,180","\"about it. There's a reason why everyone says it's the greatest action game of our age.\""]
["08:56,180","09:00,340","\"You know, Mikami, you figured things out. You made some really good action games.\""]
["09:00,340","09:03,700","\"Yeah, you're not so shit after all, huh? You make some good stuff.\""]
["09:03,700","09:11,380","\"They're gonna attack. Oh, whoa, Jesus. Actually, why didn't you do a battle with me?\""]
["09:11,380","09:13,700","\"It was it was literally a ghost.\""]
["09:16,580","09:22,420","\"It turns to aim at you and then it fell apart. I know kind of silly, huh?\""]
["09:22,420","09:29,460","\"Grazed me a little there on my insides. I don't know if I can take this game seriously. You don't. That's the last thing you should do.\""]
["09:29,460","09:34,220","\"Yeah, you probably shouldn't be taking a tooth to a wacky game, Julie. What's this?\""]
["09:34,220","09:42,940","\"When would you say Resident Evil became pure action game? You're in trouble. I know people point to six for that, but obviously four was a starting point for that too. Oh\""]
["09:42,940","09:46,180","\"heavens, oh, I've never seen\""]
["09:46,180","09:51,200","\"Any other previous one so I wouldn't know I don't remember a day watch out\""]

["10:13,620","10:14,580","\"I'm supposed to annoy them.\""]
["10:14,580","10:16,180","\"Probably not because it doesn't look like you.\""]
["10:16,180","10:17,260","\"And when they get irritated, they go,\""]
