["11:03,340","11:09,620","\"Oh, no, what my rampant crazy LSD episodes is never interact with anything that looks like sharp\""]
["11:09,620","11:16,120","\"Or like dark that's a good point. That's actually a really good rule of thumb. I think that's usually leads to worse things\""]
["11:16,120","11:21,180","\"Okay, because like when okay, I'm gonna tell this story when I did\""]
["11:21,180","11:23,780","\"Mushrooms I wasn't in a\""]
["11:23,780","11:28,080","\"Concentrated environment and I didn't understand what I was doing\""]
["11:28,080","11:32,420","\"But anything that was dark like when everyone was doing mushrooms\""]
["11:32,420","11:35,460","\"It was like everyone was like all it was like colors were really bright. It was like this\""]
["11:35,460","11:38,780","\"Yeah, it was like pretty and bright, but anything that was dark\""]
["11:39,300","11:45,220","\"Emitted this like really dark aura and looked really uncomfortable. Yeah, and it made you really uncomfortable\""]
["11:45,220","11:52,060","\"So because you enter the purple spike everything was like really dark and fucking creepy so you this place comes up a lot\""]
["11:52,060","11:54,060","\"Yeah, it's kind of a shithole\""]
["11:54,060","12:00,380","\"I think like you kind of were looking for like special objects to interact with to like get to your true objective. Oh, yeah\""]
["12:00,380","12:04,260","\"So look for bright things not dark. Look for something like yeah like\""]
["12:05,140","12:09,760","\"Yeah, so the red pill sign was pretty yes, that was effective over here\""]
["12:09,760","12:13,920","\"Got your attention see that's what you need to do because that's what you do when you have an LSD\""]
["12:13,920","12:20,880","\"Or when you're gonna core you follow the colors. I'm not I'm not just coming to play. It's your left Chris. Yeah\""]
["12:20,880","12:22,880","\"I know I'm serious like\""]
["12:22,880","12:29,480","\"It's really hard to explain because it's not something any it's not something somebody would know unless they actually did like any kind of like\""]
["12:29,480","12:32,740","\"We're getting new music LSD style drugs like mushrooms\""]
["12:32,740","12:38,700","\"Mmm, but like anyone who doesn't do it with you doesn't experience it as well. Okay, so look for something bright\""]
["12:38,700","12:44,540","\"I said mirrors this kind of like creepier like that like that Chris go forward go through there because it's bright\""]
["12:44,540","12:48,080","\"I'm like and look at that building right there that red one is different from all the other ones\""]
["12:48,080","12:55,020","\"Actually, it's not okay. Well look you see the moon is it mirrors this like land weirder this time\""]
["12:55,020","13:01,700","\"Have you played this before? Yeah, only a little bit and I didn't understand and I'm still trying to understand only but a\""]
