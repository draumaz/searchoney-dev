["00:01,600","00:03,600","\"It's the last fun stage until I have to start fanning.\""]
["00:03,600","00:05,200","\"It looks really fun, Corey.\""]
["00:05,200","00:08,080","\"Chris, I pause at a challenge to yee.\""]

["00:11,680","00:17,760","\"I challenge you to put Kazoo in a track for Bulbo and try to make it actually like sound sick.\""]
["00:17,760","00:19,440","\"Is Kazoo a 90s instrument?\""]
["00:19,440","00:20,400","\"I don't know.\""]
["00:20,400","00:21,680","\"I don't know how long that's been around.\""]
["00:21,680","00:23,200","\"I assume that's been around for a while.\""]
["00:23,200","00:26,560","\"It's even if it's that cold because I bet something like this.\""]
["00:26,560","00:27,440","\"I could do that, Lyle.\""]
["00:28,480","00:29,920","\"I genuinely think you could.\""]
["00:29,920","00:31,680","\"I'm gonna call it the Lyle song.\""]
["00:31,680","00:32,680","\"Good.\""]
["00:32,680","00:34,520","\"Because it was your idea.\""]
["00:34,520","00:36,640","\"I'm gonna call it Lyle's idea.\""]
["00:36,640","00:37,680","\"Yeah, for context.\""]
["00:37,680","00:39,120","\"But I was already by course.\""]
["00:39,120","00:40,080","\"All the benefits.\""]
["00:40,080","00:41,200","\"That's fair.\""]

["00:43,440","00:45,040","\"Thanks, bro.\""]
["00:45,040","00:46,480","\"That's collaboration right there.\""]
["00:46,480","00:47,600","\"Hell yeah.\""]
["00:47,600","00:49,120","\"Where one person gets all the crap.\""]
["00:49,120","00:52,240","\"Oh my god.\""]
["00:52,240","00:53,520","\"This level's so long.\""]
["00:53,520","00:54,240","\"What's wrong with it?\""]
["00:54,240","00:56,480","\"I thought you said this was the last level, the last one.\""]

["00:58,160","01:00,160","\"No, just I don't know.\""]
["01:00,160","01:02,880","\"When it comes to levels with like sonic stages,\""]
["01:02,880","01:05,920","\"I feel like the sweet spot is like a typical song link.\""]
["01:05,920","01:09,760","\"Like two minutes and 30 seconds would be how long I want to level to be.\""]
["01:09,760","01:10,800","\"Ideally.\""]
["01:10,800","01:12,720","\"This is a sonic colors level.\""]

["01:13,920","01:15,440","\"It's like when it starts getting like five minutes,\""]
["01:15,440","01:18,160","\"I know I fell off so it's also a me to blame.\""]
["01:18,160","01:22,320","\"But at the same time, it's like this, these meandering on tracks is a little annoying.\""]
["01:22,320","01:24,720","\"I'm sorry, Corey.\""]
["01:24,720","01:25,360","\"That's fine.\""]

["01:59,880","02:01,280","\"Yeah, let's not even try to speak.\""]
["02:01,280","02:02,280","\"I need to take some money.\""]
["02:02,280","02:04,880","\"You wouldn't borrow $600.\""]

["06:07,560","06:08,560","\"the game.\""]
["06:08,560","06:11,840","\"I was just wondering if Dorkly did this instead.\""]
["06:11,840","06:13,640","\"No Dorkly writes about mundane things.\""]
["06:13,640","06:18,440","\"Yeah, they would have him like punching his chest and being some dorkly over mashed.\""]

["06:32,760","06:34,320","\"I hate it.\""]
["06:34,320","06:35,520","\"I genuinely don't like it.\""]
["06:35,520","06:40,680","\"And they meet so many sonic like parodies and cartoons that are just so unbelievably dumb and awful\""]
["06:40,680","06:46,320","\"To be fair what what ground is not been tread with sonic?\""]
["06:46,320","06:52,240","\"Oh my god, that was a god. That was like a dark souls moment fake out. Yeah\""]
["06:52,240","06:56,040","\"Yeah, I didn't want to say anything, but I already knew that except for million hours in this game\""]
["06:56,040","07:02,080","\"You should have at least given it like a fake scream when it happened. Yeah, you should have you should have reacted more\""]
["07:02,800","07:06,240","\"To be honest the context whoa while he's supposed to do that\""]
["07:06,240","07:12,540","\"Yeah, I was that was my that was also like to show you that you can actually die if you go into tornado or classic sonic\""]
["07:12,540","07:19,440","\"This is a good stage. I'm a center block and smashes classic sonic's head. Does he cease to be?\""]
["07:19,440","07:22,000","\"Yeah, I think it's a lot of different\""]
["07:22,000","07:26,040","\"Eddity no there are a few turn past it is\""]
["07:27,840","07:33,840","\"this this was generations but like forces was like as if they were won what I'm\""]
["07:33,840","07:37,020","\"saying is don't they have different timelines no no it's not it's not it\""]
["07:37,020","07:41,220","\"enforces does like pass sonic lose an arm and future sonic gets like a metal\""]
["07:41,220","07:46,120","\"or looper rules no no this is no I was wrong I was wrong it's the opposite they\""]
["07:46,120","07:50,160","\"are I think they are opposite they're different okay I don't need to go there\""]

["07:58,240","07:59,240","\"Yeah, I liked it.\""]
["07:59,240","08:11,680","\"It went zoomed out really far so I could see the stage well for context reasons.\""]
["08:11,680","08:15,240","\"I can't believe they figured out exactly what makes Sonic fun with these games and then\""]
["08:15,240","08:16,520","\"they never did it really again.\""]
["08:16,520","08:17,520","\"I know.\""]
["08:17,520","08:21,320","\"Like, generations was like peak with 3D and stuff.\""]
["08:21,320","08:26,500","\"They squandered everything else, but I still think like the other games are good in their own right look\""]
["08:26,500","08:29,040","\"I like Sonic lost world. I know it's not great\""]
["08:29,040","08:32,140","\"But it has some charm to it and there's some fun to it\""]
