["01:44,680","01:47,760","\"Green Mario. I think that's already Luigi's name, right?\""]
["01:47,760","01:52,120","\"Yeah, he like legally changed it. He got emancipated legally changed his name\""]

["01:59,960","02:03,200","\"Wanna rip his hair want to rip it right off his head?\""]
["02:03,200","02:08,760","\"Do you think if you pulled up on his hair like his brain would be connected to it like a radish or something?\""]

["02:20,320","02:25,920","\"You know what I think was a huge waste of opportunity. What do you think? You know troll dolls?\""]
["02:26,200","02:31,760","\"Yeah, you know when DreamWorks made that trolls movie right they really missed out not using the original designs\""]
["02:31,760","02:37,520","\"And just making it into a horrifying nightmare movie. Yeah, like a weird self-aware like yeah\""]
["02:37,520","02:39,520","\"They should have done that because it's based on the same property\""]
["02:39,520","02:40,960","\"Yeah, I'm still there right yeah\""]
["02:40,960","02:44,960","\"I hate that I mean like the new movie looks nice for kit like his obviously gonna enjoy it\""]

["02:49,140","02:55,920","\"I really can't even believe that the original troll designs got through even in what the 80s 90s were crazy popular\""]
["02:55,920","03:01,940","\"But I would say I can't believe that they're that popular for how fucking ugly they were I think weird things that just stand out\""]

["03:22,400","03:26,400","\"But I think that they were supposed to be cute which might be why they're not around anymore\""]
["03:26,400","03:30,640","\"It is kind of weird where if you find a cabbage patch kid in real life with the same proportions\""]
["03:30,640","03:32,640","\"You would just be like this is a monster\""]
