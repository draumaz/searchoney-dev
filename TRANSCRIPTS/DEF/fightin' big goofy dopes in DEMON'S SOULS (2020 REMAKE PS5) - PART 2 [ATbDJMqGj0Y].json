["12:49,020","12:50,420","\"I am prejudging them,\""]
["12:50,420","12:52,700","\"but I really think that the half moon grass\""]

["12:54,060","13:00,100","\"My name is Lyle. I speak for the trees. I do. I mean, I don't speak for them\""]
["13:00,100","13:05,860","\"But I have a pretty good idea of what they're the lilacs the lilacs\""]
["13:05,860","13:08,180","\"Oh, no\""]
["13:08,180","13:11,700","\"My name is Lyle. I speak for the trees and stuff. I\""]
["13:11,700","13:15,740","\"Would have killed that motherfucker when he started selling air. Oh\""]
["13:15,740","13:23,020","\"Hair like a little Danny DeVito guy. That's from the fucking illumination movie. Yeah\""]
["13:23,020","13:28,780","\"Oh hair's not canon wait who's what's oh hair? He's the guy he's the little bastard who sells air\""]
["13:28,780","13:34,380","\"Wait, what the what the fuck was the book about then just the the one slur and the lorax?\""]
["13:34,380","13:39,220","\"Oh, so there was that third guy was just added in so that dude\""]
["13:39,220","13:45,020","\"Like could be the main character and not the main villain exactly. Oh\""]
["13:45,020","13:49,420","\"Yeah\""]
["13:49,420","13:51,420","\"Come on you fucking\""]
["13:51,420","13:58,100","\"Look at this gooper that thing's so fucking creepy. He's just a silly shield with goop and shit\""]
["13:58,100","14:01,780","\"I've always thought blob monsters are like really gross\""]
["14:01,780","14:04,880","\"Have you seen creep show to the movie?\""]
["14:04,880","14:07,940","\"Creep show - yeah, there's a really good\""]
["14:07,940","14:15,360","\"Short film in that where it's these these kids go to a lake and there's this blob monster on the surface of the lake\""]
["14:15,360","14:21,100","\"That just like glides over and eats them. It's like fucking scary. I don't know there's something about it\""]
["14:21,100","14:26,580","\"It's always weird when something's just like a big amoeba or something, you know what I mean?\""]
["14:26,580","14:32,580","\"Yeah, there's like no there's no humanity do it. Yeah, it's just a horrible force to record with\""]
["14:32,580","14:38,980","\"But that that one holds a shield in the swords, and maybe it's not the same thing. It's still creepy\""]
["14:38,980","14:45,860","\"Oh, you know what I learned the other day, but you know the blobfish. Yep. You know that's not actually what they look like\""]
["14:45,860","14:49,860","\"Yeah, it was like that's when they're exposed to the surface of the pressure sucks them inside out\""]
["14:49,940","14:55,340","\"Yeah, and then everyone are the guys who brought it up kind of made everyone think that's what they look like\""]
["14:55,340","14:59,340","\"Did they know well and good that that's what it was and they were probably not not I don't know\""]
["14:59,340","15:03,260","\"Okay, so it's not like them you remember the montak monster\""]
["15:03,260","15:08,580","\"Montag monster it was like a fucking raccoon or something that like washed ashore\""]
["15:08,580","15:13,700","\"Whoa it it left like a really weird skeleton and people were like what is this creature?\""]
["15:13,700","15:17,980","\"There's just a raccoon I yeah, it was something like that Tomar. I discovered something amazing\""]
["15:17,980","15:23,220","\"Come on in and I'll show you. Have you ever seen such a silly sight?\""]
["15:23,220","15:26,500","\"Oh\""]
["15:26,500","15:32,420","\"Shit, are you at the phalanx? Yeesh, but I have no fire bombs. So I'm kind of got one thought do I?\""]
["15:32,420","15:38,980","\"We need the fire bomb to fight it. This is probably gonna be really hard with this horrible shield. Let's see if I can do it\""]
["15:38,980","15:46,420","\"This music's way too over the top\""]
["15:46,420","15:49,900","\"Yeah, I hate no music\""]
["15:49,900","15:55,180","\"Old music on the new music\""]
["15:55,180","16:04,820","\"That is essentially true\""]
["16:04,820","16:07,340","\"You have to admit to me is\""]
["16:07,340","16:10,300","\"What is this not working?\""]
["16:10,940","16:13,660","\"Ouchers what the fuck why is my pot my\""]
["16:13,660","16:21,500","\"Why is that not working? I don't understand picking his butt maybe it'll be work some blades really you got a shot there you go\""]
["16:21,500","16:30,980","\"I was not expecting that sound to come out of it. What the fuck dude really really fucked ourselves by picking this\""]
["16:30,980","16:33,500","\"I didn't know I didn't know either. It's not your fault\""]
["16:33,500","16:38,020","\"This is just gonna take so long without the resin working. I don't understand why it's not working\""]
["16:38,660","16:44,420","\"Is it only blades you do have that scimitar? I don't have the right stats to use it. What about the male breaker?\""]
["16:44,420","16:50,500","\"That's like really weak if it works with the pine resin or whatever though. She's\""]
["16:50,500","16:54,740","\"Okay, we'll try that\""]
["16:54,740","17:00,540","\"Yeah, see if it does work. Okay. Yeah, it has to be a blade I guess\""]
["17:00,540","17:06,500","\"So it's totally the fucking club just doesn't work with it in dark souls. It's not the case. This one confused. It's weird\""]
["17:06,500","17:13,500","\"This is way faster than that.\""]
["17:13,500","17:15,140","\"This is going to take a while.\""]
["17:15,140","17:16,580","\"I believe in you.\""]
["17:16,580","17:20,780","\"Okay, unless you keep doing that.\""]
["17:20,780","17:21,780","\"Christ on a bike.\""]
["17:21,780","17:25,580","\"I shouldn't have wasted all my fire bombs on the enemies.\""]
["17:25,580","17:29,700","\"It was kind of funny though, especially those dudes with the hats.\""]
["17:29,700","17:33,660","\"I think that just to see the look on their faces it was kind of worth it.\""]
["17:33,660","17:35,260","\"Just to see that.\""]
["17:35,260","17:37,860","\"Do these little ones actually spawn infinitely or do they?\""]
["17:37,860","17:38,860","\"I don't think so, no.\""]
["17:38,860","17:39,360","\"Okay.\""]
["17:39,360","17:42,060","\"I think after a while they'll stop.\""]
["17:42,060","17:43,660","\"So the thing will be defenseless.\""]
["17:43,660","17:44,660","\"Yeah.\""]
["17:44,660","17:45,760","\"I'm not even defen- I'll just use-\""]

["18:04,860","18:06,860","\"Oh god, this is a bad spot.\""]
["18:06,860","18:07,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["18:07,860","18:11,860","\"Wait, is that a shield?\""]
["18:11,860","18:13,860","\"Oh, it might be actually.\""]
["18:13,860","18:16,860","\"That on the ground there?\""]
["18:16,860","18:18,860","\"That's a shield.\""]
["18:18,860","18:19,860","\"Oh, Shard.\""]
["18:19,860","18:22,860","\"I've read that as shield too.\""]
["18:22,860","18:24,860","\"That was just wishful thinking.\""]
["18:24,860","18:26,860","\"Sorry, bros, not this time.\""]
["18:26,860","18:28,860","\"It seems like you can kind of do that from the front.\""]
["18:28,860","18:31,860","\"Yeah, sometimes.\""]
["18:31,860","18:32,860","\"There you go.\""]
["18:32,860","18:37,260","\"Yeah, don't ever stand in one place for longer than a few seconds.\""]
["18:37,260","18:39,760","\"Is that targeting pattern they have?\""]
["18:39,760","18:43,260","\"I think I had the male breaker throw it up and absolutely fucked.\""]
["18:43,260","18:46,760","\"See, Talmar?\""]
["18:46,760","18:50,260","\"It wasn't a waste of time to pick it up after all.\""]
["18:50,260","18:51,260","\"Yeah, two more.\""]
["18:51,260","18:53,760","\"When did I apply than it was?\""]
["18:53,760","18:54,260","\"I don't know.\""]
["18:54,260","18:56,660","\"He picked it up and you rolled your eyes.\""]

["18:58,160","18:59,660","\"You rolled your eyes.\""]
["18:59,660","19:01,160","\"Maybe I get the pine resin on there.\""]
["19:01,160","19:02,660","\"You'd be doing real good damage.\""]
