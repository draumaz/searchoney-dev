["17:20,560","17:27,940","\"Well, you'm sorry if you're scared, but that's the whole point the whole point of the game is to get\""]
["17:29,640","17:36,040","\"All right, let's this is toward the lake the path fighting took him around the stupid save point. So instead of making a beeline\""]
["17:36,040","17:39,720","\"You made up see swerved real quick\""]
["17:39,720","17:46,820","\"Read a question work shit. Yo, um, what is what does beeline mean? Why does it say beeline?\""]
["17:46,820","17:51,140","\"I don't know. It's just a term people use it. It's a straight line\""]
["17:51,140","17:53,920","\"Yeah, I don't know the origin of beeline\""]
["17:54,320","17:59,740","\"This is from chora.com. It's where you see a good deal somewhere that you can't pass up\""]
["17:59,740","18:05,560","\"So you make a beeline straight for it spelled beat by the way be like a bee. Yeah, that's where I always start\""]
["18:05,560","18:10,800","\"But when you know that's not a good it that's not an explanation\""]
["18:10,800","18:15,960","\"So it says when you know there's goods to be had at a very reduced price\""]
["18:15,960","18:20,720","\"You want to make a beeline straight for it too. So basically wherever you can get a super\""]
["18:21,440","18:27,380","\"Dooper good deal and save money in the long run. Let's really make a beeline this person is explaining where the phrase comes from\""]
["18:27,380","18:32,980","\"I don't think this person is even right. I feel like they're they're just some person who's describing like the\""]
["18:32,980","18:35,560","\"context that they've heard beeline use\""]
["18:35,560","18:42,140","\"Okay, I hate that yeah, I hate that so much. Did he die the phrase? Oh, sorry\""]
["18:42,140","18:46,600","\"Yeah, I think I just read the answer from skits of Frank person or something. Yeah, okay\""]
["18:46,600","18:51,820","\"That was literally the same explanation three times in a row. That was a schizophrenic witch on the core of calm\""]
["18:51,820","18:53,820","\"So this is somebody says\""]
["18:53,820","19:01,020","\"The phrase derives from the behavior of bees when a forager bee finds a source of nectar it returns to the hive and communicates\""]
["19:01,020","19:04,740","\"It's location to the other bees using a display called the waggle\""]
["19:04,740","19:10,180","\"Dance I've heard that the other bees are then able to fly directly to the source of nectar\""]
["19:10,180","19:14,660","\"That is make a bee line for it. Thank you. That is that's what I wanted to hear\""]
["19:15,700","19:18,520","\"Whenever I read was very scary. That was not written by somebody who's well\""]
["19:18,520","19:22,500","\"And by the way, that was just written by like an eight-year-old\""]
["19:22,500","19:26,180","\"There's a here's the problem. I actually I I'm not talking to our I cut out some of the things\""]
["19:26,180","19:28,180","\"They went on more and repeated the same thing again\""]
["19:28,180","19:33,540","\"Really it different. Yeah so much different phrasing so they basically rephrased the same point about six times\""]
["19:33,540","19:41,580","\"It sounds like somebody once heard beeline used in context of somebody like rushing to the store to get a deal and just\""]
["19:41,580","19:44,140","\"Assume from that one-off experience\""]
["19:45,140","19:51,200","\"I can't believe they never like fact check themselves the way for tried to explain it to me. Yeah trust me trust me\""]
["19:51,200","19:53,200","\"Yeah trust me\""]
