["00:14,700","00:15,200","\"\"\"Did he really?\"\"\""]
["00:15,200","00:18,200","\"\"\"Yeah, he killed him in the previous level, remember? He was Bart-man.\"\"\""]
["00:18,200","00:18,800","\"\"\"Uh-oh.\"\"\""]

["00:22,600","00:23,100","\"\"\"That's Homer.\"\"\""]
["00:23,100","00:27,480","\"In the beginning yeah, that's Homer that's Homer when he's trying not to think about Mindy. Oh, yeah\""]
["00:27,480","00:32,540","\"And then she turns in he turns into Mindy's so fucking hot\""]
["00:32,540","00:40,400","\"Would you eat a donut with her? Yeah, she's too fake for me. Would you gag and go on a donut with her in the sense that like\""]
["00:40,400","00:46,100","\"She's so like artificially written to be perfect for Homer. I mean, it's the idea of the episode\""]
["00:46,100","00:51,060","\"I feel like you could make it more believe that it's all supposed to be very coincidental that it lined up the way it did\""]
["00:51,180","00:53,180","\"That this is the perfect match\""]
["00:53,180","00:57,260","\"And that he stays loyal. I think Larlene works better. Oh, yeah\""]
["00:57,260","01:00,940","\"Larlene has like an actual character. They punished the fuck out of her\""]
["01:00,940","01:05,480","\"See her like add points in the series later\""]
["01:05,480","01:13,040","\"I love the voice clip of Homer when he says no we have to have\""]
["01:13,040","01:16,940","\"He sounds very sad\""]
["01:18,380","01:20,380","\"His voice is cracking\""]
["01:20,380","01:35,020","\"They cut that scene out\""]
["01:35,020","01:40,380","\"What like an extended three minutes\""]
["01:40,380","01:42,380","\"I'm not kidding\""]
["01:42,380","01:44,060","\"She got summoned by the\""]
["01:54,940","01:57,840","\"She got summoned by the floor cleaner\""]
["01:57,840","02:05,340","\"Have you ever enjoyed double jumps and video games yeah like fighting games I like uh\""]
["02:05,340","02:10,440","\"Because in fighting games it makes sense. It's you're keeping your direction while you do the double jump\""]
["02:10,440","02:17,060","\"It can be handy jumping backwards. Yeah, I've seen people say like there's no point of double jumps\""]
["02:17,060","02:21,840","\"Just make the one jump higher. Yeah, but I always thought like hey that's more complexity\""]
["02:21,840","02:27,760","\"It's that you still have to make the judgment as to when to do the second one to do it sometimes you can like steer yourself\""]
["02:27,760","02:28,800","\"Depending on your\""]
["02:28,800","02:35,760","\"I really like specifically whenever there's a hover mechanic I like Yoshi's Island's hover mechanic is my favorite because\""]
["02:35,760","02:41,760","\"There's like a varying height to it. Yeah, you can do it if you seriously can do it in one frame\""]
["02:41,760","02:43,760","\"You can increase your height with it. I think\""]
["02:43,760","02:49,040","\"The fact that it goes up at the end like he he goes up and down in the air\""]
["02:49,040","02:54,080","\"I think double jumps are perfect for characters jumps that are like super quick like really fast\""]
["02:54,080","02:58,800","\"I mean the thing is - it can be a thing to fill in for like a mistake if you didn't\""]
["02:58,800","03:04,840","\"It's just kind of handy to have as a movement option. I don't mind it\""]
["03:04,840","03:10,640","\"The thing is I don't know game discussions gun weird over the years - people have like absolute rules\""]
["03:10,640","03:14,160","\"Yeah, that's the always the idea of like is this thing outdated and you're like well\""]
["03:14,160","03:16,160","\"I mean that depends\""]
["03:16,760","03:20,760","\"Almost everything's a variable. It's hard to set concrete moves.\""]
["03:20,760","03:24,760","\"I think that's just kind of a problem with internet culture in general. It's very absolutous.\""]
["03:24,760","03:25,760","\"True.\""]
["03:25,760","03:31,760","\"It's the idea of like, okay, either you, we have to make a rule, you guys. Everybody's gotta agree on this one thing.\""]
["03:31,760","03:33,760","\"This is the stupidest video game.\""]
["03:33,760","03:35,760","\"Imagine growing up with a...\""]
["03:35,760","03:37,760","\"And only having this one game.\""]
["03:37,760","03:39,760","\"Well, I had baby as kids after, don't worry.\""]
["03:39,760","03:41,760","\"Oh, did you also do babies kids?\""]
["03:41,760","03:42,760","\"Babies kids?\""]
["03:42,760","03:44,000","\"- Baby's kids?\""]

["03:53,120","03:53,940","\"- Did you?\""]
["03:53,940","03:56,160","\"- I think it was like an HBO recording of it or something,\""]
["03:56,160","03:59,520","\"but I watched it constantly and I had a choice\""]
["03:59,520","04:01,400","\"on my birthday of a game that I could buy\""]
["04:01,400","04:03,600","\"and Mega Man X was always at Blockbuster.\""]

["04:06,920","04:08,280","\"That game's not at Blockbuster.\""]

["04:22,660","04:24,400","\"I bet you've shrieked in pleasure.\""]
["04:24,400","04:27,280","\"(laughing)\""]
["04:27,280","04:30,040","\"- I had to think 'cause it's like, yeah, I guess he does.\""]
["04:30,040","04:31,400","\"You mean Robin Harris, right?\""]
["04:31,400","04:33,000","\"That he picks his nose while waiting?\""]
["04:33,000","04:34,240","\"- Yeah, he just picks it and looks at it\""]
["04:34,240","04:35,080","\"and flicks it away.\""]
["04:35,080","04:36,080","\"It's like cool. - He does.\""]
["04:36,080","04:37,520","\"- I do like him running up to the car.\""]
["04:37,520","04:39,240","\"It's like a two-frame animation.\""]
["04:39,240","04:40,880","\"- The drone with his legs really far apart.\""]
["04:40,880","04:43,520","\"Also running up to the window and everybody screaming is alright\""]
["04:43,520","04:50,840","\"It doesn't look anything like him. It doesn't even look like Robert here is people running at the camera and people screaming is always funny\""]
["04:50,840","04:52,840","\"It's true like fat Albert\""]
["04:52,840","04:58,280","\"Golly she's crying. I'm gonna really make her cry\""]
["05:08,240","05:10,880","\"Also, why the fuck is she watching fat Albert anyways?\""]
["05:10,880","05:13,040","\"She was crying and she just wanted someone to make a feel better.\""]
["05:13,040","05:17,200","\"Does she invite a friend over at the end like, \"\"Come on, you have to watch the show. It's really fun. It's called fat Albert.\"\"\""]
["05:17,200","05:19,200","\"They learn lessons every episode.\""]
["05:19,200","05:22,300","\"Please, dear God, beat this Indiana Gones level.\""]
["05:22,300","05:27,360","\"I think I might have gone past the part that I was trapping me.\""]
["05:27,360","05:30,340","\"Guys, I'm sorry. I'm not the best at Bart's Nightmare. It is true.\""]
["05:30,340","05:31,360","\"It's okay, dude.\""]

["05:33,360","05:34,040","\"You got a what?\""]
["05:34,040","05:37,680","\"I got a really good parody for you. You should make a cartoon called Indiana Bone.\""]
["05:37,680","05:43,580","\"I need like a skeleton because it's not it's not Jones, but it sounds like yeah, it sounds similar\""]
["05:43,580","05:46,920","\"Honestly good idea. I don't know how I never thought of it\""]
["05:46,920","05:54,280","\"Alternatively rather than a skeleton it could be like an adult animation where it's a guy. He's like hey\""]
["05:54,280","05:58,120","\"Oh, he's got a bone and I I bone girls a lot\""]
["05:58,120","06:03,480","\"Love that catchphrase\""]
["06:04,400","06:09,240","\"Yeah, he has a Jones's catchphrase. Yeah, do you think you catch on this character? You think this could work?\""]
["06:09,240","06:12,980","\"You can get a web series going mondo media\""]
["06:12,980","06:20,140","\"There's this catchphrase that is the weirdest thing I ever heard I love\""]

["07:33,240","07:36,780","\"Bunch of big old children\""]
["07:41,060","07:43,140","\"- If we watch that with you on the Fed Albert box,\""]
["07:43,140","07:47,100","\"that they have like a commentary about like the making of,\""]
["07:47,100","07:50,180","\"and they interview Bill Cosby about each kid.\""]
["07:50,180","07:52,100","\"And they get to Bucky, and he just goes,\""]
["07:52,100","07:55,780","\"Bucky was a kid who had big days.\""]
["07:55,780","07:56,620","\"(laughing)\""]
["07:56,620","07:58,460","\"And that's literally the end of it.\""]
["07:58,460","08:00,500","\"He talks about like all the others for a minute,\""]
["08:00,500","08:02,460","\"and he has nothing to say about that character.\""]

["08:10,340","08:13,340","\"I wonder did he ever talk to you to those friends again?\""]
["08:13,340","08:15,640","\"Are they really?\""]
["08:15,640","08:18,840","\"I don't think they want to keep in contact with them anymore anyways.\""]
["08:18,840","08:21,340","\"The people in the movie that are supposed to be as friends.\""]
["08:21,340","08:25,340","\"Yes, I think those are as friends in the movie.\""]
["08:25,340","08:25,840","\"Okay.\""]
["08:25,840","08:29,840","\"That would be weird to just cast random old people and go, \"\"You're my friend now.\"\"\""]
["08:29,840","08:33,340","\"All of the Bart's nightmares are experts and go, \"\"Fuck themselves.\"\"\""]
["08:33,340","08:35,340","\"You just killed them by saying that.\""]

["08:42,240","08:49,740","\"It's okay Chris you get to think about the Simpsons more. I don't want to ever play that. Okay, bye Skinner. I didn't mean to do that\""]
["08:49,740","08:57,280","\"You mean Tan-Arriman Tanzerian. That's true. That is his real name and his real characterization\""]
["08:57,280","09:04,440","\"The writer of that episode was just like I don't regret that episode. It was a good episode. Fuck off\""]
["09:05,240","09:09,680","\"It's not like it's like that's what's weird. It's the concept. It's not the episode. Yeah\""]
["09:09,680","09:17,800","\"It's that it is a shitty idea. It's a really dumb idea and as much as I know like Matt Graining is really bothered by that one\""]
["09:17,800","09:21,880","\"Oh, is he really I think the one he's bothered by the most was the critic crossover wasn't it?\""]
["09:21,880","09:24,640","\"He didn't he doesn't even want to be on the commentary for that one\""]
["09:24,640","09:28,000","\"But it's like he did a family guy crossover where they put gas pumps into their butts\""]
["09:28,000","09:32,760","\"I don't think I've heard over the critic that that all of the writers left for that show. I think\""]
["09:33,400","09:36,900","\"I remember his thing with it. It's what I remember\""]
["09:36,900","09:38,800","\"I don't exactly remember what it is\""]
["09:38,800","09:44,280","\"But he seemed to just be bothered by the idea of doing a crossover to promote another show like that that it feels like scummy\""]
["09:44,280","09:47,160","\"But then they did it later on\""]
["09:47,160","09:53,220","\"And they did it with the X files not wasn't even like that much that's different\""]
["09:53,220","09:57,160","\"The chimp channel also did their own X files parody knows hilarious\""]
["09:58,920","10:01,520","\"I'll talk to the folks at home about the chimp channel.\""]
["10:01,520","10:03,520","\"Well, why don't you? You know about it too.\""]
["10:03,520","10:06,720","\"You seemed more invested.\""]
["10:06,720","10:08,520","\"I love those.\""]
["10:08,520","10:09,720","\"We were.\""]
["10:09,720","10:14,320","\"I have a friend who sends me VHS tapes that he's like sick of holding on to.\""]
["10:14,320","10:21,520","\"And so one of them that we recently watched was a it was a recording of what channel was it like?\""]
["10:21,520","10:22,520","\"Show time.\""]
["10:22,520","10:23,320","\"Show time.\""]
["10:23,320","10:27,520","\"Something like that because the commercials were also included in the tape.\""]
["10:27,920","10:35,260","\"We saw over and over again. It was the same line for this show called chimp channel and it was just really lame\""]
["10:35,260","10:44,980","\"Comedy when I just ran it to press I said it's just out my balls, but actually realize monkeys dressed up as people and doing yes\""]
["10:44,980","10:49,220","\"Champs dubbed over being comical and hilarious\""]
["10:49,220","10:51,940","\"But they're not very funny are they?\""]
["10:51,940","10:57,220","\"It's someone who rubbed peanut butter on their gums so that they're constantly opening and closing their mouth\""]
["10:57,220","11:02,580","\"Yeah, and as we all know they have no self-control so they swallow the stuff and choke on it\""]
["11:02,580","11:05,820","\"So there were probably a lot of bad chimps that had to make that show. Oh, no\""]
["11:05,820","11:07,820","\"Did we we were saying this?\""]
["11:07,820","11:10,620","\"Yeah, the joke about that they shoot they shoot a chimp and bring it in to a\""]
["11:10,620","11:14,020","\"Forever take they fuck up the chimp\""]
["11:14,020","11:21,900","\"Bring it in the way, and it's so funny like they did an X files parody where it's just bolder scullator like\""]
["11:22,380","11:27,560","\"Buller let's go. Let's go do the x-fuzzling. Oh make sure that we have we shoot it in the dark\""]
["11:27,560","11:30,520","\"So it's more dramatic. It's like that's the joke hilarious\""]
["11:30,520","11:35,600","\"Look at all these Simpsons references\""]
["11:35,600","11:40,780","\"Gemma dia Gemma dia Gemma dia Gemma this is all he fucking thinks about\""]
["11:40,780","11:49,860","\"It wasn't even that big of a deal\""]

["11:57,580","11:59,680","\"Was that fucking statue?\""]
["11:59,680","12:01,600","\"And they found out he was a pirate, remember?\""]
["12:01,600","12:02,920","\"It's true, that's a good point.\""]
["12:02,920","12:04,960","\"A silver-tongued pirate, no less.\""]
["12:04,960","12:06,380","\"I remember that episode.\""]
["12:06,380","12:08,640","\"It really pissed me off, actually.\""]
