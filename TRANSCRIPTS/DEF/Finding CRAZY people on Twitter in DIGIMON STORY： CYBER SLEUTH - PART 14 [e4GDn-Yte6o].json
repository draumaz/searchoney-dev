["02:51,000","02:55,720","\"Maybe it was a ride intended for kids, but I don't think so. I usually see the elderly riding it\""]
["02:55,720","02:58,200","\"I have horrible memories of knots. Why's that?\""]
["02:58,200","03:02,400","\"Because we got stuck on a ride for two hours, you know the one that hangs that like you're hanging in it\""]

["03:28,480","03:31,480","\"And they were going around so that we would be dead last\""]
["03:31,480","03:37,320","\"Are you fucking kidding me get me out of here like that and they're like okay, sorry\""]
["03:37,320","03:41,320","\"They all slowly turn their heads at you smile and walk away\""]

["03:46,320","03:49,480","\"And then when I got off a guy was like, oh you got to get up first, huh?\""]
["03:49,480","03:57,120","\"Remember this story you told this story fucking dickhead. I would have just waited like somebody has to be last\""]
["03:57,120","04:03,240","\"Was next to the screamer so just put up with it fuck off. I put up with it for two hours\""]
["04:03,240","04:06,600","\"It's not okay now in a bit, but put up with it for long enough\""]
["04:06,600","04:11,280","\"I'm telling you know if you were just screaming back. They would have taken you off early\""]
["04:11,280","04:13,480","\"You know that they probably would have also the ones in the Sun\""]
["04:13,480","04:17,520","\"I can't believe they were unlocking the people in the shape you should have kept screaming. I have a condition\""]
["04:17,520","04:19,520","\"Oh, hey, look at that.\""]
["04:19,520","04:22,880","\"Say it in that voice. Yeah, oh\""]
["04:22,880","04:31,100","\"Anyway, no offense to the autistic girl. I'm sorry that that happened to you. It does sound like a really miserable time\""]
["04:31,100","04:37,340","\"I get wait and then I was really hard not to refund us because we went we went from one ride that was closed\""]
["04:37,340","04:42,320","\"It's shut down the second we got to it. Yeah, then we got to another one shut down the second\""]

["04:50,280","04:52,280","\"Right fine, and they're like okay\""]
["04:52,280","04:57,720","\"And then you said fine, maybe I'll make my own theme park. I said you get more people\""]
["04:57,720","05:02,840","\"I have over fucking a million subscribers on YouTube, but I'm making a video on you\""]
["05:02,840","05:09,720","\"I mean some people say that yeah, I and they do I think it's specifically the girl in the uber or whatever\""]
["05:09,720","05:15,640","\"You didn't think about the pillaging of the, like, continent of Hawaii.\""]
["05:15,640","05:18,840","\"So you won't get rid of the dolla then.\""]
["05:18,840","05:21,880","\"Because that was like really cute because you find a good one.\""]

["05:42,820","05:45,520","\"People sure\""]
["05:45,520","05:51,060","\"People haven't been shy to show how hateful they really are. I love it when those people get so cocky\""]
["05:51,060","05:53,060","\"They're like oh, you know what?\""]
["05:53,060","05:56,720","\"This is good to be delightful. I've got to look so great online. Well, I make this fool\""]
["05:56,720","06:02,800","\"I wish it was phrase more that way. Yeah, it'd be more entertaining. Yeah, it's fooled\""]
["06:03,640","06:08,280","\"That's how she was this she's like I am so in the right here. Nothing could possibly go wrong\""]
["06:08,280","06:13,240","\"And he's going to get fired and I'm gonna smoke. I was imagining you're voicing him for a second on screen\""]
["06:13,240","06:15,960","\"Did you like my voice for the fraud? Yeah?\""]
["06:15,960","06:23,280","\"But you know fuck that lady bitch, how would you voice the turd Chris?\""]
["06:23,280","06:30,400","\"Probably he can't talk and the great mind would be like\""]

["06:54,360","06:57,640","\"Well, he doesn't want to do it anyway. No\""]
["06:58,200","07:00,920","\"Something is trashy speed-dating.\""]

["07:30,520","07:34,240","\"I know it was half the bath hole.\""]
["07:34,240","07:36,160","\"How was your trip to the bathroom, Chris?\""]
["07:36,160","07:36,880","\"It was good.\""]
["07:36,880","07:39,120","\"I tried to eat, but don't forget to come out.\""]
["07:39,120","07:41,000","\"Oh, I'm sorry.\""]
["07:41,000","07:42,800","\"It's OK.\""]
["07:42,800","07:45,600","\"Have you ever been injured in the bathroom before?\""]
["07:45,600","07:46,600","\"Oh.\""]
["07:46,600","07:47,600","\"Mm.\""]
["07:47,600","07:48,260","\"No.\""]
["07:48,260","07:50,960","\"Like did your butt ever fall out?\""]
["07:50,960","07:52,920","\"Like a prolapse?\""]
["07:52,920","07:53,760","\"Oh, no.\""]
["07:53,760","07:55,440","\"I've never prolapsed yet.\""]
["07:55,440","07:56,840","\"That sounds scary, doesn't it?\""]
["07:56,840","07:58,840","\"Still trying to happen.\""]
["07:58,840","08:04,480","\"Why do he why don't you like this turd Chris? I don't get it\""]
["08:04,480","08:07,600","\"Think a boo. He sees you\""]
["08:07,600","08:10,240","\"Peekaboo\""]
["08:10,240","08:15,000","\"I'm gonna get that for my kid. I'll grow up real fucked up. What a plush of that shit\""]
["08:15,000","08:22,040","\"Get them a giant pillow of it. Would you be upset if that was you your child's favorite? Did you mom? Kinda? Yeah?\""]
["08:22,040","08:25,000","\"Would you take it away from them?\""]
["08:25,560","08:34,520","\"Yes, there's something inherently interesting about shit to young people to go why why does everyone get rid of this and you have to cut them off of it early?\""]
["08:34,520","08:36,200","\"Yeah, okay\""]
["08:36,200","08:41,120","\"Well about Greymon. Do you see him as being a problem for small children to idolize?\""]
["08:41,120","08:46,160","\"No, he's cool, but he burns them. Of course they'll grow up wanting to have a skull on their head all the time\""]
["08:46,160","08:52,000","\"That's true. Good. Look finding one. It's very problematic Chris. It could be yours my skull. Yeah\""]
["08:52,880","08:57,120","\"Your child could be scheming. I think that's a great experiment idea\""]
["08:57,120","09:01,580","\"Put a skull on a baby's head and watch them grow into it and see what happens\""]
["09:01,580","09:06,580","\"I think a little cubon. Yeah, I do want to talk more about how you felt about\""]
["09:06,580","09:13,960","\"Pokemon the movie 2000. I'm so boring. It was I'm sorry. You seemed like you were looking forward to it\""]
["09:13,960","09:18,620","\"I remember it being better than that. It was pretty boring. I never was that big\""]
["09:18,620","09:22,900","\"I mean the thing is I'm not really big on any of the Pokemon movies even as a kid as a kid\""]
["09:22,900","09:25,400","\"I liked the first one because it was you know\""]
["09:25,400","09:28,660","\"It was more of an event that it was the first Pokemon movie\""]
["09:28,660","09:33,940","\"I remember the sequel because 2000 feels so grand scale like yes, it's very weird\""]
["09:33,940","09:36,980","\"I like the premise more of the first movie\""]
["09:36,980","09:42,580","\"But the second one is really strange that it's like the world is fucking out ending everybody's gonna die\""]
["09:42,580","09:47,580","\"Except on there on one set piece for the entire thing where it's just a plain\""]
["09:47,820","09:54,660","\"Yeah, no escape. It's really boring. Nothing really happens. I at least liked the third one for being born for being boring\""]
["09:54,660","10:04,320","\"Weird in tone, but that was kind of all I had going for it. That's the one with the dog become her dad\""]
["10:04,320","10:07,340","\"Yes, the dog become a man and makes her age\""]
["10:07,340","10:10,180","\"She grows up\""]
["10:10,180","10:16,420","\"I think that was the last one I ever saw and I remembered it was a thing of like because it was the last one in theaters\""]
["10:16,420","10:21,480","\"It was the moment of like yeah, I don't I'm done with it. Yeah, I think I need to see these anymore\""]
["10:21,480","10:29,720","\"But the thing was I was never super into like Pokemon's anime anyhow. I probably would have stuck with it\""]
["10:29,720","10:32,300","\"But that because four was not in\""]
["10:32,300","10:40,400","\"Theaters forever and everyone to see it and what's the fifth? I feel like I saw it on TV at some point Pokemon 5 ever\""]
["10:40,400","10:46,360","\"What's the fifth one? I don't know I don't remember that's that is the point at which I stopped caring Pokemon\""]
["10:46,360","10:50,000","\"and it's entirely animated from people who run Fiverr.\""]
["10:50,000","10:50,840","\"- They should do that.\""]
["10:50,840","10:52,680","\"- That's a great idea.\""]
["10:52,680","10:55,680","\"You guys shattered my reality when we were watching that film.\""]
["10:55,680","10:56,520","\"- Why's that?\""]
["10:56,520","10:58,080","\"- 'Cause it's all about La Gia, right?\""]
["10:58,080","10:58,920","\"- Yeah.\""]
["10:58,920","10:59,760","\"- And then I turned and I was like,\""]
["10:59,760","11:01,680","\"so whatever happened to Ho-Oh, and they were like,\""]
["11:01,680","11:02,520","\"what?\""]
["11:02,520","11:04,200","\"I'm like, whatever happened with them, they're like,\""]
["11:04,200","11:05,040","\"what do you mean?\""]
["11:05,040","11:07,040","\"And like, showed them in the first episode\""]
["11:07,040","11:07,880","\"and they were like--\""]
["11:07,880","11:08,720","\"- And never?\""]
["11:08,720","11:09,560","\"- And then go anywhere.\""]
["11:09,560","11:10,400","\"- Yeah.\""]
["11:10,400","11:11,720","\"- What?\""]
["11:11,720","11:12,560","\"- Pokemon.\""]
["11:12,560","11:13,680","\"- Like I literally thought about that\""]
["11:13,680","11:15,760","\"for fucking like 25 years.\""]
["11:15,760","11:20,220","\"Pokemon is really good at dropping plot threads. Okay, not 25, but a long ass long time\""]
["11:20,220","11:25,660","\"I said really I had thought about it at least once a year since I saw that it in the first episode\""]
["11:25,660","11:30,360","\"I was like what what is with that Pokemon? Why did it show him like that?\""]
["11:30,360","11:35,800","\"That pissed me off. I'm very sorry Chris. I'm sorry and then Julian told me another thing\""]
["11:35,800","11:41,820","\"I never saw G. S ball. What was the other yeah the G. S ball that never resolved. What the fuck were they doing? I\""]
["11:42,360","11:48,160","\"Don't know the GS ball is a thing. I can't tell you like it was gonna be an event in the game at least that\""]
["11:48,160","11:53,060","\"That was a thing they actually you put it in the shrine to get celery. Oh there they are\""]
["11:53,060","11:56,360","\"Oh, no, it's finally found them. This is gonna rock. I\""]
["11:56,360","11:59,500","\"Know how much you love this storyline Chris\""]
["11:59,500","12:04,040","\"It's my little pals\""]
["12:04,040","12:07,240","\"They must be in danger\""]
["12:07,240","12:09,680","\"Let's put them in more danger\""]
["12:11,640","12:13,640","\"No, I can't\""]

["20:00,860","20:05,140","\"That might have been part of the thought process, but you can still make it look cool. You can texture it\""]
