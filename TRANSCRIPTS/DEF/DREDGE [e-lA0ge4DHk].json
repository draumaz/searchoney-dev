["00:00,000","00:04,400","\"This game only 682 megabytes by the way, that's my kind of game.\""]
["00:04,400","00:06,160","\"Oh really? Is it that small?\""]
["00:06,160","00:07,520","\"Dude, that's what it just said anyway.\""]
["00:07,520","00:09,200","\"Ah, it calls them \"\"Smegabytes\"\"!\""]
["00:09,200","00:13,040","\"Explain to the audience why you call them that.\""]
["00:13,040","00:16,640","\"That sounds like the world's most like disgusting fast food item.\""]
["00:16,640","00:17,840","\"Smekibites.\""]
["00:17,840","00:24,560","\"I'm playing this for the first time by the way.\""]
["00:24,560","00:25,840","\"Ooh, this is great.\""]
["00:25,840","00:28,880","\"I've played about like three, four hours of this game.\""]
["00:28,880","00:32,280","\"So I'm a pretty decent chunk into it and I love it.\""]
["00:32,280","00:33,680","\"It's my little tugger.\""]
["00:33,680","00:34,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:34,180","00:36,180","\"You can't call it that man.\""]
["00:36,180","00:36,980","\"Why can't wait?\""]
["00:36,980","00:37,580","\"I can't.\""]
["00:37,580","00:38,980","\"I mean, I guess.\""]
["00:38,980","00:39,380","\"Tugger.\""]
["00:39,380","00:41,780","\"I wouldn't be saying little if I were you.\""]
["00:41,780","00:44,580","\"And I love how it looks.\""]
["00:44,580","00:46,480","\"Yeah, it's got a really nice style.\""]
["00:46,480","00:48,280","\"This is how the iron giant starts.\""]
["00:48,280","00:48,780","\"Remember?\""]
["00:48,780","00:53,080","\"The two are not too different except in every way, shape, or form.\""]
["00:53,080","00:53,680","\"Mmm.\""]
["00:53,680","00:54,680","\"Mmm.\""]
["00:54,680","00:55,480","\"Mmm.\""]
["00:55,480","00:57,980","\"Already a lighthouse I see.\""]
["00:57,980","01:01,680","\"Alright, a humble village.\""]
["01:01,680","01:04,800","\"The morning light fills your eyes and you try to sit upright.\""]
["01:04,800","01:08,400","\"You're lying on the cold, wet dock where you collapsed the night before.\""]
["01:08,400","01:09,400","\"Ew.\""]
["01:09,400","01:13,300","\"A short man is shutting orders at a handful of workers disembracking from a boat nearby.\""]
["01:13,300","01:15,300","\"The man notices you.\""]
["01:15,300","01:18,060","\"\"\"Paw, welcome to Great Marrow.\"\"\""]
["01:18,060","01:20,580","\"I must say, quite the dramatic first impression.\""]
["01:20,580","01:24,460","\"I see you've already introduced yourself to the jagged rocks along the bay.\""]
["01:24,460","01:25,460","\"\"\"Oh-ho-ho!\"\"\""]
["01:25,460","01:26,460","\"Did you not see the lighthouse?\""]
["01:26,460","01:27,460","\"It was shining right at you.\""]
["01:27,460","01:31,940","\"Idiot. Oh well, I'm glad to see our new fisherman up right and breathing.\""]
["01:31,940","01:37,800","\"Your boat was hopelessly damaged, but I've had a few of the locals move your things to one of our old vessels.\""]
["01:37,800","01:39,940","\"We'll catch up later to discuss more details.\""]
["01:39,940","01:47,340","\"I'll let you get out there to catch some fishies. If you can catch, if you can fill your cargo while you get your bearings in the light.\""]
["01:47,340","01:54,240","\"Finally, I don't suppose I need to say this, but get back beast far sundown before the fog rolls in.\""]
["01:54,240","01:57,100","\"Keep a close eye on the time. It can really creep up on you.\""]
["01:57,100","02:00,880","\"Okay, thank you. All right, I'm gonna undock\""]
["02:00,880","02:09,040","\"Oh look at you look at you go look at you all undocked and tucking\""]
["02:09,040","02:16,620","\"Wait, did I do the wrong? Oh yeah start fishing so you press X when it's over that little\""]
["02:20,500","02:25,980","\"Good sports. Oh, so you got your you got your resident evil like inventory\""]
["02:25,980","02:30,580","\"Organizer thing there. Yeah, I love that you got you got this\""]
["02:30,580","02:37,460","\"It's it's a very like satisfying gameplay loop at the center of this. Oh, it's it's very like, you know\""]
["02:37,460","02:44,340","\"Upgrade your stuff to catch more fish and then you get better stuff and then you know, it's all that kind of good shit\""]
["02:44,340","02:49,580","\"It's very pretty isn't it? It's got a really nice style. It's got those wind waker wind streams\""]
["02:49,580","02:56,140","\"Look at that cod so you can rotate it with all an RB touch with fish. Yeah, okay good\""]
["02:56,140","03:01,060","\"Should I try to go out to where they come from there's like a bunch of villages?\""]
["03:01,060","03:09,340","\"Yeah, so time moves when you uh when you move so if you stay when they move if you stay still it doesn't move at all\""]
["03:09,340","03:16,460","\"So you can fuck with your inventory and stuff like that with zero consequence. There's a shark is what is that? Yeah?\""]
["03:16,460","03:19,060","\"Let's catch that whoo\""]
["03:19,060","03:24,580","\"Oh, you can't you can't catch it yet. Oh, I'm not good enough to catch oceanic fair\""]
["03:24,580","03:27,420","\"You just don't have the gear for it. This is really a\""]
["03:27,420","03:34,740","\"Something Lyle. It's really neat. Mumbi edge of my seat. Okay, so that means I just can't catch it gotcha\""]
["03:34,740","03:39,420","\"That's a no that's a no means no sort of situation issue\""]
["03:39,420","03:41,700","\"There's something glowing out there\""]
["03:41,700","03:48,380","\"Glow it are you better get the fuck back before the fog rolls in well, it's just a little fog right now\""]
["03:48,380","03:51,420","\"No, it's gonna turn into a lot of fog. Oh\""]
["03:51,420","03:58,660","\"This is gonna be bad. Oh look at squids who you can squid with ease here\""]
["03:58,660","04:01,420","\"narrow squid\""]
["04:01,420","04:08,340","\"Yeah, put them there not that every every fish has kind of a slightly different mini game should I go out toward one of these lights?\""]
["04:08,340","04:13,060","\"Oh, it seems the fog has rolled in all right. I'll go back\""]
["04:13,580","04:16,200","\"What's that there though something glowing?\""]
["04:16,200","04:18,880","\"I'm gonna check that out on my way in. Oh\""]
["04:18,880","04:24,180","\"Fuck can you crash into rocks? Probably you sure can wow oh\""]
["04:24,180","04:28,580","\"Yeah, what does that mean at the pack? Oh is a whole thing?\""]
["04:28,580","04:35,460","\"Yeah, this is like a little a story you can you can reveal what she had his rocks which out oh oh\""]
["04:35,460","04:38,500","\"God yeah, who?\""]
["04:38,500","04:41,460","\"What kind of lighthouse is this what is that oh?\""]
["04:42,300","04:44,660","\"Oh, Tomar. What the hell get back?\""]
["04:44,660","04:51,580","\"I'm trying that was very risky. There's an ominous red glow about oh, there's a weird eye\""]
["04:51,580","04:59,020","\"So that just signifies that he's tired. It's red. I read. Yeah, the eye is like your panic meter. Oh\""]
["04:59,020","05:01,740","\"my god\""]
["05:01,740","05:04,660","\"Oh, I did it. Yeah pull up to the\""]
["05:04,660","05:09,780","\"You step onto the dock a greater borrow the bears waiting nearby\""]
["05:10,620","05:13,160","\"Ah, I see you've returned in one piece.\""]
["05:13,160","05:14,160","\"Very good.\""]
["05:14,160","05:17,780","\"Before you head off to town, we should discuss the matter of your boat.\""]
["05:17,780","05:20,860","\"As I mentioned earlier, your old boat was too badly damaged to be repaired.\""]
["05:20,860","05:25,300","\"However, I'm more than happy to sell you that replacement vessel, yours to own.\""]
["05:25,300","05:28,460","\"So to recap, you'll need to sell fish at the local market, paying off your debt and\""]
["05:28,460","05:31,260","\"in turn, keeping the population fed and satisfied.\""]
["05:31,260","05:32,260","\"Understand?\""]
["05:32,260","05:33,260","\"Yeah, so he's Tom Nook.\""]
["05:33,260","05:34,980","\"Where do I send the fish?\""]
["05:34,980","05:39,940","\"Our our star star star star local fishmonger will praise you and it partes you\""]
["05:39,940","05:46,620","\"He'll praise you and purchase you call you a good girl pat your head. All right. Let's go to your daddy's little com pet\""]
["05:46,620","05:51,580","\"I'm daddy's little com back. You enter the squalid shack on the fringe of the marketplace\""]
["05:51,580","06:00,060","\"He's disgusting a million smell of fish fills the air flies bud buzz haphazardly a rounded downcast man behind the counter\""]
["06:00,060","06:02,060","\"I'll voice him cuz he looks like me\""]
["06:02,580","06:06,180","\"You're the new fisherman a surprise. I've had a new one so fast\""]
["06:06,180","06:09,780","\"It's pretty good for you were the bald guy with the beard. Yeah\""]
["06:09,780","06:15,300","\"So let's see what you got I got a lot of fish\""]
["06:15,300","06:18,860","\"To sell all of it and should I yeah?\""]
["06:18,860","06:21,380","\"There we go take the fishies\""]
["06:21,380","06:24,260","\"Okay, so what do these hooks mean?\""]
["06:24,260","06:29,740","\"So you see how different spots in your inventory have like different icons\""]
["06:29,940","06:37,180","\"Yeah, so if you get a fishing rod you can only put it in that spot or if you get an engine you can only put it in that spot\""]
["06:37,180","06:38,900","\"With the rudder oh I get it\""]
["06:38,900","06:42,700","\"So it can be used to hold fish and you'll have more space if you don't load it up\""]
["06:42,700","06:49,900","\"But that's like the only place you can put certain type of equipment. So I got a good lamp. Should I go get our food? I?\""]
["06:49,900","06:55,400","\"Would love that. Oh, yeah, who the mayor's standing outside the fishmongers store\""]
["06:56,740","06:58,500","\"I'm Chris\""]
["06:58,500","07:01,840","\"Excellent work. I have no doubt you'll be able to provide for this town\""]
["07:01,840","07:08,400","\"Look here. I found it down by the docks. I'm sure someone like you could make something out of it. Why don't you take it?\""]
["07:08,400","07:11,140","\"Collect what is this a research party?\""]
["07:11,140","07:13,980","\"That you can use to\""]
["07:13,980","07:16,560","\"get new engines and fishing poles and\""]
["07:16,560","07:21,980","\"There's shit in your mouth. All right. There's a ship right as you're a fucking fish guy\""]
["07:21,980","07:23,380","\"I can make improvements.\""]
["07:23,380","07:24,580","\"Nana, Nana, Nana, Nana.\""]
["07:24,580","07:28,300","\"- Yeah, that's what I'd expect of a ship ride, okay.\""]
["07:28,300","07:29,260","\"- Yeah.\""]
["07:29,260","07:33,100","\"- Ooh, she's got better fishing rods.\""]
["07:33,100","07:36,460","\"Yeah, let's get the big, the big weighted line.\""]
["07:36,460","07:38,580","\"- You wanna wait and save up for that one?\""]
["07:38,580","07:40,900","\"- Oh, I see, I can afford this now, huh?\""]
["07:40,900","07:41,940","\"- Yeah, you can.\""]
["07:41,940","07:44,460","\"- I'd rather be able to get more fishing out.\""]
["07:44,460","07:45,300","\"- All righty.\""]
["07:45,300","07:47,340","\"- The bigger the equipment,\""]
["07:47,340","07:49,900","\"the longer it takes to install some plan ahead.\""]
["07:49,900","07:51,780","\"- Oh, here.\""]
["07:51,780","07:54,180","\"He's just learning how things work around here.\""]
["07:54,180","07:57,780","\"So you can rest till morning.\""]
["07:57,780","07:58,180","\"Yeah.\""]
["07:58,180","07:59,280","\"What about research?\""]
["07:59,280","08:00,780","\"Oh, OK, so yeah.\""]
["08:00,780","08:05,480","\"I know if I didn't figure this out until embarrassingly long.\""]
["08:05,480","08:06,180","\"If you press L.\""]
["08:06,180","08:07,480","\"L. B and RB.\""]
["08:07,480","08:08,480","\"Oh, yeah.\""]
["08:08,480","08:10,480","\"So you can you can research like engines.\""]
["08:10,480","08:12,380","\"So you can watch RB in the chief.\""]
["08:12,380","08:14,380","\"Yeah, improved outboard engine.\""]
["08:14,380","08:15,480","\"That guy's still making them.\""]

["08:48,180","08:56,360","\"He just took some randos order and gave it to us and then some dipshit who orders salads from a hook burger got actual burgers\""]
["08:56,360","09:00,740","\"That's my bigger issue who orders a fucking salad from a burger place\""]
["09:00,740","09:05,220","\"There's a big ass salad. You make them make them do it again. Yeah\""]
["09:05,220","09:10,960","\"Actually demand they do it again and after all that we get some stupid salad\""]
["09:10,960","09:14,980","\"Maybe this is the universe giving us a sign that we're gonna ignore\""]
["09:16,060","09:18,060","\"All right, I'm undocking sorry editor\""]
["09:18,060","09:24,580","\"So speaking of docking and then want to bring this up, but it's better say something normal\""]
["09:24,580","09:31,060","\"You're just always you're making a lot of friends who are circumcised for somebody with a\""]
["09:31,060","09:40,900","\"Uncirc what I'm just I'm just making an observation so what it's it's like it's like you know those dudes that like always add like\""]

["09:44,660","09:49,660","\"Yeah, you seem to make like like 15 circumcised friends to everyone\""]
["09:49,660","09:52,340","\"It's because of geography\""]
["09:52,340","09:55,300","\"Where I am I\""]
["09:55,300","10:00,780","\"Alright, that sounds like an excuse, but I'll drop it if you really want me to the land of split tips\""]

["10:03,740","10:08,980","\"That's just a funny word. I don't I appreciate the the split\""]
["10:09,740","10:16,740","\"The vivid imagery you're wasting a lot of spaces by doing I don't know if it's a waste if if I'm putting if it's fish\""]
["10:16,740","10:23,080","\"It's delicious yummy how we're not gonna be able to fit out of the other better fish if you do this kind of shallow the stuff\""]
["10:23,080","10:25,120","\"No, there's some mermaid that's a shark. Oh\""]
["10:25,120","10:28,600","\"That's just a bottle. Oh, go get it\""]
["10:28,600","10:33,580","\"Where's the button I press to go faster? Yeah, I know I have to buy up\""]
["10:33,580","10:38,520","\"Have you guys ever heard of that weird Disney Channel movie where a little boy turns into a mermaid?\""]

["10:43,420","10:47,720","\"No, I don't know what it was called\""]
["10:47,720","10:52,400","\"But I remember there was a part in the movie where his skin gets really sticky and he sticks to the roof like spider-man\""]
["10:52,400","10:58,960","\"Is there any disadvantage to him being a mermaid or is it all cool it was like\""]
["10:58,960","11:05,100","\"All I'm having him like ET no, I just remember actually maybe they were at the end of it\""]
["11:05,100","11:09,820","\"He escapes the real world and into the ocean and he meets his mom who was a mermaid to\""]
["11:09,820","11:14,060","\"So it was like I might not be able to hold much more it back\""]
["11:14,060","11:18,380","\"It was like a reveal that is a mermaid is another one of these in what?\""]
["11:18,380","11:22,220","\"Tomer I told you that and you just you just spat in my mouth and you went ha ha\""]

["11:26,860","11:28,860","\"But it gives you room to\""]
["11:31,060","11:38,980","\"You could probably Tetris this if you were you know like you've really always a good that sort of thing. I don't know. Oh dear\""]
["11:38,980","11:45,520","\"Yeah in the corner. Yeah that top fish seems like it's taking up space that it doesn't need to\""]

["11:50,180","11:56,960","\"Yes, now you're starting to get it now. I'm cooking with gas now you understand\""]
