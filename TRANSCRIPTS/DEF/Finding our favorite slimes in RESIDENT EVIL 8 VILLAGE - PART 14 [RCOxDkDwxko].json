["05:03,520","05:06,600","\"If we learned anything from that boat, it's that maybe.\""]
["05:06,600","05:14,400","\"I'm surprised that didn't take off Ethan's leg knowing his fucking luck.\""]
["05:14,400","05:16,300","\"Nice.\""]
["05:16,300","05:17,760","\"So I can just do this right here.\""]
["05:17,760","05:24,240","\"You can adjust the windmill and that will power the button and that button will open the\""]
