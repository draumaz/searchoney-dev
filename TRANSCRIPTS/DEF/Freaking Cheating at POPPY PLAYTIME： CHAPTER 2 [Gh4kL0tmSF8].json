["05:01,400","05:02,400","\"Oh, this thing.\""]
["05:02,400","05:04,000","\"- You wrap it around.\""]
["05:04,000","05:04,840","\"- Oh yeah.\""]
["05:04,840","05:05,680","\"- It's one of those flaxes.\""]
["05:05,680","05:08,200","\"- Give it your iconic Chris wrap around.\""]
["05:08,200","05:10,940","\"You have to do the thing where you stretch your arm around those two.\""]
["05:10,940","05:12,640","\"Oh, you know what?\""]
["05:12,640","05:14,240","\"You probably have to start with that step.\""]
["05:14,240","05:14,800","\"Okay.\""]
["05:14,800","05:17,880","\"So just only use your, your blue hand for this, right?\""]
["05:17,880","05:18,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:18,400","05:22,520","\"So so you need to do that with the power into that sort of God.\""]
["05:22,520","05:24,240","\"Sometimes it just doesn't fucking land good.\""]
["05:24,240","05:26,400","\"So grab that with your blue hand.\""]
["05:26,400","05:27,280","\"Oh, right.\""]
["05:27,280","05:27,640","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:27,640","05:29,080","\"Then you turn those knobs on.\""]
["05:29,080","05:29,440","\"Yeah.\""]
["05:29,440","05:31,040","\"So and then jump down.\""]
["05:31,040","05:32,720","\"Can't I just do this?\""]
["05:32,720","05:36,040","\"I think you cheated.\""]
["05:36,680","05:38,480","\"Well, that's how you speed run.\""]

["05:39,280","05:39,980","\"What?\""]
["05:39,980","05:40,640","\"Did I really?\""]
["05:40,640","05:42,000","\"Who cares?\""]
["05:42,000","05:42,680","\"Did I really?\""]
["05:42,680","05:43,720","\"I actually think so.\""]
["05:43,720","05:45,600","\"I think you might have, maybe.\""]
["05:45,600","05:46,400","\"No.\""]
["05:46,400","05:49,400","\"I mean, you got a little don't get sound, so you're good.\""]
["05:49,400","05:50,800","\"Wait, did I really just cheat?\""]
["05:50,800","05:51,560","\"I think you did.\""]
["05:51,560","05:53,840","\"I don't think you cheated as much as you actually just\""]
["05:53,840","05:55,160","\"found a new way to solve it.\""]
["05:55,160","05:58,320","\"If anything, you just found a new way to solve the problem.\""]
["05:58,320","05:59,920","\"I guess so.\""]
["05:59,920","06:00,920","\"Well, OK.\""]
["06:00,920","06:02,600","\"It's not cheating if it's in the game.\""]
["06:02,600","06:04,240","\"It's like that Breath of the Wild puzzle\""]
["06:04,240","06:06,480","\"where they have that elaborate ball puzzle.\""]
["06:06,480","06:11,540","\"Oh yeah, and then you just like flip the thing upside down and smack it in the fucking wall. I remember that.\""]
["06:11,540","06:15,220","\"Who the fuck is gonna do the normal way? It's so dumb. It is literally-\""]
["06:15,220","06:16,480","\"The lights will turn off.\""]
["06:16,480","06:17,860","\"Exploit the physics.\""]

["06:20,240","06:22,380","\"Okay, so I want you to-\""]
["06:22,380","06:23,540","\"The lights turn on.\""]
["06:23,540","06:26,120","\"You can look around, but cannot move.\""]
["06:26,120","06:27,980","\"So when the lights are on, you can't move.\""]
["06:27,980","06:29,060","\"When the lights are on.\""]
["06:29,060","06:30,560","\"When the lights turn back on.\""]
["06:30,560","06:32,160","\"Again, this feels like the-\""]
["06:32,160","06:32,560","\"It's so-\""]
["06:32,560","06:33,260","\"It's like red light green light.\""]
