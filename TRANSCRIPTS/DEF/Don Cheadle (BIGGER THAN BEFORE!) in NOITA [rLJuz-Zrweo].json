["00:34,680","00:38,720","\"Infinity blade was cool for like a phone game. It was kind of like a punch-out type thing\""]
["00:38,720","00:43,120","\"Yeah, with road legacy you'd actually get to choose between like three different like\""]
["00:43,120","00:49,320","\"Progeny and they'd all have different like defects and and they could be different classes and stuff\""]

["01:22,680","01:28,020","\"Yeah, not bad for an early game weapon especially because they don't have nearly as much bounce back as the big ones\""]
["01:28,020","01:35,080","\"There's one called the gigas oblay that cruelly just follows you so it tries to kill you when you fire it. Oh god\""]

["03:00,360","03:06,760","\"Is that LeBron James like hates fun? Yeah, it's so it's just like Luna tunes. You can't be having fun\""]
["03:06,760","03:12,760","\"I need I need to do LeBron James things. I don't know if it's a spoiler. What he's trying to do in the movie or if anyone fucking cares\""]

["03:32,200","03:33,760","\"Are we allowed to spoil Space Jam?\""]
["03:33,760","03:37,760","\"Do you think it'll be long enough from then until the time this comes out that people\""]

["03:38,760","03:41,080","\"What are you playing to spoil about it?\""]
["03:41,080","03:45,840","\"It's literally at the end of the movie, but okay, I'll say it and you can cut it out if\""]
["03:45,840","03:48,680","\"you think it's too early to spoil that piece of shit.\""]
["03:48,680","03:50,760","\"I think it deserves spoiling.\""]
["03:50,760","03:52,840","\"The bad guy in that movie is Don Cheetah.\""]
["03:52,840","03:53,840","\"Even if it's both.\""]
["03:53,840","03:58,880","\"And then at the end of the movie, he goes like super form, but he just turns into a slightly\""]
["03:58,880","04:00,080","\"bigger CGI Don Cheetah.\""]
["04:00,080","04:01,080","\"It's so bad.\""]
["04:01,080","04:02,080","\"It was terrible.\""]
["04:02,080","04:08,920","\"He's like slightly shorter than LeBron James, and then he turns into a big CGI Don Cheetah\""]
["04:08,920","04:12,080","\"who's like slightly taller than LeBron James.\""]
["04:12,080","04:15,960","\"He goes from like 6'2\"\" to like 7'8\"\".\""]
["04:15,960","04:19,640","\"Even his basic motivation is so like bizarrely unclear.\""]
["04:19,640","04:23,000","\"He's like, \"\"And then I'll be the most popular algorithm.\"\"\""]
["04:23,000","04:24,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:24,000","04:29,440","\"It's like, \"\"Oh, that's your goal in all this is to be the most popular algorithm.\"\"\""]
["04:29,440","04:32,200","\"Why would it all be like, \"\"Oh, it's so fucking stupid.\"\"\""]
["04:32,200","04:36,200","\"It really does feel like a script that was written by a boardroom.\""]
["04:36,200","04:37,200","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:37,200","04:43,580","\"Yeah, also it removes the kind of magic like okay space jam one is really shit and stupid\""]
["04:43,580","04:46,160","\"But at least it made kids go like oh bugs buddy\""]
["04:46,160","04:53,080","\"What their cartoons are real in this movie and implies that they are just in like they're just code inside of a server\""]
["04:53,080","04:56,040","\"Why the fuck would I care about them? Yeah? Yeah, it's like\""]
["04:56,040","05:02,380","\"Take it away the magic for kids just a reminder. These are all of Warner Brothers intellectual properties\""]
["05:02,380","05:04,360","\"server\""]
["05:04,360","05:06,360","\"It was so embarrassing.\""]
["05:06,360","05:08,360","\"So soulless.\""]
["05:08,360","05:15,360","\"Like Space Jam versus literally aliens from space trying to try to kidnap Michael Jordan\""]
["05:15,360","05:19,360","\"to like make him be like a moon slave or something.\""]
["05:19,360","05:21,360","\"Yeah, that was a cool idea.\""]
["05:21,360","05:23,360","\"I get some Mars slave.\""]
["05:23,360","05:27,360","\"I mean the thing about Space Jam 1 is Space Jam 1 was shameless but it was just like it\""]
["05:27,360","05:30,360","\"tried to use two popular things to get you to watch a movie.\""]
["05:30,360","05:36,540","\"Yeah, whereas Space Jam 2 itself is like fuck you you'll watch it and here's a bunch of advertisements and\""]
["05:36,540","05:41,720","\"Like they have the part where all of the big like characters come in and sit down to watch the game\""]
["05:41,720","05:47,320","\"And then they're just on like an animated loop for literally 40 minutes straight doing the exact same thing in the background\""]
["05:47,320","05:51,500","\"Whatever you look them. There's a weird penny wise up front. That looks nothing like penny wise\""]
["05:51,500","05:58,220","\"God it was bad. They didn't fucking try it feels like yeah when you go to like the Universal Studios like Halloween\""]
["05:58,220","06:06,380","\"Horror Nights show yes, and every and it's all the like the kind of like like they're all actors that probably only work there\""]
["06:06,380","06:08,940","\"seasonally and like\""]
["06:08,940","06:10,200","\"like there it's like\""]
["06:10,200","06:13,780","\"I know mr. Burns and that's Beetlejuice and it's like\""]
["06:13,780","06:21,320","\"Except they did that in like a movie that had like a like a hundred twenty million dollar budget or what was the budget of that movie?\""]
["06:21,320","06:24,140","\"Probably too much it it looks expensive\""]
["06:24,860","06:27,140","\"Also another thing is the animation sucked in it.\""]
["06:27,140","06:29,620","\"- Oh yeah, I didn't like any of the 2D animation.\""]
["06:29,620","06:30,980","\"- Yeah, even the 2D sucked in it.\""]
["06:30,980","06:32,860","\"- It was really like stiff and pose to pose\""]
["06:32,860","06:35,780","\"and like didn't look, didn't feel like Looney Tunes.\""]
["06:35,780","06:37,460","\"- The first movie looked way better.\""]
["06:37,460","06:38,780","\"And I don't even like the first movie.\""]
["06:38,780","06:39,620","\"It sucks too.\""]
["06:39,620","06:41,980","\"- Like I'm not saying it's terrible, but it's like,\""]
["06:41,980","06:44,340","\"- It's pretty bad, but it's not good.\""]
["06:44,340","06:45,180","\"- It's not great.\""]
["06:45,180","06:46,700","\"- Like I remember loving it as a kid\""]
["06:46,700","06:48,820","\"and I watched it semi-recently and I was like,\""]
["06:48,820","06:50,900","\"\"\"Man, this is, it's bad.\"\"\""]
["06:50,900","06:53,940","\"But it's 50 million times better than the new one.\""]
["06:53,940","06:55,160","\"- This gen one still looks like a,\""]
["06:55,160","06:58,940","\"it does look a million times better than the new one.\""]
["06:58,940","07:01,640","\"- Do you like how Bill Murray comes in and saves the day?\""]
["07:01,640","07:04,260","\"- No, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,\""]
["07:04,260","07:07,180","\"- And like, without the context of like,\""]
["07:07,180","07:09,100","\"Ghostbusters being really popular\""]
["07:09,100","07:11,380","\"at that specific moment in time,\""]
["07:11,380","07:13,780","\"like that guy's literally not a character.\""]
["07:13,780","07:15,220","\"- Yeah, yeah, the joke, like,\""]
["07:15,220","07:19,140","\"I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture, like.\""]
["07:19,140","07:20,380","\"- You be Bill Murray?\""]
["07:20,380","07:22,540","\"- No, but that was the joke, wasn't it?\""]
["07:22,540","07:25,140","\"where the little Danny DeVito alien goes,\""]
["07:25,140","07:26,740","\"I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this\""]
["07:26,740","07:27,740","\"because as if he didn't plot.\""]
["07:27,740","07:28,740","\"- Oh, I forgot that.\""]
["07:28,740","07:31,420","\"- As if to apply that Bill Murray's there.\""]
["07:31,420","07:33,180","\"Dan Aykroyd must be there too.\""]
["07:33,180","07:35,580","\"- I was a smelly little kid that didn't get nothing.\""]

["07:47,260","07:48,700","\"- Dollar budget.\""]
["07:48,700","07:51,020","\"- That's like almost a Marvel movie, right?\""]
["07:51,020","07:58,780","\"Like like endgame would have been like 250 or something. God. I don't know maybe I but that's mostly just paying the actors in this case\""]
["07:58,780","08:01,780","\"What did that that money went to LeBron James?\""]
["08:01,780","08:08,300","\"Like what remarkable it's like Don Cheetel and like what like Sarah Silverman had like a five-minute cameo\""]
["08:08,300","08:14,380","\"It's like yeah, I don't think that even had a lot of famous actors and it seemed like it all would have gone into the animation and and effects\""]
["08:14,380","08:20,780","\"Okay, so endgame was 356 so it's like it's like it's like half of an endgame\""]
["08:20,780","08:28,820","\"but still still a lot more than I have right now I'm so proud of you I know I\""]
