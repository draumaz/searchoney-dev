["10:41,820","10:44,340","\"on screen, and you have to read a million things at once,\""]
["10:44,340","10:45,180","\"it's just not worth it.\""]
["10:45,180","10:49,580","\"change the back to English from what I've heard so far it seems like this was\""]

["11:06,660","11:14,420","\"a loop and cool because he's a loop um not it seems he's very like uptight at\""]
["11:14,420","11:17,200","\"Beginning of this one. I never really read him like that\""]
["11:17,200","11:22,480","\"Like that up tight at the beginning of seven just cuz it's your imagination doing a lot of the heavy lifting\""]
["11:22,480","11:26,980","\"Yeah, but in this one. He's like a fucking like leave me to fuck alone, please\""]
["11:26,980","11:32,620","\"You just want us to get paid right now, right? Yeah, I mean it is the same in the original\""]
["11:32,620","11:35,140","\"It's just like in every other way cuz I was a stupid little kid\""]
["11:35,140","11:40,260","\"You know, I'd really is like a dick at the beginning of the game\""]
["11:41,340","11:43,620","\"Yeah, I've seen a lot of people be like he's so fucking a lot\""]
["11:43,620","11:44,660","\"How am I supposed to like this guy?\""]
["11:44,660","11:48,860","\"I like him because he's cool and this came out in the night. He's been being a dick. He's super cool\""]
["11:48,860","11:53,900","\"It's because of his cool shoulder pad with the little doohickey's poking out of it\""]
["11:53,900","11:57,300","\"Yeah, the fuck they are yeah, I got screws on him\""]
["11:57,300","12:00,860","\"So wait are you saying that he doesn't look like this in the original because he looks pretty much\""]
["12:00,860","12:06,500","\"What okay, it's just it's like now he's more lean and like anime and like beautiful\""]
["12:06,500","12:10,660","\"But in the original I always could thought of him as like a street punk kind of a guy, but that's just me\""]
["12:10,660","12:19,320","\"It's me like blocky and buff. Yeah blocky buff big cocks mall cocks. Yeah two cocks my toes is out of themselves\""]
["12:19,320","12:22,660","\"one slightly smaller than the other I\""]
["12:22,660","12:31,460","\"Really think they nailed the feel or the look of this whole first area. I\""]
["12:31,460","12:39,660","\"Do you want to stay it looks real good? I've played this part and it looks good. Did I ever tell you about how I originally played this game?\""]
["12:39,660","12:46,220","\"Yeah, cuz I didn't have a PlayStation and I had a memory you had no memory card, right?\""]
["12:46,220","12:49,020","\"No, no, no, I that might be someone else's story\""]
["12:49,020","12:55,980","\"I played it on PC like so it was like a year later when it came out on PC, but I didn't have a graphics card\""]
["12:55,980","13:01,560","\"So I like the game just crawled on my computer after I installed it\""]
["13:01,560","13:09,460","\"So the only way I could play it and I was desperate to play it was to run it at like 320 by like 240 or so\""]
["13:09,460","13:15,620","\"Like basically it was like a tiny box in the middle of my like already not very big 15 inch monitor\""]
["13:15,620","13:20,560","\"And I played it like that for the entire game. I'm sorry Tomar you missed out. I\""]
["13:20,560","13:23,140","\"Mean I got to play it\""]
["13:23,140","13:29,100","\"Just point what you you played the PC version had shitty mid-eye files. Yeah, it did and yeah\""]
["13:29,100","13:35,940","\"But it installed the Yamaha like MIDI engine. So I think it was basically the same one used on the PlayStation\""]
["13:36,980","13:42,580","\"Didn't do that for me, but it would do it would run whatever mid-eye engine you had selected as your default\""]
["13:42,580","13:48,260","\"So you could make it sound really weird by using the like the built-in windows instrument set\""]
["13:48,260","13:51,820","\"You could like drag in like a rugrats blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\""]
["13:51,820","13:56,860","\"Dude what bigs look so fucking cool in this game\""]

["17:43,140","17:45,700","\"Why he would have been like if they just got mr. T\""]
["17:45,700","17:58,820","\"your tea. Pretty much the same honestly. I wish they got Mr. T. You really hear that.\""]
["17:58,820","18:09,860","\"Get help. I would. That's perfect. That is like the chemistry they had in the original\""]
["18:09,860","18:14,900","\"game. I don't know. I like that interpretation. There is a lot of very charming moments.\""]
["18:14,900","18:16,900","\"We'll say that later\""]
["18:16,900","18:18,940","\"Yeah, it seems like they nailed the\""]

["18:28,320","18:38,860","\"Don't aim that at me\""]
["18:41,620","18:44,740","\"Come on Barrett always treat a gun like it's loaded because it is\""]
["18:44,740","18:53,260","\"There are some places a sword just doesn't he have to shoot little bits of his muscles every time he fires that thing\""]
["18:53,260","18:56,260","\"Is that is that canonically how that gun works?\""]
["18:56,260","19:04,900","\"Absolutely not but it'd be cool. He's just shooting shards of coagulated blood and and and muscle\""]
["19:04,900","19:10,420","\"See the way see the way his arm leads up into the into the Gatling gun\""]
["19:10,420","19:16,260","\"Those were all of his fingers inside that really long really spindly. He's just spinning his fingers around\""]
["19:16,260","19:22,780","\"Anyone can do it with enough practice. Yeah, I get the control my best friend\""]
["19:22,780","19:36,100","\"Can you actually take your controller? Yeah, you can you actually have to right here. I don't like to shoot these things down\""]
["19:38,140","19:44,140","\"I've been avoiding learning too much about this game because I wanted to be surprised, but here I am getting surprised.\""]

["19:45,140","19:49,140","\"When I played this, this felt really awkward to me.\""]
["19:49,140","19:53,140","\"You've played a lot more of it, Chris. Does it get better later on?\""]
["19:53,140","19:56,140","\"I don't like controlling Barrett, honestly. He's boring.\""]
["19:56,140","19:59,140","\"Yeah, I really didn't like controlling him.\""]
["19:59,140","20:02,140","\"Is it just him specifically, though?\""]
["20:02,140","20:06,140","\"Or does switching off of Cloud always kind of feel weird?\""]
["20:06,140","20:09,860","\"I usually just prefer being cloud just because\""]
["20:09,860","20:12,900","\"Like slaying in the shit feels good like that\""]
["20:12,900","20:17,380","\"Yeah, but when you're bar you're just waiting around for a stupid triangle to charge\""]
["20:17,380","20:23,860","\"Yeah, I don't think there's any good ways to dodge it in this game, maybe I'm wrong\""]
["20:23,860","20:27,420","\"Yeah, so that that was what I was talking about where\""]
["20:27,420","20:32,980","\"It feels like you should be able to dodge more than you actually can\""]
["20:32,980","20:37,320","\"I think what you're just supposed to do is kind of take into account can I dodge this or not?\""]
["20:37,320","20:41,060","\"And if you're not able to dodge it you're just supposed to block it like take the\""]
["20:41,060","20:45,680","\"Would you say that this is based more or less on like Kingdom Hearts combat system?\""]
["20:45,680","20:52,540","\"It's super close. Also, I think the reason you can't dodge stuff that good is because they want to give a reason to use potions and stuff\""]
["20:52,540","20:56,820","\"Yeah, no, it's invincibility frame dodge everything there be no real need for potions\""]
["20:56,820","21:00,900","\"It's definitely still an RPG, but I feel like the illusion is there\""]
["21:01,180","21:09,180","\"You know it still has the feeling of like this attack is a tangible thing that I can get around and then you can't kind of\""]
["21:09,180","21:11,700","\"It that just kind of felt bad to me\""]
["21:11,700","21:18,260","\"There are certain things I can't stand like there's like flame throwers later and I have no idea what the fuck you're supposed to even do\""]
["21:18,260","21:19,740","\"I just don't even get it you do it. You know\""]
["21:19,740","21:23,640","\"If they added a game mode that just made it like dark souls\""]
["21:23,640","21:27,540","\"Do you think that'd be just a cool little thing to have I'd enjoy it?\""]
["21:28,140","21:33,800","\"You have a block button I think are one blocks, but against fire is still like you still taking shit tons of damage\""]
["21:33,800","21:38,540","\"I don't know yeah, I think you're just supposed to take shit tons of damage, but less of it by blocking\""]
["21:38,540","21:41,040","\"I think that's the idea. I could be totally wrong\""]
["21:41,040","21:44,080","\"But that was the vibe that I got playing it the one time oh\""]
["21:44,080","21:48,740","\"Dude shipping containers, what could they be full of?\""]
