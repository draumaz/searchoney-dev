["06:11,900","06:15,140","\"Like, the closest thing I can think of to this\""]
["06:15,140","06:16,940","\"is like God hand kind of.\""]
["06:16,940","06:18,180","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:18,180","06:19,820","\"- Drug money, dirty money.\""]

["06:21,780","06:24,540","\"in the world, like it's kind of got a little bit of Sekiro\""]
["06:24,540","06:27,260","\"and it's got a little bit of like the Batman Arkham juice.\""]
["06:27,260","06:28,620","\"- I also wish there was like,\""]
["06:28,620","06:31,220","\"I wish you were fucking cave in people's heads and you know.\""]

["06:32,700","06:33,540","\"- Yeah.\""]
["06:33,540","06:34,540","\"Well, that would be fun.\""]
["06:34,540","06:35,540","\"Well, that would be cool.\""]
["06:35,540","06:38,180","\"Let's just walk into an open elevator shaft, I guess.\""]
["06:38,180","06:40,260","\"Don't worry, that can be pretty dangerous.\""]
["06:40,260","06:42,980","\"Well, this guy wanted to do it.\""]
["06:42,980","06:45,020","\"This guy wanted to do it?\""]
["06:45,020","06:47,380","\"Punch that dude.\""]
["06:47,380","06:49,820","\"Yeah, yeah.\""]
["06:49,820","06:53,460","\"So when you do those takedowns, you get a little bit health-backed.\""]
["06:53,460","06:56,380","\"Oh, yeah, no, I got even a thing that made me get extra health.\""]
["06:56,380","06:57,860","\"I don't know, man.\""]
["06:57,860","07:03,380","\"I feel like violence is just regularly never the answer, you know?\""]
["07:03,380","07:07,380","\"Name one set of orders that was defined without violence\""]
["07:07,380","07:09,940","\"set of orders borders\""]
["07:09,940","07:14,320","\"Think about that something that was defined without violence you can go with the bookstore\""]
["07:14,320","07:16,320","\"I'll pretend like I didn't just say it and laugh\""]
["07:16,320","07:22,780","\"The bookstore. Yeah, there's a bookstore called borders use that joke. That's that's your joke use it\""]
["07:22,780","07:26,380","\"And I'll pretend like I didn't say it okay, but editor you have to cut it out\""]
["07:26,380","07:32,180","\"I'm getting old man editor you have to edit or we hypnotized you to never make a mistake at the beginning\""]
["07:32,180","07:34,660","\"I'm gonna get the editor all dizzy with you\""]
["07:34,660","07:49,220","\"So you have to not make a mistake Chris take your shot now or never okay\""]
["07:49,220","07:57,460","\"You are so on it pretty out there. I'm gonna pitch this to comedy\""]
["07:57,460","08:00,740","\"That's gonna be like the preview clip\""]
["08:00,740","08:04,020","\"You scroll over it on Netflix\""]
["08:04,020","08:09,160","\"No tough yes, I am I gotta pipe I\""]
["08:09,160","08:16,540","\"Gotta pipe, but I'm gonna blow it back okay, so those guys are like they're like secret sub bosses and if you beat them\""]
["08:16,540","08:18,500","\"you\""]
["08:18,500","08:22,820","\"You so your death counter kind of compounds. So the first time you die\""]
["08:22,820","08:25,780","\"It's like it takes one year second time it takes two years, etc\""]
["08:25,980","08:32,120","\"So those guys when you beat them it actually takes one of those years off like it doesn't make you younger\""]
["08:32,120","08:37,580","\"But the next time you die you will age see so next time you die you'll age two years\""]
["08:37,580","08:39,780","\"But if you beat him you'll only age one wow\""]
["08:39,780","08:47,580","\"Wait, so do you eventually just die of old age like what yeah, yeah when you hit 75 you die\""]
["08:47,580","08:50,740","\"That's game over. Yeah, oh my god\""]
["08:50,740","08:52,100","\"- But it's kind of like a roguelike.\""]
["08:52,100","08:54,700","\"So you can start over, basically,\""]
["08:54,700","08:57,140","\"whatever age Tomar beats this level at,\""]
["08:57,140","08:59,220","\"that's the age he's gonna start the next level at,\""]
["08:59,220","09:02,020","\"and if he redoes this level and does better,\""]
["09:02,020","09:05,300","\"then he'll start the next level younger.\""]
["09:05,300","09:06,140","\"That's how that works.\""]
["09:06,140","09:09,900","\"- I see, it's a little bit of pressure, I like it.\""]
["09:09,900","09:10,740","\"- Yeah, and if you-- - I feel like\""]
["09:10,740","09:12,380","\"feeling like there's stakes.\""]
["09:12,380","09:15,300","\"- If you go back and try to do the level better,\""]
["09:15,300","09:17,860","\"you can sort of--\""]
["09:17,860","09:19,860","\"- It's like Senwa, but real.\""]
["09:19,860","09:20,860","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:20,860","09:22,460","\"Tomar, what the hell did you just say?\""]
["09:22,460","09:24,460","\"I don't know, I agreed with it blindly.\""]
["09:24,460","09:27,460","\"You ever heard of the bellblades and what sacrifice?\""]
["09:27,460","09:28,460","\"Yeah, I don't.\""]
["09:28,460","09:29,460","\"I feel like it's a spoiler.\""]
["09:29,460","09:30,460","\"Don't say that.\""]
["09:30,460","09:33,860","\"I can't spoil a game that's like fucking 10 years old now.\""]
["09:33,860","09:35,860","\"It's a cool mechanic.\""]
["09:35,860","09:36,860","\"It's worth playing.\""]
["09:36,860","09:38,860","\"Ah, fine.\""]
["09:38,860","09:42,860","\"Editor, send Tomar a letter of resignation.\""]
