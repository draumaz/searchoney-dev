["11:02,640","11:05,440","\"- No, I was just saying that apparently there's like\""]
["11:05,440","11:09,160","\"an actual like, like, so in the actual hierarchy,\""]
["11:09,160","11:12,400","\"there's like a council of female bees\""]
["11:12,400","11:14,400","\"that sort of determine who the queen is,\""]
["11:14,400","11:17,320","\"which they kind of like designate from birth\""]
["11:17,320","11:19,960","\"by feeding a specific like,\""]
["11:19,960","11:23,880","\"the royal jelly that let them develop into a queen.\""]
["11:23,880","11:28,280","\"But yeah, then they're basically just like a spawn breeder thing.\""]
["11:28,280","11:30,120","\"- You forgot the most metal part of it.\""]
["11:30,120","11:34,560","\"They basically, they make like five or six queens in case like--\""]
["11:34,560","11:36,360","\"- Yeah, they have back on queens.\""]
["11:36,360","11:40,960","\"- Yeah, and then whichever one grows earliest gets out\""]
["11:40,960","11:43,280","\"and fucking eats all the other ones.\""]
["11:43,280","11:44,640","\"- Really? - Yeah.\""]
["11:44,640","11:48,400","\"- Yeah, whenever a queen is considered to be like getting weak,\""]
["11:48,400","11:55,600","\"the uh, the little like council of other female bees will like, they'll just kill it, they'll\""]
["11:55,600","11:59,280","\"suffocate it or they'll do the, they do something where they basically smother it.\""]
["11:59,280","12:00,320","\"- Give it a minute, yeah.\""]
["12:00,320","12:04,800","\"- They lay on it, push other body against it till it dies and then replace it with a new one.\""]
["12:04,800","12:09,840","\"- That's what I'm saying. If there's like an alien species that comes to earth and the society is\""]
["12:09,840","12:12,800","\"anything even approximating that, we are fucked.\""]
["12:14,400","12:23,040","\"But I'm just saying, yeah, to call it a queen is, is it has no power. It's just a tool of like the little council.\""]
["12:23,040","12:27,920","\"Oh, that's not necessarily true because it poops out all the other ones.\""]
["12:27,920","12:32,000","\"Yeah, but like I said, it's just a breeding machine. It has no authority.\""]
["12:32,000","12:38,400","\"It has no authority over other bees, but over the realm of man, if it can create bees, then it has authority in,\""]
["12:38,400","12:42,640","\"in so far as it can exert force over other aspects of nature.\""]
["12:43,200","12:44,620","\"Wouldn't you agree Telmar?\""]
["12:44,620","12:48,540","\"I suppose I suppose, yeah, as a creator it is.\""]
["12:48,540","12:51,500","\"It is powerful in its own way.\""]
["12:51,500","12:53,200","\"Can't have bees without a queen.\""]
