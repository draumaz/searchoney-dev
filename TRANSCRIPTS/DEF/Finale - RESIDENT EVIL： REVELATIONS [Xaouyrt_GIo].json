["13:51,820","13:58,620","\"Now I would be sad if that was true and it would make me cry every now and again like a game\""]
["13:58,620","14:03,440","\"We'll just have a character that's so hated that they'll do that and then they'll just like have an enemy\""]
["14:03,440","14:07,740","\"That's just got like their head on their on their fucking arm or something\""]
["14:07,740","14:10,820","\"I feel like I've seen that but I can't remember any examples. Do you remember any?\""]

["14:39,060","14:42,820","\"It's kind of one-dimensional, like, at its best.\""]
