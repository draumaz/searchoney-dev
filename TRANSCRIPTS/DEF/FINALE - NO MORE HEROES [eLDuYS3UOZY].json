["00:01,520","00:03,760","\"- It almost hit that Wii Sportswoman.\""]
["00:03,760","00:05,920","\"And now she's running away from you.\""]
["00:05,920","00:08,160","\"- Actually Chris, have you played Wii Sports on the channel?\""]
["00:08,160","00:08,920","\"- No.\""]
["00:08,920","00:10,400","\"- Did you ever thought about it?\""]
["00:10,400","00:11,240","\"- Nah.\""]
["00:11,240","00:13,240","\"- Ah, you gotta admit it'd be awesome.\""]
["00:13,240","00:14,720","\"- No interest.\""]
["00:14,720","00:17,120","\"- Oh, you don't like Wii Sports?\""]
["00:17,120","00:18,000","\"- Not really.\""]
["00:18,000","00:18,840","\"- What?\""]
["00:18,840","00:20,760","\"- It's the number one selling Wii game.\""]
["00:20,760","00:22,000","\"- It came with the Wii.\""]
["00:22,000","00:22,960","\"- Yeah, I know.\""]
["00:22,960","00:24,920","\"But the still market down is the best selling one,\""]
["00:24,920","00:26,360","\"which would have all the statistics.\""]
["00:26,360","00:27,800","\"[laughing]\""]
["00:27,800","00:28,880","\"- I don't know.\""]
["00:28,880","00:30,520","\"I always thought it was really boring.\""]
["00:30,520","00:32,640","\"What? You don't like throwing baseball?\""]
["00:32,640","00:33,940","\"You don't like throwing balls?\""]
["00:33,940","00:37,280","\"It was entertaining for the first day I had it, and I was like, \"\"Okay.\"\"\""]
["00:37,280","00:42,520","\"I remember people would be like playing it all the fucking time.\""]
["00:42,520","00:46,120","\"I played it a good amount, because I was just so fucking...\""]
["00:46,120","00:46,640","\"Oh, there we go.\""]
["00:46,640","00:48,920","\"I was so transfixed by the technology.\""]
["00:48,920","00:52,560","\"I was like, \"\"Can you imagine what they could do with this?\"\"\""]
["00:52,560","00:55,240","\"And then kind of never topped it.\""]
["00:55,240","00:56,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:56,240","01:03,340","\"Mmm. I will say I think the best game that uses gyro is probably like Splatoon because in Splatoon you aim around with this like a mouse\""]
["01:03,340","01:05,340","\"Oh, yeah, I never played Splatoon\""]
["01:05,340","01:10,140","\"Well, but you're a squid kid you're a squid now you're kidding that\""]
["01:10,140","01:13,300","\"You guys don't like Splatoon\""]
["01:13,300","01:15,180","\"They've really got into it. Yeah, me neither\""]
["01:15,180","01:22,520","\"Sorry, well, I just thought it was like a like a game for like little baby girls on their period\""]
["01:24,620","01:26,060","\"All video games.\""]
["01:26,060","01:26,580","\"No, I can't.\""]
["01:26,580","01:27,580","\"Just that one.\""]
["01:27,580","01:28,580","\"Whoa.\""]
["01:28,580","01:29,900","\"Did he go?\""]
["01:29,900","01:30,900","\"Oh!\""]
["01:30,900","01:31,980","\"Hey, like Mario.\""]
["01:31,980","01:35,260","\"All right, let's see what this guy has to frickin' say.\""]
["01:35,260","01:36,260","\"Hey, man.\""]
["01:36,260","01:37,660","\"It looked fine.\""]
["01:37,660","01:43,700","\"Just, if I'm thinking like first person shooters, I don't think Nintendo net code, you know,\""]
["01:43,700","01:45,180","\"like those two things don't.\""]
["01:45,180","01:47,580","\"It's the one Nintendo game that has good online, actually.\""]
["01:47,580","01:48,580","\"Is it really?\""]
["01:48,580","01:49,580","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:49,580","01:50,580","\"Okay.\""]
["01:50,580","01:54,180","\"I don't believe you, but I'm glad you think that.\""]
["01:54,180","01:55,300","\"Do you have a Switch Live?\""]
["01:55,300","01:56,140","\"- I do.\""]
["01:56,140","01:57,780","\"- Go home and play it.\""]
["01:57,780","02:00,060","\"- I feel like I permanently fucked up my dopamine\""]
["02:00,060","02:02,020","\"because I don't get enjoyment out of certain things\""]
["02:02,020","02:03,660","\"and I know Splatoon would just be one of them.\""]
["02:03,660","02:05,100","\"Like mowing lawns.\""]
["02:05,100","02:07,540","\"Yeah.\""]
["02:07,540","02:08,380","\"No, I don't know.\""]
["02:08,380","02:11,660","\"Like I really at this point,\""]
["02:11,660","02:16,660","\"like I don't know if I would, I would care either.\""]
["02:16,660","02:18,980","\"They might be fucked up, but I get enjoyment\""]
["02:18,980","02:21,860","\"out of like certain deaths in games 'cause it's just funny.\""]
["02:21,860","02:23,500","\"I don't know, I don't understand why.\""]
["02:23,500","02:27,700","\"See someone explode or scream before they die is what I enjoy.\""]
["02:27,700","02:33,420","\"So if it's someone getting covered in paint and disappearing, I'm like, oh, yeah, for shooters, especially.\""]
["02:33,420","02:36,300","\"Like, I mean, that's like the gears. I think that's fair.\""]
["02:36,300","02:38,700","\"But I also do think that's just because my brain is broken.\""]
["02:38,700","02:41,900","\"I don't get enjoyment out of board games either. I get really bored instantly.\""]
["02:41,900","02:43,700","\"- Board games have always sucked. - Board games have always sucked.\""]
["02:43,700","02:46,220","\"I don't care who wins. I don't care if I win.\""]
["02:46,220","02:49,940","\"You don't have the competitive win in your body guys.\""]
["02:50,940","02:53,940","\"Not really, I like chess because chess makes me be like,\""]
["02:53,940","02:57,380","\"think the entire way through and it is actually satisfying.\""]
["02:57,380","03:00,780","\"But when it comes to like random chance things, I really don't give a shit.\""]
["03:00,780","03:03,020","\"That's why Mario Party just pisses me off.\""]
["03:03,020","03:04,980","\"Mario Party pisses me off too.\""]
["03:04,980","03:07,300","\"That game is designed to piss you off.\""]
["03:07,300","03:09,580","\"I know, I get zero enjoyment out of it.\""]
["03:09,580","03:12,460","\"Well, that's just because it's fucking stupid.\""]
["03:12,460","03:16,340","\"It was cool back on Man 64, but they should have stopped making it.\""]
["03:16,340","03:19,220","\"If you saw it to any Mario Party fans.\""]
["03:19,220","03:23,340","\"Again, this is just how I feel you guys. It's not fact for everybody\""]
["03:23,340","03:28,400","\"It's just me no you're trying to say this is an objective fact that makes you a fucking asshole actually\""]
["03:28,400","03:30,660","\"Well, now that you say it like that. I guess I am\""]
["03:30,660","03:34,020","\"Yeah, see at least we can agree on that\""]
["03:34,020","03:43,180","\"Mario Kart Chris, how about enjoyment from that don't be from that I like crash team racing because I can play it with a friend and\""]
["03:43,180","03:48,080","\"There is actually still some skill to it. They're skilled to using certain items\""]
["03:48,080","03:54,040","\"We used to turn off like the bullshit items, but we would keep on the bombs and the TNT and the nitros and that would be fun\""]
["03:54,040","03:55,700","\"but\""]
["03:55,700","04:01,280","\"Games like Mario Kart it really does just feel like it's bullshit and just anything can it's it feels like Mario Kart\""]
["04:01,280","04:02,340","\"But on a racetrack to me\""]
["04:02,340","04:04,800","\"I mean it feels like Mario Party, but on a racetrack my bed\""]
["04:04,800","04:10,360","\"Well, yeah, cuz it's got that like rubber banding thing where like the last place person gets crazy items\""]
["04:10,360","04:13,040","\"You know what I never understood about Mario Kart?\""]
["04:13,040","04:20,680","\"I never understood the blue shell because the person in last place gets it, but they don't benefit from that at all\""]
["04:20,680","04:24,320","\"It's literally just fucking with the person in first\""]
["04:24,320","04:31,420","\"Yeah, the person last place should get like a boost that like gets you to catch up with like the next person or something\""]
["04:31,420","04:38,400","\"Well, I think okay, here's the thing, but then if you're in fourth place you're benefiting from the person who's in last place\""]
["04:38,640","04:45,320","\"You're sorry. I mean it's an interesting item. It's just not like it's not one that helps the person that gets it\""]
["04:45,320","04:48,280","\"It's really strange. Okay, let's do a batting\""]
["04:48,280","04:56,200","\"A little bit of baseball to earn some quick cash, but yeah, I don't know like I feel like ever since the the we\""]
["04:56,200","05:03,920","\"A lot of Nintendo stuff is just like really not resonated with me and split soon is definitely one of those things where I just look at it\""]
["05:03,920","05:06,280","\"And I go like no part of me\""]
["05:06,840","05:12,740","\"Wild look to the camera ever since I became a grown man who had to pay taxes. I don't want to play games for seven year olds\""]
["05:12,740","05:14,760","\"Basically, yeah\""]
["05:14,760","05:16,760","\"No pretty much. Yeah\""]
["05:16,760","05:21,520","\"No, I don't know like I like I like games with like good stories or\""]
["05:21,520","05:26,340","\"Fucking like I like shit that feels like very I don't know\""]
["05:26,340","05:33,440","\"Immersive like around 2006 I played like elder scrolls oblivion and I was like man\""]
["05:33,440","05:36,220","\"This is what games should be\""]
["05:36,220","05:38,220","\"And\""]
["05:38,220","05:40,720","\"I think that game sucks, but I really like it\""]
["05:40,720","05:46,680","\"I like it too. I feel like it's so full of soul, but it's so\""]
["05:46,680","05:53,760","\"Discussingly awful. Yeah, it's like it's crap, but I it's good crap. I like I'm sorry. That's mean\""]
["05:53,760","05:57,840","\"Also, I don't think Nintendo games are for children. It's what I mostly play but no\""]
["05:57,840","06:05,860","\"I just like the thing the stuff that I get out of games like a lot of Nintendo games just do not fulfill like I\""]
["06:05,860","06:13,560","\"I don't know how else to put that you're saying you want to play the rat killing quest and FF7 remake yes no no not at all\""]
["06:13,560","06:16,240","\"Not that\""]
["06:16,240","06:24,600","\"Because the thing about here's the thing about like like oblivion at least and and to a lesser extent like other Bethesda stuff that they've released since then\""]
["06:24,600","06:29,140","\"Is like yeah like every game is gonna recycle content\""]
["06:29,140","06:34,640","\"But as I was running through the cave and killing my 47 millionth goblin\""]
["06:34,640","06:38,840","\"I felt like I knew story wise why I was doing that.\""]
["06:38,840","06:40,960","\"There was always like a guy who's like,\""]
["06:40,960","06:44,800","\"my wife is missing and she's a vampire also.\""]
["06:44,800","06:46,640","\"And also there's this.\""]
["06:46,640","06:48,120","\"And I always kind of thought like,\""]
["06:48,120","06:50,580","\"oh, this is gonna unfold and like,\""]
["06:50,580","06:52,840","\"there's gonna be like something different.\""]
["06:52,840","06:54,440","\"There's gonna be a story implication\""]
["06:54,440","06:56,560","\"at the end of this goblin cave.\""]
["06:56,560","06:58,080","\"And then there was.\""]
["06:58,080","07:00,480","\"So it's just like, I don't know, things like that\""]
["07:00,480","07:01,440","\"get me into games.\""]
["07:01,440","07:04,560","\"Like I know Chris hugely disagrees.\""]
["07:04,560","07:08,000","\"But I really love games like the new God of War and shit like that.\""]
["07:08,000","07:10,720","\"I'm sorry, Lyle. I despise shit like that.\""]
["07:10,720","07:13,460","\"Yeah, see, I don't like, look, we all have different tastes.\""]
["07:13,460","07:21,480","\"But like at this point, if a game isn't doing something that is so radically different from like anything else that I've played,\""]
["07:21,480","07:25,880","\"that's really the only thing it's got going for it is like story, you know?\""]
["07:25,880","07:31,480","\"So if it can give me a good story, it can kind of, you know, it doesn't have to reinvent the wheel.\""]
["07:31,480","07:37,680","\"Otherwise like I don't care about playing Mario Kart because I played other Mario Kart's\""]
["07:37,680","07:44,820","\"Yeah, I'm just done with it forever. You know what I mean? I like your I like really arcadey crazy things. Mmm\""]
["07:44,820","07:46,360","\"Yeah, definitely\""]
["07:46,360","07:49,540","\"No, I and I miss I feel like there's not as many arcade games now\""]
["07:49,540","07:54,780","\"I feel like I could go for many many more of those and I love movement heavy games where you're just zipping around\""]
["07:54,780","07:57,080","\"Yeah, that's fun\""]
["07:57,080","08:03,240","\"That's why I felt like I oh man. I feel like I tried spider-man on ps4 and I just wasn't really happy\""]
["08:03,240","08:05,900","\"That game's movement is boring because there's nothing to it\""]
["08:05,900","08:10,240","\"It's just like a sassen's creed you did does everything for you when it's ass is great is brand-new\""]
["08:10,240","08:14,240","\"I thought it's pretty cool. You could unlock more boobs and a good no shut up\""]
["08:14,240","08:19,600","\"I've seen it all it doesn't make it any more fun. Sorry that you like holding up fuck\""]
["08:19,600","08:21,760","\"you\""]
["08:21,760","08:25,640","\"I definitely don't think it's as good as like spider-man - no it's too\""]
["08:26,080","08:31,600","\"It's broken and it feels I mean it looks like shit, but you're doing so much more and it's way more fun because of it\""]
["08:31,600","08:38,400","\"Yeah, I think the ps4 one is like okay, but it's not as I wouldn't I wouldn't I\""]
["08:38,400","08:44,240","\"Don't even want to defend it because I like I just think it's okay. It's like the world's okay\""]
["08:44,240","08:49,120","\"Yes game. I only played spider-man one on ps2 and guess what I think it's fucking bullshit\""]
["08:49,840","08:54,900","\"They're getting kind of blows but you could put cheat codes into it and give guys big heads and throw them off buildings and shit\""]
["08:54,900","08:57,560","\"Oh, that's one of the best parts of Tony Hawk on PS2\""]
["08:57,560","09:00,060","\"Giving them a small head. Yeah\""]
["09:00,060","09:06,160","\"In the tricks I love giving them a small head of custom stages and Tony off is so fun\""]
["09:06,160","09:11,400","\"So I'll just make custom stages. We're just a deep pit of lava where I use all create points on that and\""]
["09:11,400","09:15,640","\"Just make them grind into it. Oh dude. I used to love fucking like Tony Hawk\""]
["09:16,120","09:18,120","\"- Ground and shit where you could\""]
["09:18,120","09:18,960","\"- To where?\""]
["09:18,960","09:20,800","\"- You could fucking customize your moves.\""]
["09:20,800","09:23,560","\"And I had this move where my guy like takes out a guitar\""]
["09:23,560","09:28,000","\"and flips like nine million times and a half a second.\""]
["09:28,000","09:29,400","\"It was really awesome.\""]
["09:29,400","09:30,560","\"- That's sick.\""]
["09:30,560","09:32,120","\"- She has no nipples.\""]
["09:32,120","09:32,960","\"- You don't know that.\""]
["09:32,960","09:33,800","\"You don't know that.\""]
["09:33,800","09:34,760","\"We still have hope.\""]
["09:34,760","09:35,600","\"- She's hiding out.\""]
["09:35,600","09:37,880","\"- Yeah, you're nipples, baby.\""]
["09:37,880","09:39,720","\"- I can hear that you're naked.\""]
["09:39,720","09:41,080","\"I can hear your lack of nipples.\""]
["09:41,080","09:41,920","\"- Explain.\""]
["09:41,920","09:45,640","\"I'll show you Travis if you are, go kill for me.\""]
["09:45,640","09:48,240","\"Yes, my baby.\""]
["09:48,240","09:50,040","\"He's Tim Allen.\""]
["09:50,040","09:54,880","\"I mean, Tim Allen.\""]
["09:54,880","09:56,380","\"Tim Allen.\""]
["09:56,380","09:58,240","\"Would you have sex with Tim Allen?\""]
["09:58,240","10:00,280","\"Who is Tim Allen?\""]
["10:00,280","10:04,240","\"Who's the man behind Tim Allen?\""]
["10:04,240","10:06,800","\"He's the guy who's not Buzz Lightyear, right?\""]
["10:06,800","10:08,800","\"He's the guy who was Buzz Lightyear.\""]
["10:08,800","10:10,800","\"He'd have sex with Buzz Lightyear.\""]
["10:10,800","10:11,800","\"And had sex with him.\""]
["10:11,800","10:15,480","\"Until Chris Evern's creeber and made him not him anymore\""]
["10:15,480","10:24,440","\"Okay, I'm so fucking happy. Let your bomb. I'm so happy that gives I don't know why these my tummy big warm feeling\""]
["10:24,440","10:28,440","\"It's such a weird why yeah, I don't know why they go for that either\""]
["10:28,440","10:36,200","\"Get fucked pics. Are you totally deserve it? I think trying to turn still like toy story into a huge franchise as a shit move\""]
["10:36,200","10:40,120","\"That being said though. I did enjoy the buzz let your cartoon as a kid\""]
["10:40,120","10:43,800","\"Yeah, you know, it's great. You know, it's fucking amazing at the start of Toy Story 2.\""]
["10:43,800","10:48,940","\"They nailed the feeling of a Buzz Lightyear movie. Yeah, they could have made a whole movie like that\""]
["10:48,940","10:55,560","\"except they decided to make it all boring and serious and make a stupid cute cat in it. You fucking idiots!\""]
["10:55,560","10:57,880","\"They want to make it look like massive factor fucking...\""]
["10:57,880","10:59,080","\"Oh, it's Pixar!\""]

["23:54,040","23:56,600","\"We did have to do a lot of poetry and I don't remember it\""]
["23:56,600","24:02,400","\"I don't know if I'd say half but it was it was like it was a lot. It was a disproportionate amount\""]
["24:02,400","24:09,780","\"Yeah, we had to do a bunch of poetry such a useless skill in the realms of life that the amount of time that we dedicated to it\""]
["24:09,780","24:13,620","\"Actually makes me fucking unmitigatedly angry.\""]
["24:13,620","24:14,820","\"- Nah, me too.\""]
["24:14,820","24:17,340","\"- Yeah, the worst thing about high school is you are just\""]
["24:17,340","24:19,420","\"old enough to be too sentient and you're just like\""]
["24:19,420","24:21,820","\"sitting there knowing how much of a waste of time it is.\""]
["24:21,820","24:23,540","\"- Yeah, there are a lot of high schoolers\""]
["24:23,540","24:25,100","\"who are gonna get insane rush of dope.\""]
["24:25,100","24:25,940","\"I mean, you're in that.\""]
["24:25,940","24:28,940","\"- But the important thing about school that no one\""]
["24:28,940","24:31,060","\"really mentions is that without it,\""]
["24:31,060","24:32,740","\"you become a social.\""]
["24:32,740","24:33,820","\"- That's kind of true.\""]
["24:33,820","24:37,300","\"- You know, like honestly, the kids that fuck around\""]
["24:37,300","24:43,620","\"class and like throw spitballs and like get suspended probably get infinitely more like\""]
["24:43,620","24:48,100","\"applicable life skills out of high school than the people that like study and like get\""]
["24:48,100","24:49,820","\"As on their tests and shit.\""]
["24:49,820","24:51,940","\"That's the weird sad truth about it.\""]
["24:51,940","24:52,940","\"It's very strange.\""]
["24:52,940","24:55,940","\"Oh, I don't know if I'd agree with that.\""]
["24:55,940","25:00,820","\"I think most of those guys are well maybe that's maybe the case.\""]
["25:00,820","25:03,980","\"It is important though that you surround it with other people so you're not just constantly\""]
["25:03,980","25:05,700","\"learning how to be a dumbass.\""]
["25:05,700","25:06,980","\"That's what the internet's doing.\""]
["25:06,980","25:08,960","\"It teaches you how to be stupid.\""]
["25:08,960","25:10,940","\"I think you find other like-minded stupid people\""]
["25:10,940","25:12,040","\"that even then encourage it.\""]
["25:12,040","25:14,920","\"- That's what I was gonna say is you can be like\""]
["25:14,920","25:17,880","\"really, really socially maladjusted\""]
["25:17,880","25:20,680","\"and go on the internet and find a thousand people\""]
["25:20,680","25:23,840","\"who are exactly similarly socially maladjusted\""]
["25:23,840","25:26,840","\"and get like a sense of normalcy, which is comforting,\""]
["25:26,840","25:28,680","\"but it's not helpful.\""]
["25:28,680","25:32,080","\"Like, it doesn't make you any less like weird\""]
["25:32,080","25:33,920","\"around other people.\""]
["25:33,920","25:35,920","\"There's that one green text where it's like,\""]

["25:39,400","25:42,920","\"People tell me I'm, stop wanting to do that and grow up.\""]
["25:42,920","25:45,120","\"Or wanna fuck a toaster, go online,\""]
["25:45,120","25:47,280","\"find community of like-minded toaster fuckers,\""]

["25:51,520","25:52,920","\"- Damn, that's it, that's it!\""]
["25:52,920","25:55,240","\"- Man, that actually makes a ton of damage, what the fuck?\""]
["25:55,240","25:57,600","\"- It gives you one square of damage.\""]
["25:57,600","26:00,160","\"- No, I had extra purple health before that.\""]
["26:00,160","26:01,480","\"- Purple flirt?\""]
["26:01,480","26:03,000","\"- Yeah.\""]
["26:03,000","26:04,000","\"This is hard.\""]
["26:04,000","26:07,560","\"- Why would you suggest yourself to this?\""]
["26:07,560","26:10,000","\"- You've gotta defeat this wench quickly\""]
["26:10,000","26:11,240","\"so that we can eat.\""]
["26:11,240","26:13,600","\"- I would love to eat.\""]
["26:13,600","26:15,880","\"- See, that's gonna be the Zenkai boost he needs.\""]
["26:15,880","26:17,000","\"He's gonna say like,\""]
["26:17,000","26:19,160","\"\"\"I gotta get that grub!\"\"\""]

["26:21,600","26:22,600","\"- I gotta eat it.\""]
["26:22,600","26:24,740","\"- I feel like there either is\""]
["26:24,740","26:27,400","\"or should be a lot of fan art of this character.\""]
["26:27,400","26:32,520","\"Like she's got a cool design.\""]
["26:32,520","26:39,420","\"She's relatively like shinobu shinobu mm-hmm like made that up no that's that no like shinobu\""]
["26:39,420","26:45,020","\"Yeah, oh my god. She's fucking you if you guys were like in your mid-twenties. Would you kill a high school?\""]
["26:45,020","26:52,320","\"No, that's weird see that's the thing right when you're in high school the guy that kills a high school or in his mid-twenties seems like super cool\""]
["26:52,320","26:55,580","\"And then you get older and you realize that guy's a loser\""]
["26:55,580","26:58,680","\"America's weird\""]
["26:59,160","27:01,520","\"Man, you know what that just reminded me of what's that?\""]
["27:01,520","27:07,900","\"You know one punch man season one's really good. Yeah, and everyone says one punch man season two sucks because of the animation\""]
["27:07,900","27:13,160","\"I think it extra sucks because the sound design is so horrible in the second season\""]
["27:13,160","27:17,320","\"They do that machine gun effects so often it's like the most distracting thing in the world\""]
["27:17,320","27:21,400","\"Whenever there's like a fight people will like punch each other and it'll be like\""]
["27:21,400","27:26,680","\"It's like it's so fucking annoying and bad how they do it\""]
["27:27,200","27:33,660","\"They just repeat the same sound effect over and over to the exact same tempo to the same pitch with like no effects or anything\""]
["27:33,660","27:38,440","\"I will say for some reason sound design has gotten really really bad in animated shows\""]
["27:38,440","27:44,000","\"Lately, it's because you don't need any experience to get hired. They're just like oh, you know how to use that software\""]
["27:44,000","27:46,200","\"Okay, like I remember I was watching like\""]
["27:46,200","27:49,200","\"The the Netflix castle Vania\""]
["27:49,200","27:49,800","\"Yeah\""]
["27:49,800","27:56,900","\"And they have like the same sound effect for like his chain whip and they played it like 20 times back to back to back\""]
["27:56,900","28:02,900","\"it back it's like dude get like 10 of these and like alternate them yeah or just like lower or\""]
["28:02,900","28:08,900","\"heighten the pitch each time yeah even the volume if you do a sound effect two times in a row and\""]
["28:08,900","28:13,860","\"you like fuck with the volume it can even sound different how can your only job be sound design\""]
["28:13,860","28:18,180","\"and you still suck at it it's like the easiest thing to get good at you know what I think the actual\""]
["28:18,180","28:23,460","\"uh the actual answer to that is I think it's because it's like the last thing in the chain maybe if\""]
["28:23,460","28:29,740","\"Like if the episode just has to be done and has to go out that will be the thing that's like left unfinished or they get rushed\""]
["28:29,740","28:34,880","\"Yeah, that's what I mean. I think sound design still just an underappreciated art that most people don't understand\""]
["28:34,880","28:41,540","\"I think we're lucky shit that Dragon Ball Z has such iconic sounds. Yeah a lot of those sounds are just like crazy synth magic\""]
["28:41,540","28:47,360","\"Is there health around anywhere? Did you blow that already? I blew it. So if I get hit on fog\""]
["28:47,360","28:49,900","\"Well, then just don't get hit\""]
["28:50,780","28:52,780","\"That's the plan buddy\""]
