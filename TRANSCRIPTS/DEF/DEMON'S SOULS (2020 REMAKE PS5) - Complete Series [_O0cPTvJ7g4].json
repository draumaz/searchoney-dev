["00:50,760","00:51,760","\"It's already shit.\""]
["00:52,760","00:57,260","\"I thought Dark Souls and Demon Souls really tended toward realism.\""]
["00:57,260","00:59,620","\"This feels very stylized.\""]
["00:59,620","01:01,620","\"Like an unreal game.\""]

["03:26,600","03:29,280","\"Make him a fucking toe head\""]
["03:29,280","03:37,840","\"You're a toe head. It's a term for like on like a white-headed blonde person. Oh really? I think so\""]
["03:37,840","03:41,280","\"Yeah, I kind of like making him all red though. Don't you yeah\""]

["04:11,320","04:13,720","\"Should give him a cool scar he's got some scars\""]

["04:21,640","04:24,640","\"Boredom\""]
["04:24,640","04:31,080","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah now there's an actual game to play we like to play journey to the Nexus\""]
["04:31,280","04:38,400","\"Yeah, I suppose I would so the backstory is there's demons and they're taking over the land with a white fog and\""]
["04:38,400","04:40,960","\"We have come to stop it\""]
["04:40,960","04:44,860","\"Is that the explanation of the white fog doors yes\""]

["05:00,100","05:04,640","\"If you were an expectant mother and this guy just walked out of you indifferently\""]
["05:04,640","05:07,820","\"He's a harlequin\""]
["05:07,820","05:08,680","\"Just\""]
["05:08,680","05:10,680","\"Passionately walks right out\""]
["05:10,680","05:13,780","\"Hey\""]
["05:13,780","05:15,780","\"This is the ps5, huh?\""]
["05:15,780","05:23,100","\"The one only and true I want to see you really use that club is it just me or is the recording look different?\""]
["05:23,100","05:25,600","\"He looks really red in the recording look at that\""]
["05:25,600","05:29,620","\"Yeah, he looks way redder in the recording whatever it is we can deal with it for now\""]
["05:29,620","05:39,100","\"Look another guy is that a real man. Yeah, I was a man here. That's a man in another dimension\""]
["05:39,100","05:45,180","\"Look at me go look at me go. I'm a little red guy. Wow. We in a big demon souls world\""]
["05:45,180","05:50,180","\"What do you think of the graphics holy crap? I think you go good\""]
["05:50,180","05:53,820","\"Shut up\""]
["05:53,820","05:57,220","\"Don't hurt me\""]
["05:57,300","06:01,320","\"Let's try to like blast through this whole part. So does that does look real slick?\""]
["06:01,320","06:07,940","\"Does this play the same as the other one or is this like smoother? Oh, it seems smoother. I mean, I don't really know\""]
["06:07,940","06:15,540","\"Like it I haven't played the other one in the wall. It definitely looks like it animates a little differently not in a bad way\""]
["06:15,540","06:20,840","\"But I I don't know if like the exact frame data would be used, you know what I mean?\""]
["06:20,840","06:26,740","\"I read somewhere that they pretty much use the exact same code. So I have no idea. Maybe that's fake\""]
["06:26,740","06:31,420","\"Yeah, they probably if this was a port or remastered, I'm sure they had the original source code\""]
["06:31,420","06:37,700","\"Well, we were actually just talking about this in another recording, but it was a remaster of a PS3 game\""]
["06:37,700","06:43,780","\"It is a PS3 game that is a good one. We had like a bunch of weird architecture and that's why a lot of the ports are weird\""]
["06:43,780","06:46,780","\"But it used the same engine as dark\""]
["06:46,780","06:53,340","\"And I'm sure it's still mostly written in C++ regardless of the architecture. Yeah, that's true\""]
["06:53,340","06:55,340","\"I\""]
["06:55,340","07:01,340","\"I think blue point specifically is one of the few studios that's somehow able to like unravel that\""]
["07:01,340","07:05,680","\"Because they did the remaster of the Uncharted games and they play exactly identical\""]
["07:05,680","07:11,820","\"They did the remaster of the Uncharted's? Yeah, I didn't know that. I thought they just did the shadow of the colossal\""]
["07:11,820","07:19,100","\"Yeah, they did that too. Mmm. Your childhood remastered just bring it to them and your parents will be good to you this time\""]
["07:19,100","07:24,100","\"They made the environments look good, but they sure did fuck up the designs of everything\""]
["07:24,100","07:31,960","\"I mean as somebody who doesn't have a lot of skin in the game because I didn't really play much of the original\""]
["07:31,960","07:37,400","\"I think it looks fine, but that's that's just me not really not really knowing better\""]
["07:37,400","07:42,640","\"It definitely feels a lot brighter than its predecessor\""]
["07:42,640","07:50,040","\"Hmm probably is like I get that they're showing off a lot of the new lighting engine too, but like\""]
["07:51,600","08:00,600","\"Did you play the original? Yeah, I played it too, but my cousin gave it to me almost is like a fuck you like not mean\""]
["08:00,600","08:05,720","\"But like dude isn't it funny like this game just fucks you up, and I was like yeah, that's cool\""]
["08:05,720","08:09,600","\"But it's not fun. Oh, I think this is a very fun game\""]
["08:09,600","08:11,280","\"It's just a personal taste thing\""]
["08:11,280","08:20,240","\"But Sekiro is almost like it gets rid of every single thing that I find like kind of annoying or like unnecessarily esoteric about Dark Souls\""]
["08:20,440","08:25,280","\"I'm not saying that I'm right. Well, I am but you don't have to agree with me\""]
["08:25,280","08:30,880","\"But clearly somebody at from soft does this guy's more careful than his brother. Come on\""]
["08:30,880","08:33,920","\"How do you know they're related he's blue?\""]
["08:33,920","08:37,260","\"So they're all related my god fuck this guy\""]
["08:37,260","08:40,280","\"Fucking that'll learn you oh\""]
["08:40,280","08:48,000","\"My god, that was very cheeky of you. Did you not see him? I did I just I thought I had time look at that\""]
["08:48,000","08:50,000","\"Have you ever seen such physics?\""]
["08:50,000","08:52,680","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:52,680","08:54,920","\"- Dang, it's got like actual mass.\""]
["08:54,920","08:55,760","\"- I know.\""]
["08:55,760","08:58,680","\"It's like going to actual mass.\""]
["08:58,680","09:01,680","\"Another thing about this is I was very much a fan\""]
["09:01,680","09:05,480","\"of the original music and this game turned all of it\""]
["09:05,480","09:08,440","\"into generic Hollywood shit.\""]
["09:08,440","09:10,600","\"Is it like remixes of the same songs\""]
["09:10,600","09:11,520","\"or is it just completely different?\""]
["09:11,520","09:12,360","\"- Something like different.\""]
["09:12,360","09:13,200","\"- It's completely different.\""]
["09:13,200","09:14,040","\"- It's completely different.\""]
["09:14,040","09:15,280","\"Like, I don't know.\""]
["09:15,280","09:17,240","\"It just seems like they went for the most generic thing\""]
["09:17,240","09:19,160","\"that could have possibly done and just,\""]
["09:19,160","09:20,360","\"The fuck up thing was everyone's like,\""]
["09:20,360","09:22,680","\"the old music was shitty midi, and it's like, no,\""]
["09:22,680","09:24,880","\"it was an orchestra, they just had less instruments\""]
["09:24,880","09:25,920","\"and it sounded good.\""]
["09:25,920","09:30,080","\"And it, it's the brass was up really close\""]
["09:30,080","09:31,800","\"to the microphone, so it sounded all like,\""]
["09:31,800","09:32,720","\"(imitates brass)\""]
["09:32,720","09:33,800","\"but I thought it was cool.\""]
["09:33,800","09:36,000","\"I thought it suited it because like,\""]
["09:36,000","09:38,240","\"in all like medieval shit,\""]
["09:38,240","09:40,000","\"that's the kind of brass you'd usually see\""]
["09:40,000","09:43,160","\"like being played around the time and shit.\""]
["09:43,160","09:46,080","\"Yeah, I feel like there's certain things where\""]
["09:47,160","09:52,160","\"People have gotten so used to hearing them mixed and recorded\""]
["09:52,160","09:56,960","\"that they kind of forget what they actually sound like.\""]
["09:56,960","10:01,040","\"My big thing, and I don't know if any audio engineers\""]
["10:01,040","10:03,900","\"actually agree with this, is on a drum kit.\""]
["10:03,900","10:06,400","\"When you hit the crash, that is the loudest\""]
["10:06,400","10:08,480","\"fucking thing on the drum kit.\""]
["10:08,480","10:11,320","\"But anytime drums are in music,\""]
["10:11,320","10:14,240","\"it's always about the kick and the snare.\""]
["10:14,240","10:19,320","\"So the crash is always like this like little like in the background and I hate that\""]
["10:19,320","10:24,760","\"Are you big brute this thing looks stupid? He's got nipples\""]
["10:24,760","10:32,520","\"He's got long nipples. Look at that shit. Why would you add that? I like how when you smack his ass at jiggles\""]
["10:32,520","10:37,080","\"I never noticed that I actually like that. Oh\""]
["10:37,080","10:42,920","\"Can I pick this man's little butt dingle\""]
["10:42,920","10:50,900","\"I'm actually amazed at that. I never even noticed that is this uh are you supposed to beat him or is he like the\""]
["10:50,900","10:57,000","\"Is he like the asylum demon where you're supposed to just no fuck run past him just you're kidding it\""]
["10:57,000","11:00,480","\"You're supposed to be able to fucking stop hurting. No I\""]
["11:00,480","11:03,760","\"Love smacking this things fat ass\""]
["11:03,760","11:10,480","\"It's oddly satisfying and like a way that oh what I'd rather not work out right now\""]
["11:10,800","11:16,520","\"One thing I don't understand is why they wouldn't give you an option to have the original music. It's like the easiest thing to implement\""]
["11:16,520","11:19,240","\"And then you're not upsetting anybody\""]
["11:19,240","11:24,000","\"Is that what art is truly about Chris not upsetting anybody?\""]
["11:24,000","11:28,760","\"I mean you shouldn't be overwriting something that someone else's vision and\""]
["11:28,760","11:34,800","\"Rooning it. I don't know. It's fine. Do a newcomer. I guess. Oh, yeah, you won't notice\""]
["11:36,840","11:41,300","\"But for the people who really love the original like your boy Chrissy\""]
["11:41,300","11:46,680","\"Just think it's kind of I don't think those are even necessarily niffers. Oh\""]
["11:46,680","11:52,640","\"You die I really wanted to see this however the Nexus traps you well at least\""]
["11:52,640","11:56,780","\"That is how you are slapped\""]
["12:03,240","12:05,240","\"It's a place for you to be.\""]
["12:05,240","12:07,240","\"So, look at my in-kit lady.\""]
["12:07,240","12:08,240","\"You remember all that, Tomar?\""]
["12:08,240","12:09,240","\"What?\""]
["12:09,240","12:12,240","\"That strength be granted so the world might be manded.\""]
["12:12,240","12:13,240","\"That's what she says.\""]
["12:13,240","12:15,240","\"Oh, there's the world's biggest sword right there.\""]
["12:15,240","12:17,240","\"I'm so fucking pissed that that killed me.\""]
["12:17,240","12:20,240","\"It slapped your tuckus.\""]
["12:20,240","12:22,240","\"It's your boy.\""]
["12:22,240","12:25,240","\"Wow, you look ridiculous.\""]
["12:25,240","12:27,240","\"No.\""]
["12:27,240","12:29,240","\"I look cool.\""]
["12:29,240","12:32,240","\"I'm not sure if you have the past or not.\""]
["12:32,240","12:40,400","\"You're not exactly white, but I don't think you are either actually I think you're faking\""]
["12:40,400","12:46,420","\"I know you used to be white you're saying that he dole is all\""]
["12:46,420","12:49,000","\"He turning to stone\""]
["12:49,000","12:51,760","\"No, what's that in his arm his right arm?\""]
["12:51,760","12:54,760","\"It's got skates\""]
["12:54,760","12:57,400","\"Yeah, it does look like he's got scales\""]
["12:58,120","13:05,760","\"I always thought it was a thing because he's like a my or a blacksmith and he was down in that one place where everyone has scales like that. Oh\""]
["13:05,760","13:11,920","\"So he's like half of something. I just thought it was just the effect of working in that specific place for so long\""]
["13:11,920","13:13,920","\"It might be maybe I'm wrong\""]
["13:13,920","13:19,240","\"That is one thing that's cool about these games is a lot of the story isn't really told to you other than\""]
["13:19,240","13:26,480","\"Through visual cues and environments. Yeah, I think that that's something that video games do\""]

["01:05:57,820","01:06:01,420","\"It just kind of loses the appeal after a while. That's true\""]
["01:06:01,420","01:06:04,740","\"That's what this entire remake is gonna feel like\""]
["01:06:04,740","01:06:10,960","\"I'm gonna try to stop bitching about it. I can understand what people think the demons sold original soundtrack is shit. I\""]
["01:06:10,960","01:06:13,640","\"Get it\""]
["01:06:13,640","01:06:14,640","\"What to me?\""]
["01:06:14,640","01:06:16,640","\"Jesus charm\""]
["01:06:16,640","01:06:21,820","\"Yeah, I would I would take something with personality over just something generic any day honestly\""]
["01:06:21,820","01:06:25,220","\"I really do feel like all of the new music is not an improvement at all\""]
["01:06:25,220","01:06:28,420","\"I am curious to see what the tower knight theme is in this game\""]
["01:06:28,420","01:06:34,620","\"And I can recognize roast in a goggle shit, and I do not feel like any of that applies to this\""]
["01:06:34,620","01:06:36,940","\"How's that's how's the tower knight son go? It's like\""]
["01:06:36,940","01:06:44,060","\"Yeah, it's literally that vocalization right bump bump bump bump bump with the B\""]
["01:06:44,060","01:06:47,260","\"Yeah\""]
["01:06:49,740","01:06:53,660","\"Well, like obviously I get a mid like these graphics are wonderful like look at that. It's beautiful\""]
["01:06:53,660","01:07:00,060","\"It's so crazy seeing a game like this running at this kind of frame rate. I know right. This is the future\""]
["01:07:00,060","01:07:04,460","\"We're in the future. I feel like a lot of the animations look really good, too\""]
["01:07:04,460","01:07:07,700","\"Yeah, I'm not sure if they redid stuff. I feel like they did\""]
["01:07:07,700","01:07:13,540","\"Yeah, what would make sense? I really don't think that any Souls game is looked like this\""]
["01:07:13,540","01:07:19,180","\"Man, I was so fucking mad when they said they were remastering Dark Souls one\""]
["01:07:19,180","01:07:23,380","\"This is what I expected like this level because they in the ads they showed\""]
["01:07:23,380","01:07:28,780","\"Like they did a CG trailer and they pretty much just looked like this from the trailer\""]
["01:07:28,780","01:07:34,100","\"And then they just came out with the same graphics with worse lighting and nothing was improved except for textures\""]
["01:07:34,100","01:07:44,060","\"Yeah, I think Dark Souls is a weird one because it's where those wolves jumped through the wall and freaked me out\""]
["01:07:44,060","01:07:45,580","\"Or did they just get rid of that?\""]
["01:07:45,580","01:07:52,660","\"Oh, oh god. Dark Souls is so revered that I feel like they're probably really really scared of touching it\""]
["01:07:52,660","01:07:56,580","\"But everybody only likes the first like two-thirds of that game\""]
["01:07:56,580","01:08:01,920","\"You know what? I would say the Dark Souls remastered over them doing this to it\""]
["01:08:01,920","01:08:06,500","\"Like making the backgrounds look good ruining every single design of the game. That's fair\""]
["01:08:06,500","01:08:12,980","\"But if they if they remastered like fucking what's that boss that everyone hates the tree or whatever? Oh\""]
["01:08:13,260","01:08:17,180","\"The better chaos yeah, if they fix that that would be worth it\""]
["01:08:17,180","01:08:22,660","\"And then the end where they just kind of keep reusing like the tourist demons ass or whatever. Yeah\""]
["01:08:22,660","01:08:25,180","\"God, it sucks\""]
["01:08:25,180","01:08:30,380","\"I feel like you can't really touch anything up to anorwondo\""]
["01:08:30,380","01:08:38,260","\"But after that the game kind of no one would miss anything past there exactly the final or the second half\""]
["01:08:38,260","01:08:45,460","\"Dark Souls one is kind of shit, but it's still it's funnier than most games just not as good as the first half. Yeah, it's fair\""]
["01:08:45,460","01:08:47,860","\"boa\""]
["01:08:47,860","01:08:49,860","\"I think you're good in here\""]
["01:08:49,860","01:08:55,020","\"Think you're good in here go through that little oh, that's a much bigger door now. I\""]
["01:08:55,020","01:08:59,700","\"Remember that being a really tiny little door that barely fits you\""]
["01:08:59,700","01:09:05,500","\"I don't know why I remember these little details was probably because I was just playing the ps3 version. I\""]
["01:09:06,180","01:09:09,180","\"Like that the lighting like see that yeah, that's great\""]
["01:09:09,180","01:09:10,060","\"It's really cool\""]
["01:09:10,060","01:09:15,660","\"Like it's got effects of like the impurities and like the metal of your shield and at least that's how it reads\""]
["01:09:15,660","01:09:17,660","\"Yeah, that's a sick attention\""]
["01:09:17,660","01:09:25,340","\"That's the biggest graphic I've ever seen\""]
["01:09:25,340","01:09:33,580","\"Look at this guy what a silly cool you got his pickaxe\""]
["01:09:33,980","01:09:36,080","\"I'm gonna pick my ass tonight when you guys leave\""]
["01:09:36,080","01:09:42,340","\"You get his pick ass see that like you haven't been digging for gold this whole this whole channel\""]
["01:09:42,340","01:09:45,640","\"You'd be careful trying to cross that bridge\""]
["01:09:45,640","01:09:48,700","\"This one you and I both know what hat\""]
["01:09:48,700","01:09:55,300","\"Why is this guy like it gets replaced with like like there is something that doesn't fall, but I would ah\""]
["01:09:55,300","01:09:57,760","\"I was trying to see if I could roll it\""]
["01:10:00,860","01:10:30,840","\"I love how they fall over in this version. It's Ed sharpening stone. Oh, that's blacksmith adds. I don't know why you dropped it here. I'm making a ruckus.

["01:10:30,840","01:10:34,120","\"until I've beaten the Wetser face doll.\""]
