["03:18,120","03:23,960","\"I feel like the other characters even Dante. He looks like a rabid like homeless man\""]
["03:23,960","03:26,720","\"I mean, it makes it looks. Yeah, it makes sense. Whoa\""]

["03:38,700","03:43,420","\"I mean, I see like non-canon now everybody who made it said that they hate it pretty much actually non-canon all right\""]
["03:43,420","03:45,420","\"So I played\""]
["03:45,420","03:51,260","\"Devil May Cry 2 right after playing three and I'm like everyone says this game is bad. It is bad\""]
["03:51,260","03:55,300","\"I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna prefix that before I fucking get into the the top\""]
["03:55,300","03:58,900","\"I just want to say that the morning the morning it was morning time of course\""]

["04:09,300","04:16,660","\"I don't have a player now, but I played it and it is bad.\""]
["04:16,660","04:22,780","\"But the thing is that's insane about the game is they didn't properly code any actual\""]
["04:22,780","04:23,780","\"attacks.\""]
["04:23,780","04:28,000","\"Like Dave knows the whole story where like they only had like the thrust move, your\""]
["04:28,000","04:29,980","\"stinger and that's all they had.\""]
["04:29,980","04:34,780","\"And in the game you only have like three fucking attacks, but when you pull out your\""]
["04:34,780","04:40,940","\"gun and you're in devil trigger mode you're like we're unloading so many bullets that enemies\""]
["04:40,940","04:44,700","\"are vaporizing before your eyes you go into a room with a boss and you just\""]
["04:44,700","04:50,140","\"and they're dead in literally seconds i want to clarify that sound effects why i'm laughing\""]
["04:50,140","04:55,980","\"it's funny because like every boss like this boss comes in it has like the worst cutscene ever\""]
["04:55,980","05:01,020","\"it just sort of phases in and you just pop it in two seconds i was dead and you don't actually\""]
["05:01,020","05:07,060","\"Level up any devil trigger all you do is purchase devil fruit whatever the fuck it's called who's this talking now?\""]
["05:07,060","05:12,740","\"Devil gems. He's like the shadow person that the hot topic guy owns. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so\""]
["05:12,740","05:19,640","\"The worst part I want to say this because it made me fucking just beyond angry\""]
["05:19,640","05:23,100","\"I've never been so mad at a game besides Mario maker and\""]
["05:24,340","05:30,780","\"But there's a part where in anyone who's played it on a even if you're playing ironically\""]
["05:30,780","05:35,700","\"You're just laughing along with it you get to this fucking part where you have to fight a zombie helicopter and zombie tank\""]
["05:35,700","05:37,460","\"That's all I want to tell yourself\""]
["05:37,460","05:42,260","\"It is so fucking impossibly hard and long and stupid and boring so we at this part\""]
["05:42,260","05:45,100","\"You have to climb like the Empire State Building pretty much and here\""]
["05:45,100","05:46,740","\"No, I'm not in this\""]
["05:46,740","05:51,500","\"Okay, okay, you can climb all the way to the top and you have to like wall jump up the building and it takes fucking forever\""]
["05:51,500","05:54,340","\"And then the helicopter is at the top horrible and Cory was like\""]
["05:54,340","05:59,100","\"I don't know this game kind of sucks and he got to the top and a missile hit him square in the face the moment his\""]
["05:59,100","06:04,520","\"Feeds tucked to the top and it knocked him like 20 and gave miles off the top of the building and he fucking screamed\""]
["06:04,520","06:10,740","\"I'm gonna say this this this part. This is one of those situations where you can beat the final boss like right away\""]
["06:10,740","06:13,240","\"So Dave loses he stinks\""]
["06:13,240","06:15,240","\"Wait, do you want me to be here right now?\""]
["06:15,240","06:17,240","\"Yes, okay first try\""]

["06:24,800","06:28,760","\"Also that weird throat throne demon has a lot of potential\""]
["06:28,760","06:32,040","\"Not literally doesn't\""]
["06:32,040","06:36,040","\"Cory what do you think of bosses that are just dudes sitting in chairs like\""]
["06:36,040","06:44,360","\"Just wanted Kingdom Hearts was my Final Fantasy 15 and now here. I like how nonchalantly he's tossing like fuck you fireballs\""]
["06:44,360","06:46,360","\"And just not really he's not really\""]
["06:47,560","06:49,760","\"It's pretty neat. I don't know. Yeah, it's really cool\""]
["06:49,760","06:54,880","\"Jeff yeah, hello, why would you say is your favorite?\""]
["06:54,880","07:01,040","\"aesthetic in this screen right now my favorite aesthetic in the screen I\""]
["07:01,040","07:04,240","\"Just like the fact that the guys like face palm and you so bored\""]
["07:04,240","07:15,000","\"Lately love how so disinterested he is is this the first boss you'll sort of kind of oh my god\""]
["07:15,000","07:18,700","\"It's supposed to be like a sequence that you can't beat but Jeff just dared me to beat it\""]
["07:18,700","07:21,200","\"So now I have to this is like I know he's losing\""]
["07:21,200","07:27,460","\"There's a thing about double-mate cry that I would lose that did you ever beat this Jeff? No, you suck\""]
["07:27,460","07:31,520","\"Well, I only play to the game once you've already brown browno\""]
["07:31,520","07:38,120","\"You literally only nicked off like 0.3% of us are gonna kill him as soon as this ends alright, so basically\""]
["07:39,880","07:43,440","\"Devil May Cry, it's the weirdest gaming experience ever.\""]
["07:43,440","07:44,640","\"I can't even explain it.\""]
["07:44,640","07:48,120","\"You just kind of go on autopilot and you just let the game play itself and it's just like\""]

["07:49,120","07:50,440","\"You don't even know what you're doing at the time.\""]

["07:57,040","07:59,520","\"I'm just like, my brain is turned off.\""]
["07:59,520","08:01,600","\"I'm literally like gone.\""]

["08:20,600","08:24,600","\"You said we should play with all the end game powers, so that's all you know.\""]
["08:24,600","08:26,600","\"Yeah, we were not going to do that, and then Jeff forces to do it.\""]
["08:26,600","08:27,600","\"But it's like it take...\""]
["08:27,600","08:29,600","\"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, can't.\""]

["09:10,020","09:11,020","\"I was going to play through it.\""]
["09:11,020","09:12,420","\"But I have the end powers, so you beat him.\""]

["37:23,100","37:26,020","\"Yeah, no, no, no, yeah, it's completely like flawed, but-\""]
["37:26,020","37:27,260","\"It is fun though.\""]
["37:27,260","37:35,020","\"But it feels way more like an actual world than fucking Dark Souls 2 or 3, Dark Souls 3 pretty much just like retreads the book on Demon Souls.\""]

["39:58,740","40:00,660","\"And they repeat the process\""]
