["14:35,400","14:47,400","\"with a nice watch with like a really clean beard. Corey, I think I just did something.\""]
["14:47,400","14:55,200","\"What? Oh, you can. Oh, look at that. See, I told you you could do a little bit. I guess it does\""]
["14:55,200","14:59,880","\"it a little bit. You kind of get a little bit. Yeah, it's a pretty minuscule though. It might\""]
["14:59,880","15:02,520","\"have been the little bit that we needed for that one part. I'm going to watch a speeder of this\""]
["15:02,520","15:07,520","\"game when we're done playing it because I want to be like just in awe with someone really\""]
["15:07,520","15:13,080","\"skilled at it. I feel like this game plays a lot. I'm really skilled. It plays a lot\""]
["15:13,080","15:17,760","\"like Sonic or something but with better like platforming with the understanding of momentum\""]
["15:17,760","15:25,800","\"like even even I can say like you know Sonic definitely momentum kind of a faction but\""]
["15:25,800","15:30,600","\"or kind of a factor but not anywhere as like honest as this like this game's like momentum\""]
["15:30,600","15:34,320","\"is the only way to play this game. Like the whole design of it is just this like loose\""]
["15:34,320","15:38,480","\"flowing like as if you like pulled a booger from your face and made a\""]
["15:38,480","15:43,080","\"line of like spider-weight. I feel like it handles a like\""]
["15:43,080","15:45,920","\"vertical up there like vertical movement.\""]
["15:45,920","15:54,200","\"Sonic does because anytime you have to move vertically in sonic it just feels bad to me. It does a lot of the vertical movement in sonic.\""]
["15:54,200","15:59,320","\"It's not like really only feels good when you're running it. It feels bad if you're trying to control your jumps.\""]
["15:59,640","16:03,260","\"What's this guys probably I wish I could do that in real life, but I feel like my knees would buckle\""]
["16:03,260","16:08,760","\"I remember that jump like the the backflip jump always feeling really good. That's cool\""]
["16:08,760","16:13,940","\"Like popping off the things that freaked you can hit all those Chris. I'm having fun. Just getting\""]
["16:13,940","16:20,620","\"That's satisfying shit. It's kind of annoying to have to constantly beat stuff up\""]
["16:20,620","16:24,640","\"I agree satisfying to like just have a line of enemies where you go do do do do do\""]
["16:24,640","16:30,720","\"You just hit a bunch of people yeah, and then maybe you have to stop and fight a few people like you want to keep the momentum going\""]
["16:30,720","16:35,620","\"I feel like a lot of beat them up games kind of missed the point and like sometimes you just want to feel\""]
["16:35,620","16:40,960","\"Powerful and kill things in one hit and then yeah sure make a choke point where an enemy is slightly stronger\""]
["16:40,960","16:46,200","\"But but I don't mind talking about nightmare cop stuff like if you guys have any questions shit is it gonna be good\""]
["16:46,200","16:51,240","\"Let's help after the development time and spend put into it. I hope it's like this\""]
["16:51,240","16:54,100","\"I hope people play it and they're just in awe as they go around and do shit\""]
["16:54,100","16:58,900","\"That markups pretty good. I played it. Yeah, no, it's fun Tom\""]
["16:58,900","17:02,580","\"If there's anything Tom understands better than like most people is\""]
["17:02,580","17:07,900","\"Game feel like he can make a game feel just like so good because he knows what he wants to play\""]
["17:07,900","17:13,260","\"Tom wants to play like a fun arcade style game that has a really good sense of control\""]
["17:13,260","17:18,360","\"It wasn't 80s Neo Geo kid. He was he was the only kid who had a Neo Geo and he got beat up for it\""]
["17:21,780","17:26,940","\"Came stronger for it dude. It's so satisfying watching you play Chris. I love this game\""]
["17:26,940","17:28,940","\"It just has a good sense of flow\""]
["17:28,940","17:36,500","\"And then you like here's another thing all the placement of these things are like showing you new paths to follow kind of like the rings and Sonic\""]
["17:36,500","17:39,680","\"But I love this kind of like precision platform\""]
["17:39,680","17:45,740","\"I love jumping and shit. Yeah, but it's like fast-paced precision platform. Have you ever played this before Chris?\""]
["17:45,740","17:47,740","\"There's this like your first time\""]
["17:47,740","17:51,520","\"But I feel like this is a really good version of it like I feel like the old one was good\""]
["17:51,520","17:57,440","\"But this is just like like realized also the levels are really massive. They're fun\""]
["17:57,440","18:03,680","\"On the music is still like I'm like I'm doing it. I'm doing it. It's like you feel like you're overcoming a mountain\""]
["18:03,680","18:09,040","\"I just left to right. You don't have to worry about going up or down. Yeah, like if this was a Metroidvania\""]
["18:09,040","18:15,400","\"It'd be like oh, you know, you know another thing I hate in platformers that I really feel like it's an old design thing that just gets old\""]
["18:15,800","18:21,880","\"Is like when you come to a part where you have to scale up and you can fall all the way down and do it all over again\""]
["18:21,880","18:25,800","\"Yeah, I hate that yeah, we were doing a lot of that and Sonic that\""]
["18:25,800","18:33,140","\"The problem with that shit is like yeah, Sonic - I know exactly advanced - oh God\""]
["18:33,140","18:39,220","\"Yeah, the problem with that is like I feel like you could put things like webs that could stop you when you get to a certain\""]
["18:39,220","18:41,220","\"Point where it's like you've gotten it here\""]
["18:41,220","18:45,640","\"You don't have to fall all the way down like put checkpoints by making like a natural checkpoint\""]
["18:45,640","18:49,080","\"And like fuck I don't know if my head on that thing\""]
["18:49,080","18:53,940","\"There's just old things about games that just don't work anymore, and that's one of them. Yeah, I agree\""]
["18:53,940","18:55,940","\"Well, that's satisfying. Oh\""]
["18:55,940","19:04,380","\"That was cool guys take a butt chug every time I say that's satisfying and don't complain if it hurts guys vodka tampon every time\""]
["19:04,380","19:11,240","\"I'm absolutely loving getting the momentum from this like like doing that. Yeah, that's so fun\""]
["19:11,240","19:16,780","\"It is really satisfying to watch guys nose shotgun vodka every time I go whoa\""]
["19:16,780","19:21,540","\"Guys so cool. You're either really sound wrong\""]
["19:21,540","19:24,320","\"- Oh shit, this is so cool. - Oh my god.\""]
