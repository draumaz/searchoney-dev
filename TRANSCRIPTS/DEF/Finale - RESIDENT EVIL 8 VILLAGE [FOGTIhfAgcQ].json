["09:49,780","09:57,940","\"The conclusion is that and was that I felt at the time like I just kind of believed like it made me feel so inadequate as\""]

["10:08,420","10:16,020","\"And it just didn't exist. There's not a compute type of special computer program called a hydra that needs to be like\""]
