["00:06,640","00:08,360","\"You want to look at the additional credits, you guys?\""]
["00:08,360","00:10,840","\"We don't want to eat dessert before we eat dinner.\""]
["00:10,840","00:12,080","\"Come on, man.\""]
["00:12,080","00:12,600","\"[laughing]\""]

["00:14,640","00:15,800","\"OK, we good.\""]
["00:15,800","00:17,640","\"All right.\""]
["00:17,640","00:19,120","\"Yeah, when that Chocobo is running,\""]
["00:19,120","00:21,000","\"don't turn off the game, Telmar.\""]
["00:21,000","00:21,840","\"OK.\""]
["00:21,840","00:24,200","\"Don't run over the computer and kick the computer.\""]
["00:24,200","00:26,040","\"I really wish you'd stop bringing that up.\""]
["00:26,040","00:28,160","\"I really wish you'd stop bringing that up.\""]
["00:28,160","00:30,160","\"Dude, what a story.\""]
["00:30,160","00:35,840","\"When I was a boy, I used to think that you know it was such a babe, and then I became a man,\""]
["00:35,840","00:40,080","\"and then I realized it was all about Lulu, and then I became a jaded and angry man,\""]
["00:40,080","00:45,280","\"and I realized Lulu is the kind of bitch that would probably mix her period in with your spaghetti sauce,\""]
["00:45,280","00:47,360","\"because she thinks it'll make you love her forever.\""]
["00:47,360","00:50,680","\"I think nearly every character in this group is fucked up in a weird way.\""]
["00:50,680","00:51,680","\"You think?\""]
["00:51,680","00:55,240","\"Wok is okay, but he's kind of annoying as hell.\""]
["00:55,240","00:58,420","\"I think everybody is cool except for Tidus.\""]
["00:58,420","00:59,360","\"- Tidus? - Yeah.\""]
["00:59,360","01:00,640","\"- Titus, whatever.\""]
["01:00,640","01:02,640","\"- If I hung out with Yuna for like four days in a row--\""]
["01:02,640","01:04,720","\"- I bring you here, Tidus is the correct way to say it,\""]
["01:04,720","01:07,480","\"but Titus is the way all the normal people have said it.\""]
["01:07,480","01:08,480","\"- Titus sounds cooler.\""]
["01:08,480","01:10,480","\"Well Yuna is kind of a rider die bitch,\""]
["01:10,480","01:12,440","\"but yeah, if you hung out with her for two y'all,\""]
["01:12,440","01:14,320","\"she'd start praying at you and--\""]
["01:14,320","01:16,320","\"- She would drive me fucking ballistic.\""]
["01:16,320","01:19,000","\"- I think Riku would probably drive me nuts.\""]
["01:19,000","01:21,680","\"That'd be the kind of chick that like burns all your clothes\""]
["01:21,680","01:23,880","\"'cause she saw that you were like texting another girl.\""]
["01:23,880","01:24,880","\"- That chick, there's the worst one.\""]
["01:24,880","01:32,400","\"She's annoying at this point. You're supposed to be so excited because it's in 2002 and you just got\""]
["01:32,400","01:38,360","\"The first Final Fantasy game to come out on the PlayStation 2. Oh, you're at you kind of sent me back there\""]
["01:38,360","01:40,200","\"I gave me shivers day in my spine. Oh wow\""]
["01:40,200","01:44,520","\"This has the most obtrusive logo in the background though\""]
["01:44,520","01:50,920","\"You have to admit that anytime I look out at a horizon a big logo comes up and it always makes me angry\""]
["01:50,920","01:56,520","\"Is he gonna say this is our story? He says then the opening silly silly buskets you goose\""]
["01:56,520","02:02,760","\"I'm so sad about that ball now. We get to watch the exact thing. We just saw this is our story\""]
["02:02,760","02:04,760","\"You love that line, don't you?\""]
["02:04,760","02:07,440","\"He's been saying it since we said we're gonna play this game\""]
["02:07,440","02:08,860","\"Maybe our last chance\""]
["02:08,860","02:13,600","\"Omar's been running up and down the hallways and his little booties saying this is our story\""]
["02:13,600","02:16,120","\"And also this may be our last chance\""]
["02:16,120","02:19,120","\"This is the only final fantasy game that I've ever beat\""]
["02:19,120","02:23,820","\"A seven is the only one I ever be and I got to the very end of this game and couldn't get past the boss at the end\""]
["02:23,820","02:26,180","\"I just never played it again. Listen to my story\""]
["02:26,180","02:32,640","\"There it is listen to my story. Yeah, so it wasn't even me. Yeah last chance. Tell me you fucked up\""]
["02:32,640","02:38,600","\"I totally corrected myself. It's in the video. I corrected myself as listen to my story like a minute ago\""]
["02:38,600","02:40,800","\"Okay, okay. All right\""]
["02:40,800","02:46,220","\"You can review the footage. Don't cut it out to make me look dumb. It's listen to my story\""]
["02:46,220","02:48,440","\"Dude put a D at the end of that there\""]
["02:48,440","02:50,200","\"Oh fuck yes.\""]
["02:50,200","02:51,800","\"That makes me little.\""]
["02:51,800","02:52,840","\"Final Fantasy XD\""]
["02:52,840","02:54,520","\"That's what they should have called it.\""]
["02:54,520","02:57,320","\"Final Fantasy Lion Face Edition.\""]
["02:57,320","03:02,600","\"I feel like 2002 was probably one of the like cringiest, weebiest stages in my life.\""]
["03:02,600","03:06,280","\"The future has the worst clothes I've come to see.\""]
["03:06,280","03:08,520","\"And the worst children. Look at that horrible thing.\""]
["03:08,520","03:12,360","\"I actually really like this version of the prelude song.\""]
["03:12,360","03:14,600","\"Dude. That's me.\""]
["03:14,600","03:15,160","\"Wait, what?\""]
["03:15,160","03:17,240","\"I remember this opening part being really cool.\""]
["03:17,240","03:20,040","\"I don't remember that little critter fading into existence.\""]
["03:20,040","03:21,800","\"We'll see how it starts out.\""]
["03:21,800","03:24,140","\"We'll see how well you remember Tomar.\""]
["03:24,140","03:27,040","\"You've been saying a lot of things about this and that other game.\""]
["03:27,040","03:28,940","\"Can you please talk to your biggest fans?\""]
["03:28,940","03:32,340","\"I remember the second I heard these guys talk and I freaked out.\""]
["03:32,340","03:35,940","\"Yeah, even like the average villager had voice acting.\""]
["03:35,940","03:38,540","\"No, they trick you with that.\""]
["03:38,540","03:39,740","\"We're cheering for you.\""]
["03:39,740","03:42,240","\"That guy specifically is cheering for you.\""]
["03:42,240","03:44,740","\"Think about him while you play.\""]
["03:45,840","03:49,300","\"If this was real, they would all be swarming him, giving him, like, Corona and shit.\""]
["03:49,300","03:52,920","\"-Coffing on his shoes. -They'd be giving him Conflue.\""]
["03:52,920","03:57,240","\"They turned out-- They canceled basketball, Chris.\""]
["03:57,240","03:59,100","\"Don't call him Titus.\""]
["03:59,100","04:00,600","\"-Sweet. -Sweetfoe.\""]
["04:00,600","04:02,600","\"-Sweetfoe. -Sootheth.\""]
["04:02,600","04:06,840","\"-It's friend of Judith. -Sootheth's kind of a Judith.\""]
["04:06,840","04:09,200","\"-There we go. -All right.\""]
["04:09,200","04:10,960","\"-Sootheth. -I like that.\""]
["04:10,960","04:13,120","\"Blitzballs look so fun to kick around.\""]
["04:13,880","04:17,760","\"Let's balls are read for your pleasure or there I guess they're studded for your pleasure\""]
["04:17,760","04:21,880","\"That's right. My dad is jacked. Yeah, jacked is awesome\""]
["04:21,880","04:26,600","\"Jacked is awesome. He's the only one that sees you for the little twinkas that you truly are\""]
["04:26,600","04:32,000","\"That's true. You kicked that thing on the knob would it hurt each individual nub is the app piece of steel\""]
["04:32,000","04:36,680","\"Messes your shins up every time you kick it balloon filled with acid\""]
["04:40,120","04:42,120","\"Wait what?\""]
["04:42,120","04:46,640","\"Thanks for bailing me out strange child who apparently manages my time\""]
["04:46,640","04:54,300","\"All of them in sync. I don't like this cultist shit. Yeah, this is fucking weird and their faces are horrifying. That's jacked\""]
["04:54,300","04:56,680","\"Dude, he's so cool\""]
["04:56,680","05:02,500","\"He is honestly one of like the coolest final fantasy characters despite him only being in this game for like 10 minutes\""]
["05:02,500","05:09,720","\"I think I think Oran lives up to his his cool design. Aren't pretty cool. Yeah, he's got pretty like plump lips\""]
["05:09,720","05:12,560","\"Yeah, he's got he's making a weird ass face right there\""]
["05:12,560","05:17,520","\"Running away from home when I heard the news when I frozen\""]
["05:17,520","05:26,560","\"Who is this this isn't Titus saying this is supposed to be like some guy on the radio. I think\""]
["05:35,560","05:40,920","\"This is awesome. Do they have like the death metal growls in this this part? Yeah. Yeah sing along\""]
["05:40,920","05:52,640","\"That's the red man friend of method man holder of milk\""]
["05:52,640","05:59,880","\"Delicious he's gonna have the strongest bones. He's gonna regrow his arm. Oh, that's so cool\""]
["05:59,880","06:02,140","\"This is nostalgic\""]
["06:02,140","06:07,560","\"So Tomar you said you were a big fan of blitzball in this game. I definitely was I\""]
["06:07,560","06:13,620","\"Could I don't even remember how to play it now, but I remember I didn't understand it at all\""]
["06:13,620","06:17,700","\"Or I didn't want to or care. I think the game makes you play a game of it\""]
["06:17,700","06:24,460","\"Like there's no point in playing until you start learning the jack shots, and then those are basically guaranteed points\""]
["06:24,460","06:29,700","\"That's how I always played these kinds of games if it worked it works. Yeah, you're here now\""]
["06:29,700","06:33,460","\"Which means you didn't die in the crossfire. I did not die in the game\""]
["06:33,460","06:40,260","\"Which in turn makes you die in real life. Exactly. I remember when I first saw this it blew my mind\""]
["06:40,260","06:46,820","\"Yeah, me too. It looks so real. It still holds up. Yeah, it looks good. Yeah, I can't say it's ugly\""]
["06:46,820","06:53,060","\"They almost got crushed by that Caesar head. Did this come out first or Kingdom Hearts one?\""]
["06:53,060","06:57,360","\"Um, I think this I think this was\""]
["06:59,060","07:03,880","\"I remember okay, so it must have been this was when I was like wow particle effects are so fucking cool\""]
["07:03,880","07:07,320","\"He's flapping he's trying to put on all that fire\""]
["07:07,320","07:13,580","\"It's cuz he's asymmetrical with his weird fishnet legging I\""]
["07:13,580","07:18,400","\"Like asymmetrical character design, but I don't like his design\""]
["07:18,400","07:23,280","\"Close in this game or ridiculous. Yeah, I\""]
["07:24,240","07:29,020","\"Don't even remember this little goon like he like his like his elbows like a Chinese finger trap\""]
["07:29,020","07:32,700","\"It's true\""]
["07:32,700","07:36,540","\"I don't remember that kid either goddamn\""]
["07:36,540","07:42,180","\"Does he ever come back? No, yeah, that kid's relevant. He's like a big plot thing\""]
["07:42,180","07:48,100","\"Really? I don't I've beaten this game and I don't remember his existence. Okay big plot thing is probably being generous\""]
["07:48,100","07:52,780","\"But I feel like it's some twist like oh, it's this person traveling through time\""]
["07:52,780","07:54,780","\"It's a prep like that.\""]
["07:54,780","07:56,780","\"Oh!\""]
["07:56,780","07:58,780","\"Cool!\""]
["07:58,780","08:00,780","\"You did that all on your own?\""]
["08:00,780","08:02,780","\"What's the thing that destroys the world?\""]
["08:02,780","08:03,780","\"Oh yeah, it's sin.\""]
["08:03,780","08:05,780","\"Yeah, it's like a big weird blue whale.\""]
["08:05,780","08:07,780","\"It's weird.\""]
["08:07,780","08:10,780","\"It kind of looks like the Cloverfield monster, I think.\""]
["08:10,780","08:16,780","\"All these plots are like, they're just really like high stakes basic bitch fantasy plots the end of the day.\""]
["08:16,780","08:21,780","\"The source of pure evil needs to be defeated by the source of pure good.\""]
["08:21,780","08:24,540","\"I do remember this thing actually seeming like,\""]
["08:24,540","08:27,040","\"oh shit, when it showed up.\""]
["08:27,040","08:28,880","\"- No way, ugh.\""]
["08:28,880","08:30,000","\"- It's huge.\""]
["08:30,000","08:31,980","\"- I'll beat you with my finger trap.\""]
["08:31,980","08:34,240","\"(laughing)\""]
["08:34,240","08:35,080","\"- Take it.\""]
["08:35,080","08:37,200","\"- Take it.\""]
["08:37,200","08:38,040","\"- He's so fucking cool.\""]
["08:38,040","08:38,880","\"- Yeah.\""]
["08:38,880","08:39,720","\"- Here it is.\""]
["08:39,720","08:43,160","\"He gives you a sweet ass fucking Swiss army knife.\""]
["08:43,160","08:44,760","\"- Does he either bother taking his other arm\""]
["08:44,760","08:46,120","\"out of the little sling?\""]
["08:46,120","08:48,160","\"- Does it work?\""]
["08:48,160","08:49,120","\"- I don't, maybe it doesn't.\""]
["08:49,120","08:50,440","\"Maybe he's like Bob Dole.\""]
["08:50,440","08:51,360","\"- Oh yeah, it does.\""]
["08:51,360","08:53,520","\"He's got a rough in his belly right now.\""]
["08:53,520","08:57,040","\"- Orin also in his the Bob Dole or Final Fantasy.\""]
["08:57,040","08:58,040","\"- Exactly.\""]
["08:58,040","09:01,200","\"This game is just straight up turn-based though, right?\""]
["09:01,200","09:04,280","\"It's not, it doesn't have the ATB system or whatever.\""]
["09:04,280","09:05,120","\"I don't know.\""]
["09:05,120","09:07,760","\"- Yeah, I don't think there's anything like the ATB.\""]
["09:07,760","09:10,160","\"- You can see in the right the order that things are gonna attack.\""]
["09:10,160","09:12,920","\"- Yeah, if we look at the right trigger thing, yeah.\""]
["09:12,920","09:16,800","\"- So Monster A is next, so if you kill that, you can eliminate its turn.\""]
["09:16,800","09:19,920","\"- Oh, that's cool.\""]
["09:19,920","09:21,280","\"Damn, I forget all this.\""]
["09:21,280","09:22,280","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:22,280","09:24,940","\"This is cool that they kind of surround you and stuff.\""]
["09:24,940","09:29,520","\"Like they don't do the traditional three guys in a line kind of thing.\""]
["09:29,520","09:31,360","\"I don't remember that, but...\""]
["09:31,360","09:34,280","\"I think it's just certain battles that happens in.\""]
["09:34,280","09:37,280","\"Sometimes they do just do the head-on.\""]
["09:37,280","09:40,120","\"Is that sand or is that just like a little...\""]
["09:40,120","09:41,480","\"I guess that's just like a sand...\""]
["09:41,480","09:43,280","\"It's wiggly-niggly, you stupid.\""]
["09:43,280","09:44,280","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:44,280","09:46,120","\"Whoa, what?\""]
["09:46,120","09:51,320","\"It's uh, actually canonically in the Hershey's mythos.\""]
["09:51,320","09:57,120","\"A wiggly-niggly is that thing at the end of a Hershey's kiss, the little uh, paper thing.\""]
["09:57,120","09:58,120","\"That's a real-\""]
["09:58,120","10:01,120","\"Does that sound like a lie, Tomar?\""]
["10:01,120","10:04,120","\"That sounds kinda like you lie, I'm not gonna lie.\""]
["10:04,120","10:05,120","\"Who, Arin?\""]
["10:05,120","10:05,620","\"Yeah.\""]
["10:05,620","10:08,620","\"Also, your little lie did sound kinda true somehow, I don't know why.\""]
["10:08,620","10:10,120","\"That's actually what it's called.\""]
["10:10,120","10:11,120","\"Wait, really?\""]
["10:11,120","10:11,620","\"Yes.\""]
["10:11,620","10:13,120","\"I swear to God, look it up.\""]
["10:13,120","10:15,620","\"Did I subconsciously just store that in my brain?\""]
["10:15,620","10:20,260","\"I feel like I've told you that before okay. There you go. But she makes you real\""]

["10:42,260","10:46,440","\"Young enough to just be like if it looks like a big explosion. It's good\""]
["10:46,440","10:49,300","\"You know yeah, that's perfect\""]
["10:49,300","10:53,140","\"That thing's gonna blow the wall at the top of it. There's a safe thing\""]
