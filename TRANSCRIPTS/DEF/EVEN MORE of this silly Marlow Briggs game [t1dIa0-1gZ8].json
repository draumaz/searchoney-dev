["00:04,400","00:05,600","\"With friends.\""]
["00:05,600","00:10,000","\"You know the way everyone's always like uh, the Hobbits should have been one movie?\""]
["00:10,000","00:12,200","\"Yeah, that one is one movie.\""]
["00:12,200","00:13,800","\"That one's the version.\""]
["00:13,800","00:15,000","\"I think that...\""]
["00:15,000","00:20,200","\"I think that uh, if Peter Jackson's movies were one movie, they'd be really weird.\""]
["00:20,200","00:23,200","\"Yeah, but wouldn't they be funny?\""]
["00:23,200","00:24,800","\"They would be funny.\""]
["00:24,800","00:25,800","\"See?\""]
["00:25,800","00:26,800","\"I still...\""]
["00:26,800","00:29,400","\"I feel like they could have cut out a lot of the shit.\""]
["00:29,400","00:35,000","\"format they did it for it could have totally been two movies and covered all the same material yeah\""]
["00:35,000","00:41,000","\"No, the third movie so there's a bunch of shit. That's not necessary. How come two legit never happen\""]
["00:41,000","00:43,960","\"Uh, they do like Kingsman\""]
["00:43,960","00:47,540","\"That's just because it wasn't gonna get a third\""]
["00:47,540","00:54,440","\"Kingsman - is so shit. Yeah, everyone I've heard I've never seen Kingsman - but everyone ever talked about it\""]
["00:54,440","00:58,240","\"Say that it's completely sucks it compares some of the first one weird\""]
["00:58,240","01:04,160","\"It's like they blow their load completely in Kingsman 2 like they do things in Kingsman 2\""]
["01:04,160","01:07,920","\"They really should have saved for Kingsman 3, but now it's obviously not gonna happen\""]
["01:07,920","01:13,960","\"Kingsman 1 is so cool. I haven't seen it, but I've been told that I would like it. It's it's like really unique\""]
["01:13,960","01:19,040","\"Okay, I'll give it a watch it. It's got really good music. It's all epic and\""]
["01:19,040","01:21,160","\"You know yeah\""]
["01:21,160","01:25,240","\"Now the only reason I haven't watched it honestly is because it's about those people\""]
["01:25,240","01:31,120","\"Those people like the British yes. Yeah, you're right. They can eat jelly deels\""]
["01:31,120","01:37,000","\"They call cookies biscuits. I mean what the ends with you biscuits are light and fluffy\""]
["01:37,000","01:40,440","\"Yeah, you can British naggle tooth monster with this\""]
["01:40,440","01:47,480","\"Also, I learned this the other day. Do you know that Big Ben isn't even that fucking tower. It's just the bell\""]
["01:47,720","01:54,040","\"Wait really yes big Ben is just the bell. I did not know that see friggin stupid man\""]
["01:54,040","01:58,400","\"I feel like that's also all almost misinformation that sounds to like made up\""]
["01:58,400","02:03,560","\"Also, the British really missed the ball there the Queen has like total diplomatic immunity\""]
["02:03,560","02:07,560","\"And she can fucking commit any crime that she wants to commit if the Queen\""]
["02:07,560","02:10,440","\"regularly does\""]
["02:10,440","02:15,800","\"This is actually a real thing if the Queen of England wanted to murder you she could do it legally\""]
["02:16,520","02:18,920","\"- Is there just a specific law that says,\""]
["02:18,920","02:21,980","\"by the way, anything a queen does is automatically law\""]
["02:21,980","02:25,040","\"by virtue of her legal, by virtue of her being\""]
["02:25,040","02:26,600","\"the person that makes the law?\""]
["02:26,600","02:31,440","\"- Yes, she, the only thing she can't do is get arrested.\""]
["02:31,440","02:32,800","\"- Can she get de-breasted?\""]
["02:32,800","02:33,640","\"- Maybe.\""]
["02:33,640","02:35,560","\"I think, I think as long as she does it to herself,\""]
["02:35,560","02:36,400","\"but no one else can do it to her.\""]
["02:36,400","02:37,400","\"- Why the fuck did an American--\""]
["02:37,400","02:38,400","\"- What if she did an amous--\""]
["02:38,400","02:39,760","\"- Cut the scalps off of people\""]
["02:39,760","02:41,440","\"when they could've cut the titties off of people,\""]
["02:41,440","02:42,720","\"that would've been better.\""]
["02:42,720","02:43,560","\"- And then they couldn't--\""]
["02:43,560","02:45,680","\"- It's the weirdest fucking question I ever heard.\""]
["02:45,680","02:48,320","\"Imagine like hanging like stuff breasts up on your wall.\""]
["02:48,320","02:51,760","\"That's terrible. That's equally terrible.\""]
["02:51,760","02:55,920","\"But it's cooler than fucking the scalp of your head.\""]
["02:55,920","02:56,920","\"That's boring.\""]
["02:56,920","02:59,360","\"Why would I want to scalp?\""]
["02:59,360","03:02,920","\"I think the whole point is to like humiliate you.\""]
["03:02,920","03:04,920","\"Well, then things should cut off my cock.\""]
["03:04,920","03:07,960","\"Actually, I have no idea what the point I'm scalping is.\""]
["03:07,960","03:10,640","\"I don't know. Maybe it was some kind of currency.\""]
["03:10,640","03:13,680","\"Maybe it is just the easiest thing for them to cut off really quickly.\""]
["03:13,840","03:18,320","\"Maybe I you could totally live without a scalp though, right? Yeah\""]
["03:18,320","03:23,280","\"Yeah, but you wouldn't be comfortable. Yeah, and that's what they that's where they really get you\""]
["03:23,280","03:27,560","\"Hmm. What if I put a super glue on the top of my head?\""]
["03:27,560","03:32,520","\"I mean if you can get the scalp back and reattach it I say go for it\""]
["03:32,520","03:37,760","\"What if I buy one of those you should keep the scalp though. What if I get one of those like rubber ball things\""]
["03:39,560","03:47,700","\"You just look the same but with rubber instead of real. I am rubber you are bald whatever. I am river you are real\""]
["03:47,700","03:52,160","\"What different phones off of my eel into the banana peel\""]
["03:52,160","04:01,960","\"That would be good let's do heal each other. Oh dude. Yeah, that'd be sick\""]
["04:01,960","04:06,820","\"I actually kind of did that one feeling is totally the new scalping\""]
["04:07,340","04:12,760","\"Once I'm uh, I had a kitchen knife and I had a really big callus on my foot and I just kind of saw it off\""]
["04:12,760","04:16,960","\"With like an actual saw like a serrated knife with a knife\""]
["04:16,960","04:22,880","\"The bottom my foot looks so fucked up and raw. I was funny\""]
["04:22,880","04:29,580","\"It's horrible. Did it once I swear I won't go there. I didn't get a bad infection and die at that whatever age that was\""]
["04:29,580","04:34,500","\"That was like a year ago. Let you get an infection and diet. What are you?\""]
["04:35,220","04:38,540","\"- Seven. - Yeah, I was 27 at the time.\""]
["04:38,540","04:41,260","\"- When I was a kid, my dad just fucking picked off\""]
["04:41,260","04:44,080","\"the nail of his pinky toe and just never acknowledged\""]
["04:44,080","04:44,920","\"that he did it.\""]
["04:44,920","04:46,220","\"- The entire nail?\""]
["04:46,220","04:48,020","\"- Yeah, he just pulled off the entire thing\""]
["04:48,020","04:49,340","\"and just acted like it was normal.\""]
["04:49,340","04:51,620","\"- Some people are fucking weird, did it grow back?\""]
["04:51,620","04:55,300","\"- I didn't fucking ask to see his feet every day.\""]
["04:55,300","04:57,060","\"- You don't wanna see daddy's feet every day?\""]
["04:57,060","04:58,060","\"- No. - Okay.\""]
["04:58,060","05:00,140","\"Well, a guy in my class, he picked a mole\""]
["05:00,140","05:01,340","\"off the back of his neck one time\""]
["05:01,340","05:02,340","\"when I was sitting next to him.\""]
["05:02,340","05:04,140","\"- Was he the guy that wanted to see his daddy's\""]
["05:04,140","05:05,140","\"feed every day.\""]
["05:05,140","05:06,140","\"I don't think so.\""]
["05:06,140","05:07,140","\"I'm from that story.\""]
["05:07,140","05:08,140","\"No.\""]
["05:08,140","05:09,140","\"Oh.\""]
["05:09,140","05:12,140","\"But he picked a mole off of his neck and it was just bleeding all over his shirt.\""]
["05:12,140","05:13,820","\"And I was like, \"\"Why would you do that?\"\"\""]
["05:13,820","05:15,260","\"And he was like, \"\"I think I might have to go home.\""]
["05:15,260","05:16,660","\"Like, we're whispering to each other.\""]
["05:16,660","05:18,580","\"There's blood all over his neck.\"\"\""]
["05:18,580","05:21,580","\"And then the teachers walked by and just like, \"\"What the fuck?\""]
["05:21,580","05:22,580","\"What's going on?\"\"\""]
["05:22,580","05:25,340","\"So like, \"\"Sir, I picked off a mole off the back of my neck.\"\"\""]
["05:25,340","05:28,380","\"So like, \"\"What'd you ever fucking go home?\"\"\""]
["05:28,380","05:33,220","\"I've definitely not with a mole, but like when I was like a teenager and used to get\""]
["05:33,220","05:38,620","\"acne if like I ever got one that was like big enough I just like fucking cut it off\""]
["05:38,620","05:43,700","\"With your I do that but just like with my fingernails would be real messy\""]
["05:43,700","05:49,680","\"What why won't he jump um I never had that bad of acne. Thank you. I didn't either\""]
["05:49,680","05:55,120","\"But I would I would have like very rare moments where I would my was pretty bad when I was in my high school\""]
["05:55,120","05:59,640","\"It's fucked up that if you pick it your acne and when you have it just fucks your face forever\""]
["05:59,640","06:06,620","\"I still know people who have like really scarred faces from back then. I'm actually surprised it didn't get me or at least not\""]
["06:06,620","06:10,420","\"Not noticeably bad. I know exactly what you're talking about though\""]
["06:10,420","06:15,580","\"I bet I do have face scars from when I was a kid for that exact reason\""]
["06:15,580","06:18,340","\"You ever get a zit on the bridge of your nose\""]
["06:18,340","06:23,240","\"Right on the bridge right at the top. I got one recently. It was weird\""]
["06:23,240","06:28,220","\"No, I don't think I've ever usually minor closer to the very bottom if I get them\""]
["06:28,220","06:30,220","\"You ever get a zit right on your pew pal?\""]
["06:30,220","06:33,220","\"Oh! Just instant game over screen.\""]
["06:33,220","06:35,220","\"Yeah, that was kind of cheap.\""]
["06:35,220","06:39,220","\"This game cheap? How dare you?\""]
["06:39,220","06:41,220","\"Okay, I'll take it back.\""]
["06:41,220","06:44,220","\"This reminds me of the Polar Express game.\""]
["06:44,220","06:46,220","\"Hot chocolate!\""]
["06:46,220","06:48,220","\"What pedigree?\""]
["06:48,220","06:50,220","\"Here we've only got one rule!\""]

["06:52,220","06:53,220","\"Really? Yeah.\""]

["06:59,920","07:02,380","\"Never ever let it cool!\""]
["07:02,380","07:03,380","\"[Laughs]\""]
["07:03,380","07:05,280","\"I- uh...\""]
["07:05,280","07:07,700","\"You know what I never got even as a kid?\""]
["07:07,700","07:09,860","\"I never got the appeal of those movies.\""]
["07:09,860","07:11,160","\"White Polar Express.\""]
["07:11,160","07:13,100","\"And I guess maybe...\""]
["07:13,100","07:16,580","\"Maybe to a lesser extent like Harry Potter, but not really.\""]
["07:16,580","07:20,020","\"But I never got the appeal of movies where it's just like...\""]
["07:20,020","07:23,100","\"Wouldn't it be cool if you were a kid and you went here?\""]
["07:23,100","07:23,600","\"It's like...\""]

["07:25,600","07:33,280","\"You suck love you have no child like wonder at all no\""]
["07:33,280","07:38,540","\"I'm just saying like what what does watching it another child be like whoa?\""]
["07:38,540","07:42,940","\"Oh the hot chocolate I could drink you stupid what does that do?\""]
["07:42,940","07:49,120","\"The point of that see this is a bunch of waiters flipping all over each other. It's not about the hot chocolate\""]
["07:49,120","07:51,680","\"If they were my waiter\""]
["07:52,760","07:58,400","\"God that's the whole point of having a protagonist is that you look through the world and you experience with them\""]
["07:58,400","08:01,520","\"They're just doing that shit for tips, but no like\""]
["08:01,520","08:06,000","\"They don't get tips for children going to Auschwitz\""]
["08:06,000","08:09,760","\"Is that where the polar Express stop?\""]
["08:09,760","08:17,760","\"Yeah, I didn't know that fucking uh, yeah, it could stop said Auschwitz the kids get out and they eat a bagel\""]
["08:17,760","08:19,760","\"They get out shorts to get out\""]
["08:20,360","08:23,880","\"Shwits. I mean it's modern day ashwits, so it's just like yeah\""]
["08:23,880","08:30,360","\"It's it's sort of weird that they're just taking these kids to Poland, but they got to teach them about history and so that it doesn't repeat itself\""]
["08:30,360","08:36,720","\"I mean I did I did see the the Holocaust Museum in DC when I was in middle school\""]
["08:36,720","08:40,320","\"But I also went to a Jewish school\""]

["08:45,920","08:48,560","\"Yeah, like I said, it was a private school. Oh\""]
["08:50,040","08:52,880","\"I have a school sounds really really weird.\""]
["08:52,880","08:55,640","\"My public school, so we lucked out\""]
["08:55,640","08:57,680","\"because there was some anonymous benefactor\""]
["08:57,680","08:58,520","\"that let us do this.\""]
["08:58,520","08:59,360","\"Skates crazy.\""]
["08:59,360","09:02,000","\"But when I was in high school drama,\""]

["09:09,920","09:11,800","\"to New York City for like a week.\""]
["09:11,800","09:12,640","\"That's cool.\""]
["09:12,640","09:15,480","\"And we saw a ton of Broadway musicals.\""]
["09:15,480","09:18,080","\"And you went with your school and stuff?\""]
["09:18,080","09:23,240","\"Yeah, like with my Repertory Theatre class, it was like, like maybe 15 of us went.\""]
["09:23,240","09:28,240","\"But it was all paid for by some anonymous benefactor.\""]
["09:28,240","09:33,720","\"When I was younger in school, I got to hear about American schools from my American\""]
["09:33,720","09:36,840","\"friends at the time and it used to piss me off so fucking bad.\""]

["09:46,840","09:50,920","\"I'm just like that is not fucking fair. I like we don't get to do any of that shit\""]
["09:50,920","09:55,160","\"You know picking our classes in high school that I can remember because I went to a public high school\""]
["09:55,160","10:00,280","\"And it was just like picking whether you wanted the harder version or the easier version of the class\""]
["10:00,280","10:06,480","\"And that was about and like which foreign language you wanted to learn. It's not fair fucking Americans are like\""]
["10:06,480","10:10,880","\"It's a study for the SATs and I had to take yes or no\""]
["10:10,880","10:16,760","\"And like an island with the right like huge fucking essays per fucking subject about everything and it's\""]
["10:16,760","10:17,760","\"It's really strenuous.\""]
["10:17,760","10:18,760","\"I still have nightmares about it.\""]
["10:18,760","10:22,640","\"That's a good thing about being in a giant overcrowded country is that no one's got\""]
