["04:29,640","04:36,120","\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah now there's an actual game to play. Would you like to play journey to the Nexus?\""]
["04:36,280","04:43,440","\"Yeah, I suppose I would so the backstory is there's demons and they're taking over the land with a white fog and\""]
["04:43,440","04:45,960","\"We have come to stop it\""]
["04:45,960","04:49,900","\"Is that the explanation of the white fog doors yes\""]
["04:49,900","04:56,400","\"Recruit she's gonna guide you to the Fisher. Oh\""]
["04:56,400","05:00,800","\"No Fishers. I will show you where the grocery store is\""]
["05:00,800","05:05,120","\"That's me being born. I shall guide you to the butcher\""]
["05:05,120","05:09,660","\"If you were an expectant mother and this guy just walked out of you indifferently\""]
["05:09,660","05:12,760","\"Harlequin\""]
["05:12,760","05:13,700","\"Just\""]
["05:13,700","05:15,700","\"Passionately walks right out\""]
["05:15,700","05:18,800","\"Hey\""]
["05:18,800","05:20,800","\"This is the ps5, huh?\""]
["05:20,800","05:28,160","\"The one only and true I want to see you really use that club is it just me or is the recording look different?\""]
["05:28,160","05:30,660","\"He looks really red in the recording look at that\""]
["05:30,660","05:34,640","\"Yeah, he looks way redder in the recording whatever it is we can deal with it for now\""]
["05:34,640","05:44,140","\"Look another guy is that a real man. Yeah, is that the man stood here? That's a man in another dimension\""]
["05:44,140","05:50,200","\"Look at me go look at me go. I'm a little red guy. Wow. We in a big demon souls world\""]
["05:50,200","05:55,200","\"What do you think of the graphics holy crap? I think they look good\""]
["05:55,200","05:58,840","\"Shut up\""]
["05:58,840","06:02,240","\"Don't hurt me\""]
["06:02,340","06:06,340","\"Let's try to like blast through this whole part. So does that does look real slick?\""]
["06:06,340","06:12,940","\"Does this play the same as the other one or is this like smoother? Oh, it seems smoother. I mean, I don't really know\""]
["06:12,940","06:20,580","\"Like it I haven't played the other one in the wall. It definitely looks like it animates a little differently not in a bad way\""]
["06:20,580","06:25,820","\"But I I don't know if like the exact frame data would be used, you know what I mean?\""]
["06:25,820","06:31,780","\"I read somewhere that they pretty much use the exact same code. So I have no idea. Maybe that's fake\""]
["06:31,780","06:36,460","\"Yeah, they probably if this was a port or remaster, I'm sure they had the original source code\""]
["06:36,460","06:42,700","\"Well, we were actually just talking about this in another recording, but it was a remaster of a PS3 game\""]
["06:42,700","06:48,780","\"It is a PS3 game that is a good one. We had like a bunch of weird architecture and that's why a lot of the ports are weird\""]
["06:48,780","06:51,760","\"But it used the same engine as dark\""]
["06:51,760","06:58,380","\"I'm sure it was on PC and I'm sure it's still mostly written in C++ regardless of the architecture. Yeah, that's true\""]
["06:58,380","07:00,380","\"I\""]
["07:00,380","07:06,360","\"I think blue point specifically is one of the few studios that's somehow able to like unravel that\""]
["07:06,360","07:13,140","\"Because they did the remaster of the Uncharted games and they play exactly identical to the remaster of the Uncharted's yeah\""]
["07:13,140","07:16,860","\"I didn't know that I thought they just did the shadow of the colossal\""]
["07:16,860","07:24,140","\"Yeah, they did that too. Mmm your childhood remastered just bring it to them and your parents will be good to you this time\""]
["07:24,140","07:29,140","\"They made the environments look good, but they sure did fuck up the designs of everything\""]
["07:29,140","07:37,000","\"I mean as somebody who doesn't have a lot of skin in the game because I didn't really play much of the original\""]
["07:37,000","07:42,440","\"I think it looks fine, but that's that's just me not really not really knowing better\""]
["07:42,440","07:47,680","\"It definitely feels a lot brighter than its predecessor\""]
["07:47,680","07:55,080","\"Hmm probably is like I get that they're showing off a lot of the new lighting engine too, but like\""]
["07:56,660","08:05,640","\"Did you play the original? Yeah, I played it too, but my cousin gave it to me almost is like a fuck you like not mean\""]
["08:05,640","08:10,780","\"But like dude isn't it funny like this game just fucks you up, and I was like yeah, that's cool\""]
["08:10,780","08:14,660","\"But it's not fun. I think this is a very fun game\""]
["08:14,660","08:16,340","\"It's just a personal taste thing\""]
["08:16,340","08:22,780","\"But Sekiro is almost like it gets rid of every single thing that I find like kind of annoying or like\""]
["08:23,260","08:25,260","\"S.A.R.L.E.S.O.T.R.C. about Dark Souls.\""]
["08:25,260","08:27,500","\"I'm not saying that I'm right.\""]
["08:27,500","08:30,340","\"Well, I am, but you don't have to agree with me.\""]
["08:30,340","08:35,940","\"But clearly somebody at FromSoft does. This guy's more careful than his brother. Come on.\""]
["08:35,940","08:38,940","\"How do you know they're related? He's blue.\""]
["08:38,940","08:42,300","\"So they're all related. My god, fuck this guy.\""]
["08:42,300","08:45,340","\"What the fuck did that alert you?\""]
["08:45,340","08:52,980","\"Oh my god! That was very cheeky of you! Did you not see him? I did. I just thought I had time. Look at that!\""]
["08:52,980","08:54,980","\"Have you ever seen such physics?\""]
["08:54,980","09:00,200","\"Dang, it's got like actual mass. I know\""]
["09:00,200","09:08,300","\"It's like going to actual mass another thing about this is I was very much a fan of the original music and this game\""]
["09:08,300","09:12,500","\"Turned all of it into generic Hollywood shit\""]
["09:12,500","09:17,340","\"Is it like remixes of the same songs or is it just something like different other times?\""]
["09:17,340","09:19,900","\"It's completely different like I don't know\""]
["09:19,900","09:25,320","\"It just seems like they went for the most generic thing they could have possibly done and just and the fuck that thing was everyone's like\""]
["09:25,320","09:30,560","\"The old music was shitty mid-eye. It's like no it was an orchestra. They just had less instruments and it sounded good\""]
["09:30,560","09:33,180","\"hmm, and it\""]
["09:33,180","09:36,660","\"It's the brass was up really close to the microphone. So it sounded all like\""]
["09:36,660","09:42,180","\"But I thought it was cool. I thought it suited it because like in all like medieval shit\""]
["09:42,180","09:47,240","\"That's the kind of brass you'd usually see like being played around the time and shit\""]
["09:47,860","09:50,740","\"Yeah, I feel like there's certain things where\""]
["09:50,740","09:55,660","\"People have gotten so used to hearing them like mixed and like\""]
["09:55,660","09:59,340","\"Recorded that they kind of forget what they actually\""]
["09:59,340","10:07,180","\"Sound like my big thing and and I don't know if any audio engineers actually agree with this is\""]
["10:07,180","10:12,700","\"On a drum kit when you hit the crash that is the loudest fucking thing on the drum kit\""]
["10:12,700","10:16,220","\"Yeah, but like anytime like drums are in music\""]
["10:16,220","10:18,220","\"It's always about like the kick in the snare\""]
["10:18,220","10:24,340","\"So the crash is always like this like little like in the background and I hate that\""]
["10:24,340","10:29,740","\"Are you big brute this thing looks stupid? He's got nipples\""]
["10:29,740","10:37,540","\"He's got long nipples look at that shit. Why would you add that? I like how when you smack his ass at jiggles?\""]
["10:37,540","10:42,100","\"I never noticed that I actually like that. Oh\""]
["10:45,100","10:47,100","\"Can I pick this thing?\""]
["10:47,100","10:49,100","\"It's a little butt dingle.\""]
["10:49,100","10:51,100","\"I'm actually amazed at that. I never even noticed that.\""]
["10:51,100","10:53,100","\"Is this uh...\""]
["10:53,100","10:56,100","\"Are you supposed to beat him or is he like the uh...\""]

["11:02,100","11:05,100","\"You're supposed to be able to fucking stop hurting. No!\""]
["11:05,100","11:09,100","\"I love smacking this thing's fat ass.\""]
["11:09,100","11:13,100","\"It's oddly satisfying in like a way that...\""]
["11:13,100","11:20,080","\"I'd rather not work out right now one thing I don't understand is why they wouldn't give you an option to have the original music\""]
["11:20,080","11:22,080","\"It's like the easiest thing to implement\""]
["11:22,080","11:24,280","\"And then you're not upsetting anybody\""]
["11:24,280","11:29,040","\"Is that what art is truly about Chris not upsetting anybody?\""]
["11:29,040","11:33,800","\"I mean you shouldn't be overwriting something that someone else's vision and\""]
["11:33,800","11:39,820","\"Rooning it. I don't know. It's fine to a newcomer. I guess. Oh, yeah, you won't notice\""]
["11:41,880","11:46,340","\"But for the people who really love the original like your boy Chrissy\""]
["11:46,340","11:51,720","\"Just think it's kind of I don't think those are even necessarily nipples. Oh\""]
["11:51,720","11:57,640","\"You die I really wanted to see this however the Nexus traps you well at least\""]
["11:57,640","12:01,820","\"That is how you are slapped\""]

["13:10,780","13:16,940","\"So he's like half of something. I just thought it was just the effect of working in that specific place for so long\""]
["13:16,940","13:18,900","\"It might be maybe I'm wrong\""]
["13:18,900","13:24,260","\"That is one thing that's cool about these games is a lot of the story isn't really told to you other than\""]
["13:24,260","13:29,820","\"Through visual cues and environments. Yeah, I think that that's something that\""]
["13:30,260","13:34,580","\"Video games do particularly well over movies and stuff like that\""]
