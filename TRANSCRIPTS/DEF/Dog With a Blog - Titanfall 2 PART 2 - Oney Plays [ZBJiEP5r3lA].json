["01:23,160","01:24,040","\"Just like Neo.\""]
["01:24,040","01:28,740","\"Cory, you spread misinfo is so fucking hard it's ridiculous Mr. info, thank you.\""]
["01:28,740","01:30,240","\"I'm a compulsive liar.\""]

["01:39,040","01:41,340","\"Yeah, well here's the problem.\""]

["01:47,040","01:48,040","\"It's like I'm an infant.\""]
["01:48,040","01:50,040","\"My brain only goes so quickly.\""]
["01:50,040","01:53,740","\"So that's why I have to sometimes interrupt to say what I say because I'm firing off on\""]

["02:00,540","02:03,460","\"I just have to get it out of the split second or else I'll forget it.\""]
["02:03,460","02:05,380","\"Object permanence becomes secondary.\""]
["02:05,380","02:08,180","\"So I don't even know what that means.\""]
["02:08,180","02:13,220","\"It's like that thing where like if somebody leaves a room, you're aware that they don't\""]
["02:13,220","02:15,980","\"cease to exist.\""]
["02:15,980","02:21,420","\"I think dogs have that.\""]

["03:05,280","03:07,160","\"On your mind\""]
["03:07,160","03:10,900","\"Yeah, again, this might sound really wrong, but I'm not sure because I'm no expert\""]
["03:10,900","03:15,860","\"But I've been thinking it might be immoral for dogs to even exist anymore\""]
["03:15,860","03:20,360","\"Because they can't really live good lives\""]
["03:20,360","03:24,980","\"really unless they live out on farms or things but people living in towns and\""]
["03:24,980","03:29,320","\"cities I don't know it just doesn't seem right to me I think it's funny they're\""]
["03:29,320","03:33,920","\"funny but that's about it huh you're also stupid and rely on us so much and\""]
["03:33,920","03:36,560","\"they'll run at the traffic and die without us well there's definitely things\""]
["03:36,560","03:40,360","\"like pugs that you shouldn't shouldn't be real those are foul I kind of wish\""]
["03:40,360","03:43,760","\"that they would all be exterminated like I feel like dogs you have to keep in\""]

["12:08,560","12:13,260","\"Or ma'am. I think the biggest problem is that they don't say anything useful\""]
["12:13,540","12:18,220","\"They all just say exactly what you expect them to say. I feel like a lot of anything properly\""]
["12:18,220","12:21,120","\"I feel like a lot of them don't play the game either because if you read these articles\""]
["12:21,120","12:25,560","\"They have a lot to say about their first level experience, but they don't play beyond that. Yeah\""]
["12:25,560","12:27,540","\"Yeah, at the same time\""]

["12:47,420","12:52,740","\"I know what this is about you know if I'm playing an open-world game and it starts like scattering the same objectives\""]

["13:09,800","13:15,480","\"It's just that the one thing I hate in open-world games is you're gonna get that repetition no matter what\""]
["13:15,480","13:20,720","\"But it's how they do it. That's really annoying like is it shallow or is it like the repetition?\""]

["13:52,960","13:59,520","\"It's the most sandboxy fun style of open world and I guess another one that I had a horrible experience with but I still vouch\""]
["13:59,520","14:04,920","\"By it was horizon zero dawn. That was actually pretty fun. Never played it. Really?\""]
