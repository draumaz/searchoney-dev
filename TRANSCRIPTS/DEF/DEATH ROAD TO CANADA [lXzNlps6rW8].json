["00:33,400","00:35,080","\"- 'Cause you're a friend of dog in charming,\""]
["00:35,080","00:36,240","\"'cause that was the only thing that was available\""]
["00:36,240","00:37,520","\"at the time. Is that okay?\""]
["00:37,520","00:39,360","\"- Wait, what were my characteristics?\""]

["00:50,200","00:51,960","\"that Canada is a safe place.\""]
["00:51,960","00:53,200","\"Three of the threat of zombies,\""]

["00:56,640","00:58,000","\"- That's scary.\""]
["00:58,000","01:02,360","\"Besides to brave the death road and travel north many traders offer you different things\""]
["01:02,360","01:06,680","\"Sitting on how much food you have yeah, so in this game food is currency\""]
["01:06,680","01:12,620","\"Like gas isn't as important as food because obviously in the end of the world scenario food would be a high commodity\""]
["01:12,620","01:16,840","\"Okay, then music is like good, but it's very unfitting I agree\""]
["01:16,840","01:20,700","\"I love the music in this game, but it seems like it never suits no\""]
["01:20,700","01:23,000","\"It's like we said it we we were just listening to mom\""]
["01:23,000","01:27,180","\"We go to the rest stop house of the row house on the road or y'all mine do the rest up\""]
["01:27,180","01:32,760","\"I'm gonna tell you right now if you ever go to a mart it's probably the worst place to go because that's where they will always expect\""]
["01:32,760","01:37,280","\"High risk high reward. Yeah, but if you start with the rest stop at least early game\""]
["01:37,280","01:40,200","\"You should find a lot of like fucking chips and stuff on the ground\""]
["01:40,200","01:42,920","\"Alright\""]
["01:42,920","01:45,280","\"Is mild yeah, just starting so\""]
["01:45,280","01:48,480","\"Okay, so you have no weapon\""]
["01:48,480","01:54,660","\"I got a flashlight. Is that what I'm holding you can punch people I think Chris you have a fucking knife\""]
["01:54,660","01:56,660","\"So Chris is already like\""]
["01:56,660","01:58,660","\"Do I sh-\""]

["02:00,660","02:04,660","\"Is this- do you control this stuff in real time? Let's boogie.\""]
["02:04,660","02:06,660","\"Yeah, yeah, I'll see you can punch.\""]
["02:06,660","02:10,660","\"So that you can literally break human bodies apart with your fist.\""]
["02:10,660","02:12,660","\"Just like in real life.\""]
["02:12,660","02:14,660","\"I don't have to worry about a broken weapon or anything.\""]
["02:14,660","02:15,660","\"Oh you do.\""]
["02:15,660","02:20,660","\"Yeah, no trust me. Like you think like you can fend yourself, but zombies are fucking tough.\""]
["02:20,660","02:23,660","\"I'll try and keep you alive Chris, but it's gonna be hard.\""]
["02:23,660","02:25,660","\"Please try your best.\""]
["02:25,660","02:30,900","\"So we got a we got a little hamburger already. That's good. It was only one knock the phones out\""]
["02:30,900","02:39,540","\"The stuff that's glowing you want to kind of go to okay. I see now. I'm not very good at this game because it's kind of hard but uh\""]
["02:39,540","02:44,760","\"I'll kind of like move quickly through it. If you check the room and see anything blinking tell me\""]
["02:44,760","02:49,560","\"I don't really see anything. Yeah, I'm looking. I don't want to fuck around in rooms too long sure there wasn't another door\""]
["02:49,560","02:55,260","\"Huh, you sure there was another door. I don't know what up there. Yeah, there's one up here\""]
["02:55,260","02:59,720","\"Yeah, this rest up kind of sucks. Oh, there's stuff in the toilets fuel\""]
["02:59,720","03:07,400","\"Yeah, cuz there's feces. I guess those fire diesel. Yeah our engine runs on poops. Could that really happen?\""]
["03:07,400","03:09,400","\"Could you theoretically oh?\""]
["03:09,400","03:14,980","\"What what's up Chris? I mean if it was a normal engine you'd have to know I'm just coming in\""]
["03:14,980","03:19,220","\"Oh, you're free. Oh, well. Oh my god. We have to go in this room. I'm sorry. We have to do a lot of stuff\""]
["03:19,220","03:22,820","\"There's a lot of stuff on a gun. You're telling my huge shoot, right?\""]
["03:23,820","03:29,060","\"I mean apparently be careful. I don't know Chris. I was gonna die the first fucking room dude\""]
["03:29,060","03:32,860","\"I didn't know you had a gun. Oh my god. Well, I'm out of ammo, but\""]

["03:45,340","03:47,700","\"But as to get I've never beaten this this game is\""]
["03:47,700","03:53,540","\"Like unbelievably difficult it is but it's that's what makes it good Chris you fucking you way\""]
["03:53,540","03:59,240","\"You traded your you trained your knife for the tennis racket. I just wanted a good trade\""]
["03:59,240","04:04,780","\"It's a horrible fucking trade knives have like a just too violent, but it's true. I\""]
["04:04,780","04:10,740","\"Don't know. There's anything to starting a car if it wastes gas. I think it might waste gas\""]
["04:10,740","04:13,140","\"We got a bunch of gas we got food\""]
["04:13,140","04:19,420","\"You need at least like four food to eat I think abandoned campground with a fire pit Chris even finds an old\""]
["04:20,060","04:25,400","\"Pack a marshmallow yes. Do you want to eat marshmallows or tell stories? I see we eat the marshmallows\""]
["04:25,400","04:32,520","\"Group sets up camp then eats a huge bag of marshmallows instead of eating dinner nice. There's okay. Well, that's good\""]
["04:32,520","04:37,560","\"Yeah, it's worked out. How did you get food from marshmallows for not eating dinner? You just did\""]
["04:37,560","04:40,960","\"Okay, so infested city\""]
["04:40,960","04:46,000","\"Scrouting it all right, so it looks like it's not super threatening the bookstore\""]
["04:46,480","04:52,280","\"Again, like we don't always want to just go to like the fucking boring places like bookstores and like libraries\""]
["04:52,280","04:55,320","\"And sure it does sound like a place to find them cool weapons\""]
["04:55,320","04:59,060","\"But I don't know the sporting good store is a place to find good weapons\""]
["04:59,060","05:03,680","\"I feel like it's the bookstore might have like gas and fucking snacks\""]
["05:03,680","05:07,160","\"But I feel like sporting goods makes more sense. Let's go for it\""]
["05:07,160","05:12,560","\"It's still early on it starts becoming hard pretty soon. Oh this song rocks\""]
["05:12,560","05:15,480","\"Yeah, this song's really good, but I don't think of zombies\""]
["05:15,480","05:20,660","\"I don't think I'm right. I think like a guy is knife. He's got both. Okay, Chris. Good thing every night\""]
