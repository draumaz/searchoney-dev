["00:10,320","00:16,100","\"There's Yoda. Whoa, it's a secret. Oh, oh is it so this wasn't even necessary, but we did it\""]
["00:16,100","00:22,720","\"Muzor Yoda everybody is impressed. Yeah, the comments just subscribed. Oh\""]
["00:22,720","00:29,720","\"I like that that isn't you can run fast. Yeah, but that splashes. Yeah, it's a good sound\""]
["00:29,720","00:34,880","\"Watch out don't fall down where should I go from here because that's a circle I'd be going at\""]
["00:34,880","00:41,400","\"The most satisfying thing ever is listening to - run across the water in the Incredibles\""]
["00:41,400","00:44,160","\"The little slapping noises\""]
["00:44,160","00:48,600","\"Love that do like when he gets shot. I love that too\""]
["00:48,600","00:55,420","\"Very brave of them to have a moment like that in that movie. I can't believe they shot -\""]
["00:56,600","01:01,120","\"She gives them a whole speech about how they're gonna die. What if he was the main kid says you're going to die you kids\""]
["01:01,120","01:06,880","\"Are going to die you have no chance you're going to die remember. I don't know how you found that that was her pep talk\""]
["01:06,880","01:14,760","\"You are an actual genius when it comes to Sonic look we got a thing that's got a coin and a rolled coin\""]
["01:14,760","01:18,880","\"Whatever that is I don't know that's the coin from Sonic. Oh special stage\""]
["01:22,440","01:26,680","\"And I get to play nights get all the wubles whoops, you fucked up\""]
["01:26,680","01:31,480","\"This is really weird with an analog stick\""]
["01:31,480","01:38,640","\"It's a very satisfying noise it is I always liked it a lot. I'm glad they're using all the original sounds\""]
["01:38,640","01:41,760","\"holy smokes\""]
["01:41,760","01:46,600","\"I'm wowed by these graphics. That was a really pretty sequence. I\""]
["01:47,240","01:52,200","\"Wasn't really saying it because I was I was in awe there we go. We got it\""]
["01:52,200","01:56,120","\"Good job. What a cool idea for a special stage\""]
["01:56,120","01:59,560","\"Knights bonus. Are they all like that or is it just no?\""]
["01:59,560","02:03,400","\"Yeah, you play Knights for all of them. I guess you unlocked it now, too\""]
["02:03,400","02:06,240","\"So you can just do it when you want that's very cool. Oh\""]
["02:06,240","02:15,400","\"Homing attacking that way\""]
["02:16,200","02:18,200","\"It is cute how she says that\""]

["02:22,940","02:30,380","\"Why does she annoy you so much the only reason Navian noise me is because she keeps coming up\""]
["02:30,380","02:33,200","\"It's only because she keeps saying things that we already know\""]
["02:33,200","02:38,520","\"Yeah, and she always pops up right as you figured something out on your own and then she takes it away from you\""]
["02:38,520","02:42,200","\"I don't like that it pops up when you're Z targeting. I think that's the annoyance\""]
["02:42,200","02:47,920","\"I have why if you're targeting an enemy she always has to shout something why are there three egg man's cuz one's fake\""]
["02:47,920","02:50,880","\"The one that makes the shock wave is real\""]
["02:50,880","02:53,840","\"see\""]
["02:53,840","03:00,400","\"It probably wanted to have like a that was bullshit like a hologram effect or something. Oh you got him. Oh, that was fast\""]
["03:00,400","03:05,400","\"Well done. I still gotta get used to it a little bit on the controller, but it feels pretty good\""]
["03:05,400","03:11,260","\"You got a sound test on a lot. Oh, I remember this one too. And this looks way different than when I played this\""]
["03:11,260","03:17,680","\"Love that background. Holy shit. This is cool looking. Yeah the lighting so Eggman's had a castle all these years\""]
["03:17,680","03:19,680","\"Yeah, apparently oh\""]
["03:19,680","03:23,820","\"My god, I can't believe it. Did you get the money to build all this?\""]
["03:23,820","03:26,320","\"I can't believe I'm playing this level again. What is that?\""]
["03:26,320","03:32,940","\"Thing you hold on to I guess oh oh it's a catapult thing. It's got a fling me though. It has momentum as\""]
["03:32,940","03:35,380","\"Does everything in Sonic?\""]
["03:35,380","03:40,940","\"That's so cool. Oh, you just made it. No. Oh, I gotta go back\""]

["04:01,100","04:07,540","\"You didn't say watch out for the trees. That's true. You could have given me a warning. I could have helped you there\""]
["04:10,060","04:11,660","\"Jesus\""]
["04:11,660","04:13,500","\"You're so reckless\""]

["04:45,820","04:51,000","\"I have to keep forgetting that I wonder why the default is a bumper. Can you not change the controls? I probably could\""]
["04:51,000","04:58,480","\"Come on no those things suck and they like flip the camera around on frame one so completely disorient you it does\""]
["04:58,480","05:05,120","\"You know likey there you go you barely can make this stuff. You have to already be moving to\""]
["05:06,060","05:12,500","\"So there we go. Oh, I hope there's another checkpoint soon. What hit me? What I guess something shot me. Oh\""]
["05:12,500","05:15,780","\"Crips there we go. I\""]
["05:15,780","05:22,900","\"Love the aesthetic of this place. Yeah me too. It's fun and the music's really sick - okay\""]

["06:22,820","06:27,520","\"This is a better stage layout than what I remembered it being to they might have improved it\""]
["06:27,520","06:32,180","\"Oh, they definitely did a lot of this stuff wasn't there originally oh something shooting at you be careful\""]
["06:32,180","06:36,960","\"They're like giant egg man shields with all knights pushing them over there\""]
["06:36,960","06:41,140","\"Oh my god, man\""]
["06:41,140","06:46,100","\"No, I kind of hope they had a wall there to catch you\""]

["06:50,280","06:53,920","\"Rhett you got so far. No, he's a hedgehog\""]
["06:53,920","07:00,880","\"You want to hit that burning then get hurt a whole bunch like that. Yeah, they ain't gonna work\""]
["07:01,380","07:07,340","\"Not that doesn't grab any rings for me. Oh great. You got a life that you're gonna lose immediately\""]
["07:07,340","07:15,700","\"Mmm, I don't know where this is yeah, we're over here now. It is what it is\""]
["07:15,700","07:24,200","\"Thank you tales. Oh, I know where you are. This is the part you kept getting stuck at with the bounce pads and the the ball and chains\""]
["07:24,200","07:29,180","\"Oh, you're right. I'm on top of that way. Oh, okay, I'm going this way\""]
["07:29,980","07:35,520","\"But there we go. Yeah, you were right. We're learning. I just need to know the layout a little bit better\""]
["07:35,520","07:42,260","\"I've got I'm legitimately scared why cuz this level's so big. Yeah, you have to jump so\""]
["07:42,260","07:49,740","\"Dangerous it is I like the stage though. This is cool even if I'm not very good at it. I'm having a really fun time\""]
["07:49,740","07:58,080","\"What do you think of this castle Chris? I love it. I love the music. It's really like I'm making my way. Yeah, it's adventurous\""]

["08:01,680","08:02,680","\"Watch out.\""]
["08:02,680","08:03,680","\"I love this part.\""]
["08:03,680","08:05,680","\"This part is really cool.\""]
["08:05,680","08:09,760","\"You got to fling yourself across the whole map.\""]
["08:09,760","08:13,200","\"I'm glad too it's not automated like a lot of 3D Sonics.\""]
["08:13,200","08:15,080","\"That was the thing you had to do on your own there.\""]
["08:15,080","08:16,080","\"Yeah.\""]
["08:16,080","08:18,240","\"And it feels really good thanks to that.\""]
["08:18,240","08:21,040","\"It tells where are you because I don't feel like doing this part.\""]
["08:21,040","08:22,040","\"Oh.\""]

["08:35,000","08:38,140","\"Get them. So be careful. Oh my god\""]
["08:38,140","08:42,040","\"Probably even put it there on purpose to like discourage you from oh\""]
["08:42,040","08:44,840","\"too much speed\""]
["08:44,840","08:53,360","\"You're doing it there we go. Would you install a bounce pad in your house? Yeah, I probably break my legs every time I land\""]
["08:53,360","08:57,580","\"I'm sorry be fun like once I ever do get to buy a bigish house with like stairs\""]
["08:57,580","09:01,940","\"I'm definitely putting a slide next to it. Oh, that'd be fun. Now. Where am I gonna go from here?\""]
["09:01,940","09:05,960","\"And then when business people come in inside to have big business meetings will go\""]
["09:05,960","09:09,840","\"Come down the wacky slide if you want to have a meeting\""]

["09:34,840","09:36,840","\"What else we got oh\""]
["09:36,840","09:39,720","\"I didn't know it was a thin path damn\""]
["09:39,720","09:44,080","\"Well, that's what you get for rushing ahead. Yeah, you're supposed to take your time. It's sonic\""]
["09:45,800","09:53,280","\"Okay, that was wonder bar we go up we go in you're actually really good\""]
["09:53,280","09:59,160","\"And now we want to navigate down careful now that tricks you right there. That's such horseshit\""]
["09:59,160","10:05,240","\"Nope no doing that either you can do it you can do it. Yes. I\""]
["10:05,240","10:08,440","\"Hope you oh, thank God\""]

["10:18,360","10:24,280","\"Not quite\""]
["10:24,280","10:26,760","\"They do set these springs up a little weird you need to be\""]
["10:26,760","10:32,200","\"They do never seem to be quite exact you need to kind of be moving the way they already wanted you to be moving\""]
["10:32,200","10:39,360","\"But a lot of this level design is pretty solid. I know where I'm going a lot of the time. It's guiding me decently enough\""]
["10:39,360","10:41,360","\"Oh my god.\""]
["10:41,360","10:43,360","\"This is so cool.\""]

["10:46,360","10:47,360","\"We don't get to see it.\""]
["10:47,360","10:48,360","\"No, we don't.\""]
["10:48,360","10:49,360","\"Fuck!\""]

["10:55,360","10:57,360","\"What is going on?\""]
["10:57,360","10:58,360","\"You better start running.\""]
["10:58,360","10:59,360","\"Get out of here.\""]
["10:59,360","11:00,360","\"Oh my god.\""]
["11:00,360","11:01,360","\"This is so cool.\""]
["11:01,360","11:03,360","\"Are you getting chased by something?\""]

["11:06,360","11:07,360","\"Fuck!\""]
["11:07,360","11:08,360","\"I didn't know they would do that.\""]
["11:08,360","11:17,600","\"I like that you got to see both of them. I'm glad they both freaking died. Okay, so those guys push you if you hit them\""]
["11:17,600","11:19,600","\"So it better be a robo dragon\""]
["11:19,600","11:22,600","\"You think\""]
["11:22,600","11:25,780","\"I'm not seeing anything. I see tails. Hey, oh\""]
["11:25,780","11:29,080","\"Well now we know what's happening\""]
["11:29,080","11:35,040","\"That music's so cool careful\""]
["11:35,880","11:39,680","\"I hate that the spice take your speed like that. Oh\""]
["11:39,680","11:44,760","\"Like I misled I'm stupid that clearly that was gonna throw me back\""]
["11:44,760","11:58,800","\"You did it good job that was act one. That was only the first part\""]
["11:58,800","12:04,160","\"Jesus this is cool. No, this level is really cool. I like it a lot. I\""]
["12:05,000","12:07,600","\"I kind of wonder why they haven't done this in another Sonic game.\""]
["12:07,600","12:12,000","\"I'm sorry. I don't know the layout quite yet viewers. I'm sorry. I'm sucking, but I'm having a really fun time at least.\""]
["12:12,000","12:13,000","\"That's the adventure of it.\""]
["12:13,000","12:15,700","\"Oh dear.\""]
["12:15,700","12:18,000","\"You don't want to mess this up. Be careful.\""]
["12:18,000","12:19,800","\"He is going to slide a little when you land.\""]

["12:20,800","12:21,600","\"Oh.\""]
["12:21,600","12:25,800","\"Oh.\""]
["12:25,800","12:27,300","\"I like that sound.\""]

["12:28,000","12:30,500","\"You're so brave for not jumping there.\""]

["12:32,000","12:33,100","\"Hmm.\""]
["12:34,000","12:35,100","\"It is very Genesis.\""]
["12:35,100","12:37,360","\"That sounds like a like a splatterhouse song.\""]
["12:37,360","12:38,520","\"Yeah, I love this.\""]
["12:38,520","12:42,640","\"Whoa, that's cool.\""]
["12:42,640","12:43,240","\"Was this one?\""]
["12:43,240","12:45,280","\"Oh, well, it's gone now.\""]
["12:45,280","12:47,160","\"A game has a lot of stuff.\""]
["12:47,160","12:50,280","\"You're not going to really figure out until you at least do it once, but that's fine.\""]
["12:50,280","12:52,040","\"At least I know now that's cool.\""]
["12:52,040","12:53,960","\"I should have figured it was a nuke.\""]
["12:53,960","12:58,280","\"Oh, because it looks like the like rotating.\""]
["12:58,280","13:00,920","\"Well, because of what the symbol was.\""]
["13:02,800","13:04,800","\"I cannot believe Eggman bought all this shit.\""]
["13:04,800","13:06,400","\"This is a really cool level.\""]
["13:06,400","13:08,700","\"I was hoping there was going to be a hedge maze.\""]
["13:08,700","13:10,900","\"The music is really good here.\""]
["13:10,900","13:12,200","\"It's kind of a hedge maze.\""]

["13:15,400","13:18,800","\"Oh, hey, fire.\""]
["13:18,800","13:20,200","\"So that's what it does.\""]
["13:20,200","13:21,400","\"Yeah, we're doing that earlier.\""]
