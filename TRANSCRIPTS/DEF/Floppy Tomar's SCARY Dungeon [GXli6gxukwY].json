["06:19,700","06:23,800","\"That was a huge waste of time. Why would you do that? What is here?\""]

["06:26,960","06:32,340","\"-What are you taking those out? -If I'm in a bigger mess, I think better.\""]
["06:32,340","06:37,780","\"-I bet you can just open that fucking door. -I'm kind of scatterbrained and surrounding myself with clutter\""]

["09:20,880","09:22,920","\"- You need to find a weapon first probably.\""]
["09:22,920","09:24,880","\"- Yeah, maybe it's the fact that I don't have a weapon\""]
["09:24,880","09:26,440","\"that I can't enter combat.\""]
["09:26,440","09:28,680","\"- I love these graphics.\""]
