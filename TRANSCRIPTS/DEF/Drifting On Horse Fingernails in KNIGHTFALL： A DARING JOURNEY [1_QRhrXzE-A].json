["00:30,880","00:35,600","\"Yeah, make sure you slap every strange horse you meet on the belly.\""]
["00:35,600","00:37,760","\"That's why if you break it, you gotta put it down.\""]
["00:37,760","00:42,080","\"I thought if you break it, then it finally starts listening to you.\""]
["00:42,080","00:43,600","\"If you break it, you buy it.\""]
["00:43,600","00:46,320","\"No, if a horse breaks its leg, you gotta put it down.\""]

["07:51,500","07:57,540","\"Tomar could use the W. I could use the A you could use the S and the D and would work out pretty good\""]
["07:57,540","08:02,240","\"And then you could control the mouse. I could do the left click Tomar could do the the right click\""]
["08:02,240","08:07,660","\"Take shale. I think that that would help a lot. This is it. We're gonna win. We're gonna win. We're gonna win\""]

["08:16,740","08:18,740","\"They're gonna just blow a little horn\""]
["08:20,220","08:22,220","\"It is kind of catchy\""]
["08:22,220","08:29,540","\"What is the point of the flag it seems like all it does is make it easier for other people to spot you\""]
["08:29,540","08:37,100","\"Yeah, that's the whole point. It's like a taunt. Yeah, remember back in the day when newgrounds had a weird little like\""]
["08:37,100","08:40,380","\"War it was like a parody war. Do you remember that? Oh?\""]
["08:40,380","08:45,580","\"You mean we're all taunts was big and they and they made brawl funnies you mean well\""]
["08:45,580","08:49,980","\"It wasn't just it wasn't even just that it was like the Metal Gear collab came out and like the Metacal\""]
["08:49,980","08:52,780","\"He's made like Metal Gear funnies or something like that\""]
["08:52,780","08:57,900","\"It was like a crazy actual war there was even a podcast on the front page talking about it that Rina Chan made\""]
["08:57,900","09:03,180","\"Newgrounds had like a very like weird vibe of like I would say elitism\""]
["09:03,180","09:07,980","\"But like people would just kind of be like oh whatever like you know whatever I'm not doing his shit\""]
["09:07,980","09:12,940","\"And whatever I'm doing is like good. I just thought it was funny. There was like a whole little fucking\""]
["09:13,660","09:17,020","\"There was a bit, well it wasn't little on the website, everyone was talking about it.\""]
["09:17,020","09:20,220","\"Remember when the laziest content on the internet was parodies?\""]
["09:20,220","09:21,180","\"Yes.\""]
["09:21,180","09:24,300","\"I missed a long for that, yeah.\""]
["09:24,300","09:25,500","\"God.\""]

["09:27,100","09:29,500","\"It's true.\""]
["09:29,500","09:33,340","\"But if you really think about it, we are parrying.\""]
["09:33,340","09:34,540","\"I'm finally the pilot.\""]
["09:34,540","09:38,140","\"We are parrying jobs by doing this.\""]
["09:38,140","09:38,460","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:38,460","09:40,460","\"We're what?\""]
["09:40,460","09:41,740","\"We're pirating jobs.\""]
["09:41,740","09:43,740","\"We're hurting jobs.\""]
["09:43,740","09:46,740","\"The parody 401k that we get.\""]
["09:46,740","09:48,740","\"And we're actually quite clever for doing so.\""]
["09:48,740","09:49,740","\"It's actually ironic.\""]
["09:49,740","09:50,740","\"Yeah.\""]
["09:50,740","10:01,740","\"I genuinely would sacrifice my Let's Play job in both of you at the altar and watch your blood fucking go into a room if it meant that like...\""]
["10:01,740","10:07,740","\"like internet content had to be good but it actually made money when it was.\""]
["10:07,740","10:15,540","\"It just just a world like like an internet meritocracy of sorts like a like a place where yeah like a fucking like cartoon or like a\""]
["10:15,540","10:21,540","\"Fucking not going to build something maybe these buildings would be good. I'm always playing never. Oh, yeah\""]
["10:21,540","10:28,380","\"Never mind. I don't think you can there's no door dude. What this game needs is some epic horse chase music\""]
["10:28,540","10:32,560","\"Let's go left ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding dingle ding\""]
["10:32,560","10:34,220","\"all the things\""]

["10:36,480","10:39,860","\"Yeah, and we're we have to fill in for you\""]
["10:39,860","10:46,060","\"You want me to bring it tell me to bring it? I should have to remember to bring it\""]
["10:46,060","10:47,740","\"you\""]
["10:47,740","10:52,560","\"Responsibility mister town nearby here. You're the only one who's allowed to play it is a town down up here on this hill\""]
["10:52,560","10:54,560","\"It sure seems like it I\""]
["10:55,000","11:00,280","\"Haven't figured out exactly how to locate the rose yet and let's those signs point towards it\""]
["11:00,280","11:03,000","\"That would be the yellow flag means low\""]
["11:03,000","11:06,840","\"It's it's like somewhere between like surrendering and peeing\""]
["11:06,840","11:15,440","\"You surrendering, but you're also in decent. So please don't come over. Yeah, exactly. Okay, like it's like I'm in the shower right now\""]
["11:15,440","11:21,840","\"But I might surrender when I'm out. I'm in the shit all songs are basically just using one formula\""]
["11:21,840","11:24,200","\"If you heard one you heard them all\""]
["11:24,200","11:27,560","\"And Gene Simmons from Kiss invented it.\""]
["11:27,560","11:31,200","\"You know, he goes around saying that.\""]
["11:31,200","11:39,200","\"He goes around saying that like every single rock and metal song written after like 1985\""]
["11:39,200","11:42,400","\"was directly inspired by Kiss.\""]
["11:42,400","11:44,400","\"Yeah, I really do.\""]
["11:44,400","11:46,480","\"Yes, he's a piece of shit.\""]
["11:46,480","11:49,120","\"I don't think I feel the same way.\""]
["11:49,120","11:50,120","\"That's really stupid.\""]
["11:50,120","11:52,960","\"I would hate to offend Gene Simmons of Kiss.\""]
["11:52,960","11:54,960","\"It's like a fucking Kim Johnny\""]
["11:54,960","12:02,640","\"I like like two kiss. Oh, yeah, that is like a Kim Kim a Kim J a Kim family lie. Yeah\""]
["12:02,640","12:11,580","\"Not only did the master behind you behind you shoot him shoot him back\""]

["12:15,760","12:19,840","\"Okay, fuck you\""]
["12:20,280","12:27,280","\"Look I saved our lives that guy doesn't even realize it, but I totally saved our lives there going by old jeans logic\""]
["12:27,280","12:34,520","\"Doesn't that mean that every song that came before him inspired him to no no no only he's can I'd spy I think yeah\""]
["12:34,520","12:38,100","\"I think he thinks that he did something original and everybody else which like\""]
["12:38,100","12:43,040","\"Yeah, I like a few kiss songs, but they're not like do not groundbreaking\""]
["12:43,040","12:46,680","\"No, I saw a video of him on the news getting absolutely owned by his wife\""]
["12:46,920","12:51,200","\"I'm not sure if it was fake or not because it was so comically bad. I'm doing shit\""]
["12:51,200","12:56,160","\"It was so comically like stupid and like she was making fun of him fucking people\""]
["12:56,160","13:01,720","\"And maybe it was just like they have a reality show for a little while like the gene family\""]
["13:01,720","13:06,760","\"Because they wish they were Aussie. Yeah, yeah, they really do oh\""]
["13:06,760","13:10,920","\"Poor Aussie his brains converted\""]
["13:11,720","13:13,240","\"To be fair\""]
["13:13,240","13:18,160","\"Like by this point with the amount of drugs that he's done. I'm shocked. He lasted this long\""]
["13:18,160","13:19,720","\"It is pretty amazing\""]
["13:19,720","13:25,440","\"Dude, I saw black Sabbath in concert like two years ago like and granted it was a little geriatric\""]
