["10:55,500","11:02,500","\"I don't know. I never heard anybody talk about it. I don't hear about it much, but anyone I've ever heard talk about it said good things about it.\""]
["11:02,500","11:09,580","\"I was excited to play it when we first play it a lot. Yeah, it's pretty fun. There's some neat mechanics in here, too. Like I\""]
["11:09,580","11:18,100","\"Think the evolution system is kind of neat because you can infinitely just keep improving and upgrading your guys\""]
["11:18,100","11:22,300","\"Yeah, but Pokemon already did that so it's true once you hit level 100\""]
["11:22,300","11:27,720","\"You revert down to level one again, and you can devolve your Pokemon. Yep. Maybe they have something like that\""]

["01:07:27,940","01:07:31,940","\"So it turns out floating in space annihilated the space age, and she's actually okay.\""]
["01:07:31,940","01:07:33,660","\"But when her and Eggman collide...\""]
["01:07:33,660","01:07:35,020","\"I thought she got shy.\""]

["01:07:52,980","01:07:54,940","\"So what's the gameplay mechanic?\""]
["01:07:54,940","01:07:55,940","\"How does this work?\""]

["01:09:56,100","01:10:01,460","\"Shoot zone and did that's the level that's the first level. Yeah, but choose zone\""]
["01:10:01,460","01:10:08,700","\"And then when you finally get to his door he goes hmm you again, huh? Yeah, huh?\""]

["03:06:40,160","03:06:42,360","\"- I remember I was obsessed with it as a kid.\""]

["03:07:01,840","03:07:03,200","\"- For their actual designs.\""]
["03:07:03,200","03:07:05,200","\"- Getting to have it actually on a cartoon obviously\""]
["03:07:05,200","03:07:07,320","\"is way better than just having a tiny little thing\""]
["03:07:07,320","03:07:08,320","\"on a screen. - Yeah.\""]
["03:07:08,320","03:07:12,200","\"It was ninking to see everything come to life because all those designs are really good.\""]
["03:07:12,200","03:07:18,800","\"And the anime ended up turning out pretty well, like considering what it is.\""]
["03:07:18,800","03:07:20,840","\"Could have been really bad.\""]
["03:07:20,840","03:07:22,600","\"Yeah, it could have been absolutely.\""]
["03:07:22,600","03:07:27,040","\"Or just like extremely uninteresting and formulaic like Pokemon.\""]
["03:07:27,040","03:07:31,920","\"I tried to follow it as a kid and I jumped off it pretty early just because it didn't\""]

["03:07:33,800","03:07:35,080","\"It wasn't making progress.\""]
["03:07:35,600","03:07:38,760","\"It's really frustrating how much padding there was in Pokemon.\""]
["03:07:38,760","03:07:42,140","\"- It starts off strong, like it starts off with promise.\""]
["03:07:42,140","03:07:46,480","\"It's not amazing or anything, but it has an okay start.\""]
["03:07:46,480","03:07:48,480","\"- It does, no, 'cause for the first few episodes,\""]
["03:07:48,480","03:07:52,440","\"they must've been either on purpose or accidentally,\""]
["03:07:52,440","03:07:55,920","\"like a change of philosophy when writing those episodes.\""]
["03:07:55,920","03:07:58,400","\"- You know, it's weird with a lot of shows.\""]
["03:07:58,400","03:08:00,760","\"The first episode is one of the weaker ones,\""]
["03:08:00,760","03:08:02,920","\"'cause it's essentially the pilot.\""]
["03:08:02,920","03:08:08,920","\"But with Pokemon, the first episode might be one of the strongest episodes, which is kind of bizarre.\""]
["03:08:08,920","03:08:11,920","\"- Or one Ash's voice is all low and weird in the first episode. - I do.\""]
["03:08:11,920","03:08:13,420","\"- Yeah. - I find it more charming.\""]
["03:08:13,420","03:08:15,920","\"- He calls it a Pokeball. - Pokeball, yeah he does.\""]

["03:08:39,680","03:08:47,040","\"I don't know. Every Digimon like has a bio like you can look into what sort of data they're supposed to be made of.\""]

["03:08:49,040","03:08:52,320","\"Yours he's just like an mp3 file or something. Yeah\""]

["03:09:26,880","03:09:31,400","\"Like I think the anime is what actually let a lot of people know about Digimon\""]

["03:10:41,280","03:10:46,180","\"That's so designs can go all over the place depending on like what year they were designed it\""]
["03:10:46,180","03:10:54,540","\"Some of the more recent ones they're sort of trying to make a certain attack to go back to the original style\""]
["03:10:54,540","03:11:01,100","\"Yeah, but it's still not gross. It's just okay now. It can be a weird object again. Oh, I remember Andrew Mona liked him\""]

["03:32:48,300","03:32:53,880","\"Among us. I also don't think it's unfair to call the meme game because literally the meme is just saying among us now\""]
