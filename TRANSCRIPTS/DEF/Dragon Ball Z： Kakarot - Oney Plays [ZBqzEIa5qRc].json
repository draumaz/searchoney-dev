["09:28,000","09:33,720","\"I have invented getting fish and going home. Does that look a good idea to you go on my son?\""]
["09:35,120","09:38,800","\"Come here you little fish is gotta be a fish. That's what a fish is\""]

["10:20,160","10:23,780","\"I don't understand why they haven't taken the approach of late\""]
["10:23,780","10:26,880","\"You know those Batman games say what you will about them\""]
["10:26,880","10:31,320","\"But at least you can tell that they put some actual thought and care into making them\""]
["10:31,600","10:36,220","\"And then they probably put about as much development as you would into any other AAA game like this\""]
["10:36,220","10:39,480","\"This is very clearly something that they they kind of made this\""]
["10:39,480","10:41,800","\"Yeah, yeah\""]
