["00:11,720","00:13,200","\"It is a great theme song.\""]
["00:13,200","00:14,800","\"You know, it's real fucking good.\""]
["00:14,800","00:18,000","\"The whole soundtrack to that show is real fucking good.\""]
["00:18,000","00:19,000","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:19,000","00:23,680","\"I will say, like, I think on the whole, I like Samurai Champloo better.\""]
["00:23,680","00:26,880","\"But the soundtrack in Bebop is like...\""]
["00:26,880","00:28,880","\"for sure like\""]
["00:28,880","00:30,840","\"Way better to me\""]
["00:30,840","00:34,720","\"You guys have you both seen season one of Jojo?\""]
["00:34,720","00:41,760","\"I started watching it and I was like huh, and I didn't you want to know what happened to me\""]
["00:41,760","00:48,080","\"It's like the opposite of what happens everything else right everyone's always like Jojo's so good after like season like three or whatever\""]
["00:48,080","00:53,660","\"And it starts getting really crazy and everyone loves it blah blah blah blah. I would definitely argue that it finds itself\""]
["00:54,120","01:01,100","\"pacing yeah around season three well when I watch Jojo I watched like season or episode one\""]
["01:01,100","01:04,200","\"I was like this fucking rocks like the count of money crease though\""]
["01:04,200","01:08,460","\"It takes itself really seriously and it's got like really like a good villain and a good like you know\""]
["01:08,460","01:13,340","\"Stakes and whatever and then in the final episode of season one it goes crazy\""]
["01:13,340","01:15,540","\"it like\""]
["01:15,540","01:18,780","\"You know it gets really weird and I was just kind of like oh this sucks\""]
["01:18,780","01:23,920","\"Like it lost all of its stakes is just silly now. Did you ever even watch season two?\""]
["01:23,920","01:27,880","\"No, that that's the point that let's like shoot I know but I\""]
["01:27,880","01:33,240","\"Literally I enjoyed the part that everyone else hated and then when it started getting crazy. That's what everyone else loves\""]
["01:33,240","01:36,680","\"I was like oh, I think you should keep watching it anyway\""]
["01:36,680","01:44,000","\"I probably would like you to get a chance where I feel like you just watch it like it's interesting enough at all times\""]
["01:44,000","01:47,720","\"There's enough going on that you just watch it to see what happens\""]
["01:47,720","01:52,700","\"It doesn't even matter if you love it or not. It just I was being a bitch\""]
["01:53,520","01:58,480","\"Continue in it just because I was like, \"\"And whilst everything I like, I'm gonna start\""]
["01:58,480","02:00,320","\"bugging you to watch season two now.\"\"\""]
["02:00,320","02:01,320","\"I'll watch it.\""]

["02:04,080","02:06,860","\"These fucking cutscenes, dude.\""]
["02:06,860","02:08,960","\"I like them, but now I don't like them.\""]
["02:08,960","02:10,200","\"But I do like them.\""]
["02:10,200","02:11,200","\"It's a good idea.\""]
["02:11,200","02:14,200","\"It is a good idea.\""]
["02:14,200","02:19,840","\"I don't think it works for something like I killed some scorpions and then jumped, but\""]
["02:19,840","02:24,840","\"But I think it works for something that would actually matter.\""]
["02:24,840","02:26,800","\"It's clever, I'll give it that.\""]
["02:26,800","02:29,840","\"But yeah, you know what, I don't really give a fuck about it.\""]
["02:29,840","02:33,720","\"Seeing a guy epically kill these fucking basic enemies that we've killed a million times\""]
["02:33,720","02:36,040","\"in an epic fucking Matrix cut scene.\""]
["02:36,040","02:40,120","\"Well, it's showing you that now he has a...\""]
["02:40,120","02:44,160","\"He can split his scythe into little claw things, I think is...\""]
["02:44,160","02:45,600","\"Gotcha.\""]

["02:46,600","02:52,840","\"I'm just trying to get you amped up to fucking play with these. I'd rather just fucking play with them\""]
["02:52,840","02:55,400","\"Yeah, that would also be a good idea\""]
["02:55,400","02:57,760","\"but\""]
["02:57,760","03:01,420","\"Consider this that they just they just do that\""]
["03:01,420","03:04,400","\"cool\""]
["03:04,400","03:09,600","\"Actually, that's not I kind of I kind of do like that. That's the coolest thing I've ever seen\""]
["03:09,600","03:14,640","\"Right, I would not like to be caught in a room with the that thing\""]
["03:15,480","03:24,940","\"No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, there was this huge ass spider in my bathtub. You fucking kill it? No. No.\""]
["03:24,940","03:31,880","\"I would never. Would you actually never? Are you one of those people that don't kill bugs? No, you know what?\""]
["03:31,880","03:39,900","\"If I feel like the bug is dangerous, then I will, but I would rather try to capture it in a glass and throw it outside.\""]
["03:39,900","03:42,140","\"Yeah, I uh...\""]
["03:42,140","03:48,140","\"It is weird how empathy kind of goes in and out like kind of depending on what you do\""]
["03:48,140","03:55,340","\"Because like I use the like not care at all about about shit like I used to have a fucking rat problem\""]
["03:55,340","03:58,420","\"And I got I got used to killing like\""]
["03:58,420","04:05,940","\"like two to four rats a day, so I got like for how long for like\""]
["04:07,180","04:13,100","\"Four years you're telling me that you killed like upwards of like thousands of rats probably\""]
["04:13,100","04:17,860","\"I didn't know that you told me you killed a rat one time. I didn't know you know\""]
["04:17,860","04:26,300","\"No, it will okay. That's that's why rats are so shit right because they fucking multiply\""]
["04:26,300","04:31,620","\"Yeah, so like if you have like a rat problem like a real rat problem\""]
["04:31,620","04:32,820","\"I don't know, it was that bad.\""]
["04:32,820","04:34,940","\"- They fucking, yeah, they literally,\""]
["04:34,940","04:37,620","\"it'll be like you have to kill them all,\""]
["04:37,620","04:40,460","\"'cause if you don't, then they fucking just,\""]
["04:40,460","04:43,820","\"they come back so strong and they die in the walls\""]
["04:43,820","04:47,180","\"and they fucking, your place of living literally\""]
["04:47,180","04:49,420","\"starts to wreak of death if they die in the walls.\""]
["04:49,420","04:51,180","\"- What was your rent like there?\""]
["04:51,180","04:53,340","\"- It was 600 a month, so not bad.\""]
["04:53,340","04:54,820","\"- Oh, okay.\""]
["04:54,820","04:58,140","\"- Yeah, I mean, that's what you're paying less for.\""]
["04:58,140","04:58,980","\"- Yeah, exactly. - 'Cause having\""]
["04:58,980","04:59,980","\"little rat critters.\""]

["05:09,840","05:12,460","\"What did you do it all the rat bodies?\""]
["05:12,460","05:17,860","\"Throw them in the fucking garbage. You just threw them into the garbage not not like the kitchen garbage\""]
["05:17,860","05:25,300","\"Yeah, I don't know but but my whole my whole thing with that is that like I got so fucking numb\""]
["05:25,300","05:32,380","\"Like like the first time I killed one it I was like not happy about it, but eventually you just stop fucking caring. I'd feel horrible\""]
["05:32,380","05:34,300","\"but\""]
["05:34,300","05:38,940","\"Monica's like you where she doesn't like to kill, but well, I think she just straight up doesn't kill bugs\""]
["05:38,940","05:42,340","\"So I've gotten used to like not killing them\""]
["05:42,340","05:47,060","\"Like now it's like a black widow cuz I feel like that might cause problems, but like\""]
["05:47,060","05:53,020","\"Yeah, I'll kill a bug if I think it's gonna like bite me in in the nighttime or whatever if it was like\""]
["05:53,180","05:57,620","\"Something actually poison us like that. I'd probably still fucking kill it but this spider\""]
["05:57,620","06:02,340","\"I'd never seen anything like it. It was this big fat fucking pointy black bastard\""]
["06:02,340","06:06,980","\"So you actually don't know if this thing could kill you no, but it was big enough where I didn't want to go near it\""]
["06:06,980","06:13,240","\"I was like this guy. Oh, so it wasn't a moral quandary. It was like cowardice. Yeah, it was pure cowardice. Oh, okay\""]
["06:13,240","06:19,260","\"I thought we were gonna have a discussion here about that, but now you're just you're just a fucking pussy\""]
["06:19,260","06:22,260","\"I am a put though when it comes to bugs. I am a pussy. I don't like him\""]
["06:22,260","06:28,780","\"See I never got that with like I never got why you'd be afraid of something that you can just like mash with your thumb\""]
["06:28,780","06:30,620","\"uhhh\""]
["06:30,620","06:36,260","\"I don't like anticipation like the anticipation of if it's gonna bite me or not\""]
["06:36,260","06:40,220","\"It's like if someone's gonna like if you know someone's gonna like shoot a gun\""]
["06:40,220","06:45,220","\"What I don't like is waiting for it, you know, yeah, yeah, no I I\""]
["06:45,220","06:50,820","\"Get that I guess but like also don't like basic pain like getting bit by things\""]
["06:50,820","06:58,360","\"I guess I guess there's no arguing with that, but like I don't know if a spider bite you you don't even feel it half the time\""]
["06:58,360","07:03,380","\"You just wake up and you're like what why do I have this itchy spot? I get bit a lot. Oh, yeah\""]
["07:03,380","07:05,380","\"There's a ton of bugs in my house\""]
["07:05,380","07:07,500","\"You have delicious\""]
["07:07,500","07:13,360","\"Bug flavored blood no I stupidly leave my window open and then mosquitoes fly in and but and spiders\""]
["07:13,360","07:16,960","\"I got bit on my finger and my my fingers rolled up real big\""]
["07:17,860","07:22,400","\"Yeah, and then I sucked the dajuses out and I spat it into wake up for seasoning\""]
["07:22,400","07:28,240","\"That is the most delicious story I've ever heard in my life. Spide their blood seasoning is delicious\""]
["07:28,240","07:34,580","\"Yes, I bet there's some weird shit like that. Well, no, there is there's like you can eat bats and stuff from real life\""]
["07:34,580","07:40,860","\"You can eat bats and stuff, but there's that coffee that they they fucking feed the the raccoons the coffee\""]
["07:40,860","07:45,500","\"Things and then they pick the beans out of their shit really. Yeah, you've never heard of that\""]
["07:45,500","07:51,780","\"I don't think they're actually raccoons. There's some kind of animal that like eats the coffee beans. Come on, Lyle. Say the fucking scientific term\""]
["07:51,780","07:56,660","\"I actually don't know what they are. It's the devious raccoon. It's the devious devious raccoonuses\""]

["08:02,500","08:08,600","\"these coffee beans and then I don't know what fucking psycho figured out how to do this, but\""]
["08:08,600","08:14,360","\"they pick the beans out of their shit because they like pass through their systems and then apparently the coffee is like\""]
["08:14,900","08:22,020","\"Completely sweet like it's not bitter at all. That sounds delicious, dude sure, but it went through something's asshole. Oh\""]
["08:22,020","08:28,060","\"I guess it hung their girlfriend's assholes all the time now. Yeah, but that's girl shit. It's not real shit\""]
["08:28,060","08:32,600","\"It's not animal shit girl shit. I would consider worse why it shouldn't exist\""]
["08:32,600","08:38,040","\"All they eat is the salad and carrots and their own tears when you hit them. Yeah\""]
["08:38,040","08:41,780","\"Sorry babe didn't mean to hit you so hard babe. I just thought you looked hungry\""]

["09:13,020","09:17,000","\"Oh, so we're gonna go down that race's path now, are we?\""]
["09:17,000","09:20,840","\"You telling me genetics are real now, huh?\""]
["09:20,840","09:28,620","\"Yes, you fucking piece of shit. Oh cool another guy of war weapon. Yeah, I got this\""]

["09:37,700","09:41,900","\"I think that's it's supposed to be more of like a tonfah, but yeah\""]
["09:42,300","09:45,500","\"God of words got climbing we got to do also climbing\""]
["09:45,500","09:53,420","\"But we might as well give you his same weapon I told you about the God of War composer story thing, right? No, what's that?\""]
["09:53,420","09:59,080","\"Where when I was like 16 or 17 I made that God of War two theme. Oh, yeah\""]
["09:59,080","10:03,020","\"Yeah, I made that and then he\""]
["10:03,020","10:08,300","\"Sent me an email the composer God award. He was like that was fucking awesome\""]
["10:08,300","10:11,620","\"I want to show this at an award show and then I responded.\""]
["10:11,620","10:12,620","\"I shot my pants.\""]
["10:12,620","10:14,500","\"I was like, oh my fucking god.\""]

["10:18,980","10:21,020","\"But then I guess he just kind of forgot about it\""]
["10:21,020","10:22,260","\"and he didn't respond.\""]
["10:22,260","10:25,660","\"And then for days, I was just like, what do I do?\""]
["10:25,660","10:28,460","\"And then I literally, I literally looked up his number\""]
["10:28,460","10:31,500","\"online and I called him and he answered.\""]
["10:31,500","10:34,260","\"And I was like, hey, up the guy who made the god\""]

["10:46,180","10:50,340","\"fucking like 40 minutes straight and he was the nicest fucking guy ever.\""]
["10:50,340","10:56,420","\"Wow. Yeah, he was really cool. That's like the story about Bob Berg in finding Mel Blank's phone\""]
["10:56,420","11:01,220","\"number and calling him on the phone when he was a kid. I didn't know that. That's cute. But then\""]
["11:01,220","11:08,980","\"he wound up doing a bunch of Melblank voices. Really? Yeah, like I think he's like a guy.\""]
["11:08,980","11:14,660","\"I think he's uh what's it I think he's Porky and like everything's from Space Jam on. Wow.\""]
["11:14,660","11:21,380","\"Did he do that before Melblank died? Yeah, no this was when Bob Bergen was literally like a\""]
["11:21,380","11:27,300","\"little like 13 year old kid I think. Like no no I mean did he start doing like Porky Pig's voice\""]
["11:27,300","11:31,920","\"some stuff like oh I don't think so no place in living right no no no I'm\""]
["11:31,920","11:35,320","\"pretty sure that was all after you died okay so that this is like a like a\""]

["11:40,220","11:43,300","\"there's stories about Mel blank literally like recording fucking\""]
["11:43,300","11:49,180","\"Sylvester and bugs like from his fucking hospital bed that's so scary you\""]
["11:49,180","11:53,300","\"know what's kind of charming about those old Looney Tunes the new a man was\""]
["11:53,300","11:58,220","\"dying as he voiced them? No, if you listen to their voices nearly every single cartoon\""]
["11:58,220","12:03,020","\"there's always like a natural room reverb. It doesn't really sound like they were recorded in a professional studio.\""]
["12:03,020","12:06,580","\"Yeah, I don't think they had the concept of a professional studio.\""]
["12:06,580","12:15,060","\"There's always like a kitchen kind of reverb in them. I bet they just didn't understand like how sound worked like, but it makes\""]
["12:15,060","12:20,140","\"his screaming funnier. You go through all the work of getting rid of it just to put it back in and post.\""]
["12:20,140","12:26,220","\"by the way I've heard that all those like super harsh screams from Tom and Jerry\""]
["12:26,220","12:32,020","\"are actually Joe Hanna from Hanna Barbera and they're perfect\""]
["12:32,020","12:39,060","\"yeah yeah yeah they're they're like the bugs bunny screams and the fucking Tom\""]
["12:39,060","12:43,700","\"screams are some of the most iconic cartoon screams to this day like no one's\""]
["12:43,700","12:48,740","\"really top them they're pretty dang good Tom screams are perfect yeah\""]
["12:48,740","12:56,500","\"those fucking I kind of wish there was a way to buy all the time of juries all in\""]
["12:56,500","13:01,460","\"one big fat pile is there not I've kind of I remember trying to look that up and\""]
["13:01,460","13:05,900","\"I couldn't find anything but maybe as of now there is I don't know it's it's\""]
["13:05,900","13:11,300","\"really weird like we're we're kind of like losing archives of stuff now\""]
["13:11,300","13:17,740","\"especially as formats and things move on it's getting like weird yeah most\""]
["13:17,740","13:22,380","\"Most people are using AI to like remaster things rather than actually do it the proper way\""]
["13:22,380","13:28,620","\"Well the problem I mean there the proper way I think is oftentimes not even an option like\""]
["13:28,620","13:34,140","\"Like most of the film masters and stuff from like old Disney movies like degraded\""]
