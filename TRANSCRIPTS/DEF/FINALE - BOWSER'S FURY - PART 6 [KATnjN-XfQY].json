["00:15,500","00:16,500","\"Did I get ya?\""]
["00:16,500","00:19,500","\"With Fred and Mario's too hard.\""]
["00:19,500","00:22,000","\"Mario's harder and faster.\""]
["00:22,000","00:25,500","\"I know I'm flip-flopping a bit, but uh, this is too hard.\""]
["00:25,500","00:26,500","\"*Chuckles*\""]
["00:26,500","00:31,060","\"I know I might not be the most intellectually consistent Mario player.\""]
["00:31,060","00:36,660","\"Is that a thing under there that were down here?\""]
["00:36,660","00:37,660","\"Oh my god.\""]

["00:47,620","00:48,620","\"There we go.\""]
["00:48,620","00:51,460","\"We did it.\""]
["00:51,460","00:53,460","\"That was actually fun as fuck.\""]
["00:53,460","00:55,460","\"Who's we saw?\""]
["00:55,460","00:59,540","\"You don't mean that\""]
["00:59,540","01:06,500","\"Also that last like those blocks that we found earlier totally late like the fucking last one here\""]
["01:06,500","01:09,260","\"Maybe it's nothing cuz it won't even acknowledge. There's another\""]
["01:09,260","01:12,020","\"Shash kind of magic\""]
["01:12,020","01:13,020","\"Coopas\""]
["01:13,020","01:19,140","\"I'm guessing that and just involves killing some magic coopas. Yeah, well, let's go kill some fucking magic coopas\""]
["01:19,140","01:26,100","\"I can't take this frickin game no more you guys. We're so fucking close though like no we should quit literally with one minute left\""]
["01:26,100","01:31,620","\"Like like right as the final boss right as the final cutscenes playing\""]
["01:31,620","01:36,980","\"Are there guys we won't do different enemies up here? Oh, oh yeah kill these fucks\""]
["01:36,980","01:43,420","\"We've totally been here and they were like different enemies. They just like replaced them with ease. Yeah, so they're I think they they added\""]
["01:43,420","01:49,980","\"New they added new stuff. So we actually probably have like more that we could get yeah\""]
["01:49,980","01:55,240","\"I see that was really well done bless the fury blocks go back to that. Yeah, there's a 100\""]
["01:55,240","01:59,920","\"We'll show up in time. Oh, there's one. There's some over here\""]
["01:59,920","02:06,600","\"That's just the fucking dick it where is he actually yeah\""]
["02:06,600","02:11,640","\"Father stop this\""]
["02:11,640","02:12,640","\"*screams*\""]
["02:12,640","02:13,640","\"Father.\""]
["02:13,640","02:14,640","\"*laughs*\""]
["02:14,640","02:18,140","\"Didn't we- we were at another place with fury blocks.\""]
["02:18,140","02:21,140","\"Yeah, let's see if we can do that or if this will scare them off.\""]
["02:21,140","02:23,740","\"This is gonna make him leave instantly.\""]
["02:23,740","02:24,740","\"That's really annoying.\""]
["02:24,740","02:25,740","\"Yeah, it's terrible.\""]
["02:25,740","02:29,640","\"Ahhh, come on, don't be like that.\""]
["02:29,640","02:30,640","\"Mmm.\""]
["02:30,640","02:33,640","\"Okay, why did they design it this way?\""]
["02:33,640","02:36,540","\"I don't know, there should be a way to like invoke him.\""]
["02:36,540","02:37,540","\"You know, like a way to just like-\""]
["02:37,540","02:43,380","\"There should be a huge button center that you stomp on and a big Mario glove comes up and flips him off\""]
["02:43,380","02:50,420","\"That would be a good idea to just give Mario like like a megaphone like halfway through you talking to the controller\""]
["02:50,420","02:55,380","\"And any noise you make pisses them off\""]
["02:55,380","03:02,580","\"Yeah, this is god damn it like I wish he'd come out now. Yeah, I get that a lot. Let's see\""]
["03:02,580","03:06,580","\"Um, there's something else over on this little island. I guess we could go get it\""]
["03:06,580","03:10,580","\"That is the opposite direction, so it's over here.\""]
["03:10,580","03:16,580","\"Oh! So there is a trick, but it's going to be really annoying if I tell you guys what it is.\""]
["03:16,580","03:18,580","\"What do you mean annoying?\""]
["03:18,580","03:21,580","\"Like, we won't be able to do it, I'm pretty sure.\""]
["03:21,580","03:22,580","\"What is the trick?\""]
["03:22,580","03:26,580","\"Apparently if you have a Bowser amiibo, you can use it to summon him.\""]
["03:26,580","03:30,580","\"Oh fuck that's so fucking stupid.\""]
["03:30,580","03:31,580","\"That's evil.\""]
["03:31,580","03:33,580","\"It is, isn't it?\""]
["03:33,580","03:39,980","\"That's like Ubisoft shit. That's like the bio level up faster pass and you can yeah\""]
["03:39,980","03:43,820","\"No, that's just actually horseshit. I told you guys would like you\""]
["03:43,820","03:49,020","\"There's gonna be people who would defend that to fuck you\""]
["03:49,020","03:52,660","\"Well, I don't think anyone's gonna defense is gonna be like well\""]
["03:52,660","03:55,660","\"I mean bowser does show up basically every 15 minutes\""]
["03:55,660","03:58,580","\"So I mean you could just be a normal patient person\""]
["03:58,580","04:02,540","\"There's two kinds of people people who got 50 minutes to blow out their ass because they're not doing shit\""]
["04:02,540","04:08,380","\"And then there's me I'm fucking working on shit all the fucking time and I don't have time for fucking wait around for Bowser, okay?\""]
["04:08,380","04:12,780","\"I've got eight wipes. I've got 43 kids. Yep. I\""]
["04:12,780","04:17,980","\"All got fucking time for this and I don't feed any of them but God of damn it. I'm hungry\""]
["04:17,980","04:20,580","\"Let's go this way. There's something\""]
["04:20,580","04:22,580","\"Oh\""]
["04:22,580","04:26,460","\"No, that's definitely gonna be fucking collecting those cat heads. I don't want to do that\""]
["04:26,460","04:29,060","\"Let's go. Let's go this way. Oh\""]
["04:29,340","04:34,580","\"Oh no, that's definitely gonna be collecting those fucking cat heads too. Let's see. I guess I guess to the left\""]
["04:34,580","04:37,980","\"Let's let's try to the left. Maybe you're just assuming a lot while\""]
["04:37,980","04:42,820","\"I'm just looking at what's missing and it's almost always collect. I'm actually really confused\""]
["04:42,820","04:46,700","\"Why don't you enjoy collecting the same thing over and over and over come on?\""]
["04:46,700","04:52,880","\"Do I really need to say it do I really need to open these old wounds go on my father was killed\""]
["04:52,880","04:55,620","\"My father\""]
["04:56,260","05:01,780","\"Collected by collecting. Oh my god. It's definitely a fucking Bowser block. Okay, sucks dude\""]
["05:01,780","05:08,400","\"Well first you need to feast on fuzzies guys. I'm just gonna go out and get that fucking Bowser amo feasting on fun fuzzies\""]
["05:08,400","05:16,180","\"Yeah, okay. This isn't I feel if we get the Bowser amo at the very least we'll have a cool new ornament to put on the shelf\""]
["05:16,180","05:17,540","\"You know\""]
["05:17,540","05:22,540","\"That's great logic. I think some of our friends might even see it and say that's actually kind of cool\""]
["05:24,100","05:29,820","\"What makes you think any of our friends will say there's no way I'm gonna berate you for buying that Bowser amiibo\""]
["05:29,820","05:31,100","\"It just looks too cool\""]
["05:31,100","05:32,660","\"And then I'm gonna I'm gonna say well\""]
["05:32,660","05:38,340","\"It's gonna be worth a lot someday because it's an amiibo and you're an idiot hold on fuzzies are these guys, right?\""]
["05:38,340","05:42,820","\"These sting on fuzzies is there like a way to get a Yoshi or something?\""]
["05:42,820","05:45,580","\"Can you pick that guy? Oh?\""]
["05:45,580","05:53,340","\"I think we know it's coming that was obvious because in all previous Mario games running up and touching the plant always works\""]
["05:54,060","05:55,260","\"Yeah, I think so.\""]
["05:55,260","05:56,760","\"That makes sense.\""]
["05:56,760","05:57,960","\"Doesn't it?\""]
["05:57,960","05:58,460","\"No.\""]
["05:58,460","06:01,260","\"Okay.\""]
["06:01,260","06:02,560","\"Why are you being so hard in this game?\""]
["06:02,560","06:03,360","\"It's just Mario.\""]
["06:03,360","06:06,460","\"I've not... I think I've been very amicable in this game today.\""]
["06:06,460","06:10,960","\"I think you've been screaming nonstop, nonstop, nonstop about this game.\""]
["06:10,960","06:12,960","\"And I want it to end.\""]
["06:12,960","06:16,960","\"Nah, you've been actually the least screaming of all this.\""]
["06:16,960","06:19,360","\"It's a game for fucking five year olds, Tomar.\""]
["06:19,360","06:20,860","\"You don't mean that.\""]
["06:20,860","06:22,560","\"We're not supposed to be playing this.\""]
["06:22,560","06:23,260","\"Exactly.\""]
["06:23,260","06:32,620","\"Game for adults with classy taste with a refined palette that was a word I was looking for I was on Nintendo advert\""]
["06:32,620","06:38,700","\"And it was it was a full happy family playing Mario, so I assume all adults are supposed to play Mario\""]
["06:38,700","06:42,940","\"Mario is for all ages\""]
["06:42,940","06:45,900","\"What do you think is the biggest shit Reggie ever took?\""]
["06:45,900","06:51,620","\"It's it's got to be a pretty huge ever everyone has that one life-changing shit\""]
["06:52,260","06:55,640","\"You realize in terms of like Nintendo\""]
["06:55,640","06:59,540","\"Who cares about Nintendo? I want to know about Reggie's fucking feces\""]
["06:59,540","07:06,440","\"Okay, it sounds like he's he's cropping up. He's gonna. I don't want to know about that\""]
["07:06,440","07:09,600","\"You say that but if he offered\""]
["07:09,600","07:20,760","\"You might as well use them what would you find what would you do if your favorite rate might poo poo from from\""]
["07:21,260","07:27,640","\"I hated that website was uh was the Reggie Phil to me himself ready feeking me\""]
["07:27,640","07:30,420","\"Reggie feeking me\""]
["07:30,420","07:34,300","\"This is my biggest her creator of the fikachu\""]
["07:34,300","07:41,480","\"Well done. All right. Hopefully that doesn't make him. Oh, it's gonna make him leave. It's totally gonna make it always make some leave\""]
["07:41,480","07:44,680","\"How did they not think this through?\""]
["07:45,780","07:50,700","\"Maybe the idea is just so that you don't go to every single one and just get that immediately\""]
["07:50,700","07:58,100","\"Apparently the gigabell is doing all sorts of crazy crud the beast's fury is growing too strong. Oh, so he didn't leave there\""]
["07:58,100","07:59,060","\"You go\""]
["07:59,060","08:03,600","\"So you have this is an opportunity to get another one. Where's one that we we haven't gone? Oh?\""]
