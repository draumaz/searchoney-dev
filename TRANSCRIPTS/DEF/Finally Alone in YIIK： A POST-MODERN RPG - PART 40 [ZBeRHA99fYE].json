["12:42,960","12:47,040","\"I'm trying to think because some of these might potentially outdo the current one that you're playing as\""]
["12:47,040","12:49,640","\"This one looks normal\""]
["12:49,640","12:55,360","\"I'll talk to them. Let's see what they say. I was trying to think I made the patch twice\""]

["13:57,580","14:05,100","\"So it's like the first yes, it's very clearly supposed to be a reference of the just the voice actor themselves playing Alex\""]
["14:05,100","14:10,260","\"That's supposed to be like whoa look at that. It's it's getting that meta. It's breaking beyond the game. It's good to see him\""]

["15:59,460","16:03,540","\"Watching it destroy one reality and then the next\""]
["16:03,540","16:06,420","\"Then the next each time\""]
["16:06,860","16:11,740","\"It was as if I lost all my friends again. I thought about what Vela told me about soul survivors\""]
["16:11,740","16:18,220","\"Was I becoming a soul survivor? I was the sole survivor of my reality. Maybe a star creature\""]
["16:18,220","16:22,780","\"It was be a fitting fate both are acceptable desperately had longed for it\""]

["16:36,460","16:49,460","\"Who's our name? What was my name? Oh, no. Alex Eek. I wish I had a little question mark question mark question. Oh, yeah, it's true. What should I happen is a name entry screen should have popped up there.\""]

["17:10,780","17:15,220","\"to give it the respect that it wants. You played the record in the radio tower and\""]
["17:15,220","17:21,940","\"it woke up. But I remember all this. You are summarizing the entire game at the end of\""]
["17:21,940","17:25,280","\"- He's a game, I remember we did all of it.\""]
["17:25,280","17:28,440","\"- I also see what he's trying to make,\""]

["17:32,400","17:34,280","\"- He's trying to remind himself, but--\""]

["17:35,560","17:38,040","\"- You don't have to do it this long.\""]
["17:38,040","17:39,240","\"How about, you know--\""]
["17:39,240","17:41,160","\"- Have the voice clips overlapping\""]
["17:41,160","17:43,960","\"so that it becomes like confusing to hear\""]

["17:45,400","17:48,520","\"Maybe get some details wrong that you can notice.\""]
["17:48,520","17:50,600","\"- You've cut ahead before, you've had moments\""]
["17:50,600","17:52,900","\"where you've just summed up that character's taught.\""]

["17:54,900","17:56,200","\"Do you really have to do this?\""]
["17:56,200","17:58,760","\"- Use really quick flashes of what happened visually.\""]
["17:58,760","18:00,440","\"- Have them blurry so that it's the idea\""]
["18:00,440","18:01,440","\"that he doesn't remember.\""]
["18:01,440","18:03,120","\"- Yes. - There's a lot of ways to do this.\""]
["18:03,120","18:05,040","\"- But it's supposed to make you feel like Alex\""]
["18:05,040","18:06,400","\"'cause he's searching,\""]
