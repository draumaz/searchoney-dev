["[\"10:43,140\",\"10:48,060\",\"\\\"It was all one guy. Are you just saying that now this whole game was made by one guy?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"10:48,060\",\"10:52,040\",\"\\\"That's definitely not true. You could unlock a weapon. Whoa, okay?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"10:52,040\",\"10:58,700\",\"\\\"Hmm now I can get is the bow. I guess I can get the bow. I actually hate the bow, but you could try it\\\"\"]"]

["[\"11:27,660\",\"11:34,660\",\"\\\"Eventually you get like a like a like a knuckle weapon and that turned out to be my favorite. Okay. Yeah that I like that one\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:34,660\",\"11:36,660\",\"\\\"So how long is this game?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:36,660\",\"11:41,060\",\"\\\"As long as you want it to be really gonna say one full run once you're like\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:41,500\",\"11:45,260\",\"\\\"Once you've got it down and usually it takes a bit of building up your character\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:45,260\",\"11:48,500\",\"\\\"But like a full run is never designed to take more than a half hour\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:48,500\",\"11:51,340\",\"\\\"This is really pretty\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:51,340\",\"11:54,300\",\"\\\"Yeah, it's got like a really good art style\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:54,300\",\"12:01,900\",\"\\\"Yeah, they've got all that nice like black shading. So I go out here. Yeah. Yep, and that's where you start\\\"\"]"]

["[\"12:12,740\",\"12:21,220\",\"\\\"Well, thanks Zeus\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:21,220\",\"12:23,780\",\"\\\"I would do the epic one. Yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:23,780\",\"12:29,940\",\"\\\"So that that's just a little bit better than it would usually be oh, so I lost everything because I died\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:29,940\",\"12:32,660\",\"\\\"Yeah, all those powers reset every round. Oh\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:32,660\",\"12:38,780\",\"\\\"That's like the binding of Isaac aspect. What was that it that thing? Oh, no\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:38,780\",\"12:40,340\",\"\\\"No, it's your special.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:40,340\",\"12:41,180\",\"\\\"You're why?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:41,180\",\"12:42,000\",\"\\\"Yeah.\\\"\"]"]

["[\"12:47,180\",\"12:48,100\",\"\\\"Oh, I see.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:48,100\",\"12:49,740\",\"\\\"Now that you have something on your special,\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:49,740\",\"12:52,220\",\"\\\"your special is like disproportionately stronger\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:52,220\",\"12:53,940\",\"\\\"than your regular level of life.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:53,940\",\"12:54,780\",\"\\\"Wow.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:54,780\",\"12:55,300\",\"\\\"OK.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:55,300\",\"12:57,340\",\"\\\"So you'll want to abuse the shit out of it.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:57,340\",\"12:57,700\",\"\\\"Yeah.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:57,700\",\"13:00,620\",\"\\\"So this game is essentially just like,\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:00,620\",\"13:02,140\",\"\\\"you try to less as long as you can.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:02,140\",\"13:04,380\",\"\\\"Yeah, you try to get as powerful as you can in a run\\\"\"]"]

["[\"13:06,100\",\"13:07,940\",\"\\\"So it's essentially like Noida.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:07,940\",\"13:08,700\",\"\\\"Yeah.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:08,700\",\"13:12,980\",\"\\\"It's just I would go Zeus again. Yeah, okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:12,980\",\"13:18,500\",\"\\\"You're gonna make this is like a big like Diablo story kind of a game\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:18,500\",\"13:23,940\",\"\\\"It does have a story it's definitely got a story, but it's much more fun to play than Diablo\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:23,940\",\"13:27,440\",\"\\\"Well in my opinion this kind of combats a lot more fun\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:27,440\",\"13:33,620\",\"\\\"Yeah, no this feels really nice. I would go for the dash. I think I would go for the jolt did oh\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:33,980\",\"13:40,420\",\"\\\"Okay, yeah, that'll make your lightning also add figures them. Yeah, that's like a stun effect cool\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:40,420\",\"13:44,620\",\"\\\"Hades said like I'm trying to get to the surface. That's the whole point of the game\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:44,620\",\"13:50,380\",\"\\\"Yeah, well he says that you're not going to because he thinks you're a little bitch, but I'm not well\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:50,380\",\"13:57,620\",\"\\\"Yeah, prove him wrong. Yeah, so Hades is really the your enemy in this. He's your father and the bad guy wait really\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:57,620\",\"14:01,020\",\"\\\"Yeah, wow these guys are danguses. They are\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:01,980\",\"14:06,400\",\"\\\"And actually the one guy who drew this designed them to be like the biggest dingus\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:06,400\",\"14:13,340\",\"\\\"So the thing on the left gives you another 25 max HP and the thing on the right will upgrade one of your\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:13,340\",\"14:16,100\",\"\\\"spells of which you have I\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:16,100\",\"14:23,060\",\"\\\"Guess - now. I'll just do the HP for now also side note the guy who voices Zagreus your character\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:23,060\",\"14:27,060\",\"\\\"Mm-hmm is the dude who did all the music for the game. Wait really? Yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:27,860\",\"14:32,060\",\"\\\"All the music for all these you just like the sound guy for that company\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:32,060\",\"14:38,540\",\"\\\"I don't know but the fucking soundtracks to this game are goddamn great. Yeah, that's real impressive\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:38,540\",\"14:45,080\",\"\\\"Like I listen to the fucking bastion soundtrack for such a long time Cna got more max health\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:45,080\",\"14:49,940\",\"\\\"So I've got max health, but then when I die don't know the snow money. Don't go to that\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:49,940\",\"14:54,060\",\"\\\"That'll be a waste so if I die I'm gonna lose my max health upgrades forever\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:54,900\",\"15:01,420\",\"\\\"Yes, okay, so everything gets lost but eventually you can upgrade your max health like your base max health up to a hundred\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:01,420\",\"15:06,700\",\"\\\"Gotcha. All right. This is interesting. I like this. I got super into this game\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:06,700\",\"15:11,820\",\"\\\"This is like the first game I've gotten like really into in a while. Yeah, no, I'm on the same page\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:11,820\",\"15:17,800\",\"\\\"I like I want like 40 hours of this game already. Yeah, I'm probably in about the same\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:17,800\",\"15:20,980\",\"\\\"I was doing so well and not getting hit and he hit me three times in a fucking row\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:21,260\",\"15:26,180\",\"\\\"Yeah, just remember that your dash makes you invincible. Okay that thing on the left is money\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:26,180\",\"15:33,260\",\"\\\"Usually that's not super important going for like a god like the one on the right is usually like the best thing to do\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:33,260\",\"15:35,080\",\"\\\"Okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:35,080\",\"15:37,620\",\"\\\"And if you ever see the hammer always go for the hammer\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:37,620\",\"15:43,620\",\"\\\"Why is everyone in the underworld so rude you fucking dickhead\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:43,620\",\"15:48,700\",\"\\\"They're always coming in completely uninvited. Can I get my health back in a play or no?\\\"\"]"]

["[\"15:52,260\",\"15:56,180\",\"\\\"Yes, so you you upgraded yourself in a way where?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:56,180\",\"16:01,860\",\"\\\"If you go through every time you go into a new room you get one health back also\\\"\"]"]

["[\"16:18,940\",\"16:22,100\",\"\\\"Yeah, at least now you're dashed as damage again\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:22,100\",\"16:25,660\",\"\\\"And it's an in-flix the weak status\\\"\"]"]
