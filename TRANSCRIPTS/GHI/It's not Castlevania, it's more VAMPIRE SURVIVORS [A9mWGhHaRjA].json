["00:11,920","00:15,920","\"Yeah, I was in Ireland. I just didn't say how do you know I was getting a background waving.\""]
["00:15,920","00:22,480","\"But anyways, uh, went to a theme park that's like close by where I live in Ireland.\""]

["00:28,000","00:31,680","\"I've been going there since I was a kid, but I hadn't been there in about 10 years.\""]
["00:31,680","00:34,800","\"So, last time I was there was prob- no longer than that.\""]
["00:34,800","00:36,800","\"It's been about 20 years since I was last there.\""]
["00:36,800","00:40,880","\"So, it's this place in Waterford culture more, right?\""]

["00:48,320","00:50,560","\"It's just a little tiny theme park, right?\""]
["00:50,560","00:51,440","\"Well, it's not even the theme park.\""]
["00:51,440","00:53,680","\"You just walk in and you pay money to get on each ride.\""]
["00:53,680","00:54,320","\"That's how it works.\""]
["00:54,320","00:56,960","\"You walk to a ride and you pay money, right?\""]
["00:56,960","01:04,280","\"But um, I went with my little cousin and then every single ride we got on it like physically like beat the shit out of me\""]
["01:04,280","01:10,820","\"Like like it hurts so fucking bad just sitting on each ride like like you know\""]
["01:10,820","01:15,560","\"Those things where it's just like a row of seats and then it's attached to a big thing that just spins around over and over\""]
["01:15,560","01:15,960","\"Oh, yeah\""]
["01:15,960","01:18,640","\"Like you go up and you pay like four euro to get on it\""]
["01:18,640","01:24,160","\"And then you sit on it and then all the people like it like getting you locked in or like pissed off like like\""]
["01:24,560","01:30,240","\"Like mean people yeah, they're all super mean you have to hate your job for living in this theme park from the 1980s\""]
["01:30,240","01:32,340","\"Yes, like like they have to do this\""]
["01:32,340","01:36,420","\"horrible job of just securing people for like the entire summer and it was like a heat wave\""]
["01:36,420","01:42,340","\"So I don't blame them right yeah, but as soon as soon as the ride starts. It's like it's too much\""]
["01:42,340","01:45,380","\"It's like too violent right and they don't strap you in properly\""]
["01:45,380","01:49,940","\"So I was like literally shaking from one end of the seat to the other like like like back and forth\""]
["01:49,940","01:54,880","\"And it was beating the ever-loving shit out of me and after the first two rides\""]
["01:54,880","01:58,240","\"I was like I don't think I can do this like I didn't think it was actually gonna\""]
["01:58,240","02:00,760","\"Were there any roller coasters like wooden roller coasters?\""]
["02:00,760","02:06,480","\"There was no roller coasters the biggest scariest ride was this thing that like goes fucking 200 feet up in the air and spins around really hard\""]
["02:06,480","02:09,880","\"That's horrifying, but man after one of these rides I like threw out my bag\""]
["02:09,880","02:16,440","\"Mince Corey it's Corey time. This is the perfect game for being a in a call\""]
["02:16,440","02:21,140","\"I'm an idiot Cory when your accountant calls you talks about taxes and credit you just play this game\""]
["02:21,140","02:27,580","\"Genuinely like I do not give a shit about like account or money or any of that stuff because like I live certainly\""]
["02:27,580","02:29,580","\"Can't stop talking to my pants\""]

["02:39,800","02:43,000","\"Yeah, I don't know\""]
["02:43,000","02:47,980","\"I think it's fly by the seat of your pants, but I guess that's a choreism and showing its fall\""]
["02:47,980","02:53,500","\"I can't help it. You know what I meant. Yeah, I did. I did so what was I talking about? I don't know\""]

["02:56,160","03:00,720","\"Sorry quit. I know you just started. Yeah, do it a different level do different levels to show the\""]
["03:00,720","03:08,400","\"Bands options. You don't want to see green forest. They want to see red Cory. I'm gonna go the second stage again\""]
["03:08,400","03:13,120","\"my ass beat. I know that's fine. No, it's not. It is fine. Just let's let's show the\""]
["03:13,120","03:18,560","\"view. It's fine for me. Just die. This is not sponsored by the way. We just like to get\""]
["03:18,560","03:24,240","\"this game's $2. Yeah, it's $2. Go play it. It's really good. And even Lyle said it was\""]
["03:24,240","03:29,400","\"really good. Yes, and you know it's good. I go. It's everything. Whoa. Neither of those\""]
["03:29,400","03:35,560","\"things are true. While you're a consumer, you play every game and enjoy it. And it pisses\""]
["03:35,560","03:37,560","\"me off\""]
["03:37,560","03:44,560","\"We don't know last night. I don't I don't enjoy every game. I just enjoy every game you don't\""]
["03:44,560","03:50,160","\"Well, I've been over this. I was just kidding. I was making a joke and out you've made me look like a real shit\""]
["03:50,160","03:52,440","\"Wait guys\""]
["03:52,440","03:55,960","\"You mean the two or do you mean like the remake second?\""]
["03:55,960","04:01,440","\"Last of us second one cares about that the first one no I wasn't talking about last of us\""]
["04:01,440","04:06,160","\"Yeah, the new one the remake. It's I don't know why that fucking game even needs to exist\""]
["04:06,160","04:12,020","\"But I'll probably I had no idea the game was already on the ps3 and that could what that's what it came out on\""]
["04:12,020","04:16,120","\"No, no, I mean like the ps4. Yeah, that's what I meant\""]
["04:16,120","04:18,600","\"Like I had no idea. It was already out\""]
["04:18,600","04:23,040","\"Because like when you see it on the ps3 like holy shit the quality of it's like completely different\""]
["04:23,040","04:25,040","\"But the ps4 one looks fine\""]
["04:25,040","04:30,940","\"Yeah, my theory on that is that they just grabbed a bunch of assets from the last of us too and put them back in the last\""]
["04:30,940","04:36,180","\"What they did and and they really the models of it like you know what they're trying to do is erase\""]
["04:36,180","04:40,500","\"It's not worth memory of two that's such they are so shitty it is shitty\""]
["04:40,500","04:47,860","\"They should be charging $30 for that. Yeah, anyways. I'm not interested in those kinds of supporting these shitty fucking developers\""]
["04:47,860","04:54,020","\"Another thing too is like you hear about like a new matting coming out and it's like everyone's like this game sucks\""]
["04:54,020","04:57,580","\"It's like stop buying it like why does everyone buy these fucking games?\""]
["04:57,580","05:02,240","\"I know this is going on deaf ears because everyone who watches the shit does not play the new Madden\""]
["05:02,240","05:06,720","\"Every time these games come out. They're always an abject failure and like there's always\""]
["05:06,720","05:17,360","\"I mean like an audience everyone hates it people on Twitter are always like these games are glitchy and they're showing like screenshots of how\""]
["05:17,360","05:21,620","\"There's literal assets from like 2009 or some shit. I mean it doesn't matter\""]
["05:21,620","05:22,840","\"There was one\""]
["05:22,840","05:25,820","\"There was one on the Wii where straight up\""]
["05:25,820","05:30,560","\"They just released the same game two years in a row and they didn't even like change\""]
["05:30,560","05:37,480","\"So they did in the new one like like it literally said like it was like Madden like oh nine or something\""]
["05:37,480","05:45,260","\"The splash the splash at the start said mad no eight still like\""]
["05:49,360","05:50,840","\"I commend that actually.\""]
["05:50,840","05:52,000","\"Yeah, it takes some balls to win.\""]
["05:52,000","05:52,840","\"If you're gonna let people have it,\""]
["05:52,840","05:54,600","\"at least be honest about it.\""]
["05:54,600","05:56,040","\"Yeah, at least you know what you're getting.\""]
["05:56,040","05:57,520","\"Ugh.\""]

["06:41,320","06:44,320","\"That's what I'm saying. All these animators they can't move their hands.\""]

["06:55,920","07:02,440","\"What I like about the game is that the I don't think the waves change depending on what level you are\""]
["07:02,440","07:07,440","\"It's all just on a timer so you really have to like hustle and like move. Yeah, you have to upgrade it's garlic\""]
