["03:29,560","03:34,840","\"But considering how detailed the levels are I don't really I don't really think that's a bad thing\""]
["03:34,840","03:40,840","\"I see people really seem to hate episodic content, but I don't really mind\""]
["03:41,400","03:47,960","\"It's that delayed gratification. It's like waiting for a TV show or something. Look at this\""]

["05:05,920","05:11,360","\"I feel like if you don't kill somebody while driving a race car, it's a failed mission.\""]

["06:28,240","06:30,240","\"I\""]
["06:30,240","06:37,200","\"Will say I do think one of the things that silly in this game is you could just steal shit from people and that they don't do anything\""]
["06:37,200","06:42,000","\"Would you rather than that they react to it? I actually don't know what I would prefer. I just know it's weird\""]

["07:09,540","07:14,300","\"Got my little briefcase we're treating my little lock pick\""]
["07:14,300","07:20,940","\"So you can pretty much choose a different place every time you replay and like succeed. It'll give you a new place to unlock\""]
["07:22,580","07:27,520","\"Okay, so some fancy cars down here. You think any of them could take to the track\""]
["07:27,520","07:30,300","\"You actually can't get in any cars. Oh\""]
["07:30,300","07:37,660","\"Don't worry. Don't worry Tomar things about to get real. This is security right here. There's two bastards right there\""]

["08:08,540","08:09,540","\"Oh my god.\""]
["08:09,540","08:11,540","\"Where are you going to stash his body?\""]
["08:11,540","08:12,540","\"Let's see.\""]
["08:12,540","08:14,540","\"I got his gun.\""]
["08:14,540","08:17,540","\"I got his card.\""]
["08:17,540","08:18,540","\"And now we got to be careful.\""]
["08:18,540","08:20,540","\"We don't get seen by the other guys.\""]
["08:20,540","08:22,540","\"So I got to open the store with that card.\""]
["08:22,540","08:26,540","\"Gimme this.\""]
["08:26,540","08:31,540","\"I don't think they'll find him here.\""]
["08:31,540","08:35,540","\"I'm just dragging a stroller.\""]
["08:35,540","08:38,540","\"Can you chop this guy up into little cubes?\""]
["08:38,540","08:40,540","\"You are supposed to hide their bodies.\""]
["08:40,540","08:42,540","\"So let's just be careful here real quick.\""]
["08:42,540","08:44,540","\"There's a guy here.\""]
["08:44,540","08:48,540","\"So if a guy has a white dot over his head, it means that\""]
["08:48,540","08:56,020","\"If he sees he's asleep right now, but if he was awake, he would be suspicious of me right because he knows the other guards exactly\""]
["08:56,020","09:01,060","\"Right, you should have the head right now. What's gonna happen? You should have the head. No one will see a little silence pistol\""]
["09:01,060","09:02,580","\"Let's do it\""]
["09:02,580","09:04,580","\"You dip shit\""]

["09:06,860","09:11,500","\"Say about that night night. Bye bye. So now this is what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to go\""]
["09:11,500","09:17,420","\"Stick him in the locker. Yeah, how many bodies does it let you put in one locker - nice\""]
["09:18,340","09:22,740","\"Yeah, there's plenty of room for another but another dude good night you fucking idiot also\""]
["09:22,740","09:25,380","\"No more cameras. Yes\""]
["09:25,380","09:28,340","\"Are you hacking the name frame?\""]
["09:28,340","09:30,340","\"recording erased 50 exp\""]
["09:30,340","09:35,060","\"Now let's get this little fella\""]
["09:35,060","09:41,060","\"Huh don't mind me see that those guys would be suspicious of me. They know me too. Oh\""]
["09:41,060","09:47,300","\"They saw you as a cowboy a second ago exactly. I think it's actually just cuz they know the other security guards\""]
["09:47,860","09:52,420","\"Like there's like two of them. Yeah, let's just dump this little fell in here. Oh sleeping\""]
["09:52,420","09:55,940","\"Good night, baby\""]
["09:55,940","10:02,020","\"And you can use your uh your spider sense to look for items in a room, but there's nothing in here other than some water\""]
["10:02,020","10:05,780","\"You can overflow water and people will go what the fuck wait a minute?\""]
["10:05,780","10:07,940","\"Uh\""]
["10:07,940","10:10,020","\"So i'm in the building with her dad right now\""]
["10:10,020","10:13,220","\"Who's better to kill first the racer or the dad?\""]
["10:13,700","10:18,420","\"I think the racer, uh, there's like, wouldn't more people notice if you killed the famous racer though?\""]
["10:18,420","10:22,980","\"You would think, see that's another silly thing that I actually don't like is that\""]
["10:22,980","10:28,340","\"you would think that if you kill the first target everything would go on super lockdown for the next, but that it doesn't happen.\""]
["10:28,340","10:33,540","\"Right. Yeah, they should put priority of whatever the other. Yeah. I mean, I, you know, I, you know, I will.\""]
["10:33,540","10:37,540","\"Like, it's just because it's an earlier level. No, but also if people don't think it's-\""]
["10:37,540","10:41,060","\"If they make it, if they make it ordered, it makes it less kind of free to do what you want to do.\""]
["10:41,060","10:44,340","\"If it's you have to do it in a certain order. Yeah, you're right. I make sense\""]
["10:44,340","10:48,580","\"It takes it takes a lot of fun out of like an open-ish game like this fucking thing\""]
["10:48,580","10:50,940","\"What is that?\""]
["10:50,940","10:52,940","\"Hello, can you like punch that person a jaw\""]
["10:52,940","10:55,820","\"What's a favor?\""]
["10:55,820","11:02,260","\"This is fucking scary check if your keys are over there. It's huge for me. Let me know is\""]
["11:02,260","11:10,520","\"You should get his keys and then not give them back. Oh that guy's a little thief the guy stole his mascot outfit\""]
["11:10,520","11:12,160","\"- Did he really help him?\""]
["11:12,160","11:13,160","\"- I guess so, we'll see.\""]
["11:13,160","11:14,840","\"- Well, it seems like at the very least\""]
["11:14,840","11:17,120","\"he'll create a bit of a distraction for you.\""]
["11:17,120","11:19,360","\"- And these guys also the Patsy, I think.\""]
["11:19,360","11:21,400","\"- Did you find some keys out there?\""]
["11:21,400","11:23,240","\"- Yeah, I think the murder is going to be\""]
["11:23,240","11:24,400","\"played by this flamingo.\""]
["11:24,400","11:25,720","\"- Thank you.\""]
["11:25,720","11:26,800","\"- See, this is the cool thing.\""]
["11:26,800","11:29,440","\"You can stumble upon like story missions like this\""]
["11:29,440","11:33,160","\"and now I'm wrapped up in this guy's story.\""]
["11:33,160","11:36,560","\"So I can just like, I can just stalk him for a bit.\""]
["11:36,560","11:38,160","\"- You could actually kill this guy if you really wanted to\""]
["11:38,160","11:39,240","\"if you don't really feel thirsty.\""]
["11:39,240","11:40,080","\"- There's literally--\""]
["11:40,080","11:45,920","\"could become the mascot and run right out on the track. Oh no! Why did you do that?\""]
["11:45,920","11:52,160","\"The flamingo is dead. He's up to no good. Oh I'm gonna miss him. The flamingo? Yeah. Don't worry dude.\""]
["11:52,160","11:56,720","\"We can change the flamingo? I don't think I think people will be suspicious of the flamingo as a\""]
["11:56,720","12:01,760","\"shotgun on his back though. That's a good point. Oh yeah look in the bottom right. See the way the\""]
["12:01,760","12:08,080","\"shotgun has a little exclamation over it? Yeah. Yeah. It changed into that because I'm the flamingo\""]
["12:08,080","12:13,080","\"So that lets you know if you're carrying an object that'll make people suspicious.\""]
["12:13,080","12:15,080","\"Because you're in it, yeah, people will see your gun now you're saying.\""]
["12:15,080","12:19,080","\"And now I'm trespassing because I'm a flamingo in the security room.\""]
["12:19,080","12:21,080","\"I'm just gonna leave this guy here.\""]
["12:21,080","12:23,080","\"I don't have any more room.\""]
["12:23,080","12:24,080","\"Anyway, I'm gonna drop this gun.\""]
["12:24,080","12:27,080","\"That's a really bad idea.\""]
["12:27,080","12:29,080","\"Goodbye.\""]
["12:29,080","12:31,080","\"Okay, so we're trespassing, trespassing.\""]

["03:49:04,400","03:49:10,840","\"I don't I'm pretty sure that they like they can see through a curtain because of like a curtains hit box would be really weird\""]
