["01:15,480","01:19,560","\"It's kind of whatever, but I want to start with this mission because this is where the actual game starts\""]

["02:11,920","02:14,920","\"and contain the damage they may inflict on Providence.\""]
["02:14,920","02:17,920","\"I will leave to the men.\""]
["02:21,920","02:29,820","\"Yeah, killing some millionaire some billionaire. Oh, yes, please I swear to God this whole game is basically just kill the elites\""]

["03:28,580","03:34,740","\"Was it like well well received? I'm pretty sure everyone got mad at it because it was released episodically\""]

["03:39,900","03:45,880","\"I see people really seem to hate episodic content, but I don't really mind\""]
["03:46,420","03:52,980","\"It's that delayed gratification. It's like waiting for a TV show or something. Look at this\""]
["03:52,980","03:59,620","\"Welcome to Miami\""]
["03:59,620","04:05,300","\"The innovation race is on its last day and it is down to the wire\""]

["04:46,380","04:49,980","\"The stakes are as high as they can.\""]
["04:49,980","05:10,980","\"Now in the game, baby.\""]
["05:10,980","05:16,400","\"I feel like if you don't kill somebody while driving a race car, it's a failed mission.\""]
["05:16,400","05:17,400","\"I agree.\""]
["05:17,400","05:19,400","\"There's lots of ways.\""]
["05:19,400","05:20,400","\"No.\""]

["05:45,840","05:46,680","\"So okay, so.\""]
["05:46,680","05:49,120","\"- It's not suspicious at all that you refuse the frisk.\""]
["05:49,120","05:51,680","\"- Can't point me the one's away when I'm off the frisk.\""]
["05:51,680","05:53,240","\"(laughing)\""]
["05:53,240","05:54,760","\"- Okay, so here's the thing, right?\""]
["05:54,760","05:56,160","\"There's a button you can hold down.\""]
["05:56,160","05:58,440","\"That's pretty much just like spider sense.\""]

["06:00,920","06:02,600","\"- I know I used it in the first one.\""]
["06:02,600","06:03,600","\"- What's that red dot?\""]
["06:03,600","06:05,960","\"- That is one of my targets, that's Sierra Knox, right?\""]
["06:05,960","06:06,800","\"- Okay, interesting.\""]
["06:06,800","06:08,120","\"- And her daddy's up there in that building.\""]

["06:11,600","06:16,240","\"But let me just show you what kind of stuff you can get up to\""]
["06:16,240","06:18,840","\"I'll go down here\""]
["06:18,840","06:25,300","\"There's a dipshit. Well subway station people like I set up with just an underground tunnel. You'd subdue him\""]
["06:25,300","06:28,240","\"Follow the fish\""]
["06:28,240","06:30,680","\"There's a little busker down here\""]
["06:30,680","06:33,240","\"You take his coin\""]
["06:35,400","06:42,040","\"I will say I do think one of the things that silly in this game is you could just steal shit from people and that they don't do anything\""]
["06:42,040","06:48,100","\"Would you rather than that they react to it? I actually don't know what I would prefer. I just know it's weird. It's funny\""]
["06:48,100","06:55,420","\"It's a stupid little extra thing they added you here. Okay, so this is right here caught on camera. Oh, that's no good\""]
["06:55,420","07:01,400","\"You know what evidence you destroy the the tapes. Oh, isn't that a thing you can do. Yeah, you can\""]
["07:01,400","07:04,380","\"So we're gonna go down this parking lot right here\""]
["07:04,380","07:08,940","\"So remember when we were planning we smuggled something in?\""]
["07:08,940","07:10,940","\"Oh I remember it's right here.\""]
["07:10,940","07:12,940","\"Right now.\""]

["07:16,540","07:18,140","\"Got my little briefcase.\""]
["07:18,140","07:19,940","\"We retrieved my little log pick.\""]
["07:19,940","07:22,620","\"So you can pretty much choose a different place.\""]
["07:22,620","07:24,580","\"Every time you replay and like succeed,\""]
["07:24,580","07:27,660","\"it'll give you a new place to unlock.\""]
["07:27,660","07:28,820","\"OK, so--\""]
["07:28,820","07:30,940","\"Some fancy cars down here.\""]
["07:30,940","07:33,660","\"You think any of them could take to the track?\""]
["07:33,660","07:35,660","\"You actually can't get in any cars.\""]
["07:35,660","07:38,180","\"Oh, don't worry, don't worry, Tomar.\""]
["07:38,180","07:39,860","\"Things about to get real.\""]
["07:39,860","07:41,620","\"This is security right here.\""]
["07:41,620","07:43,140","\"There's two bastards right there.\""]
["07:43,140","07:46,860","\"I'm gonna turn off his fuse box like a bastard.\""]
["07:46,860","07:49,740","\"I did him with his sneeze.\""]
["07:49,740","07:53,220","\"So you can see that little sim in there walking around.\""]
["07:53,220","07:54,060","\"He's like, what the fuck?\""]
["07:54,060","07:55,220","\"- You're that little sound.\""]
["07:55,220","07:56,460","\"- He sure did.\""]
["07:56,460","07:59,020","\"So I got my gun and I got my fiber wire.\""]
["07:59,020","08:01,380","\"Come on out, little pretty boy.\""]
["08:01,380","08:02,980","\"- Come on out, boy.\""]

["08:16,020","08:20,420","\"Ah, let's see. I got his uh, his gun. I got his...\""]
["08:20,420","08:24,980","\"His card. And now we gotta be careful. We don't get seen by the other guys.\""]
["08:24,980","08:27,780","\"So I gotta open the store with that card.\""]
["08:27,780","08:32,180","\"Gimme this.\""]
["08:32,580","08:34,880","\"(laughs)\""]
["08:34,880","08:36,920","\"Ah, I don't think they'll find him here.\""]
["08:36,920","08:41,240","\"- Oh, I'm just dragging a stroller.\""]
["08:41,240","08:43,880","\"- Can you chop this guy up into little cubes?\""]
["08:43,880","08:45,560","\"- You are supposed to hide their bodies.\""]
["08:45,560","08:48,520","\"So let's just be careful here real quick.\""]
["08:48,520","08:50,280","\"There's a guy here.\""]
["08:50,280","08:52,760","\"Okay, so if a guy has a white dot over his head,\""]
["08:52,760","08:55,640","\"it means that he's asleep right now,\""]
["08:55,640","08:57,960","\"but if he was awake, he would be suspicious of me.\""]
["08:57,960","09:00,280","\"- Right, 'cause he knows that he's supposed to be on the guard.\""]
["09:00,280","09:01,520","\"- Exactly, right?\""]
["09:01,520","09:02,480","\"- Can you shoot him in the head right now?\""]
["09:02,480","09:04,000","\"What's gonna happen if you shoot with a head?\""]
["09:04,000","09:04,840","\"No one will see.\""]
["09:04,840","09:06,520","\"With a little silence pistol.\""]

["09:14,640","09:16,000","\"So now this is what you're supposed to do.\""]
["09:16,000","09:16,840","\"You're supposed to go,\""]
["09:16,840","09:17,680","\"(mumbles)\""]

["09:46,780","09:47,840","\"-Oh, they saw you as a cowboy.\""]
["09:47,840","09:48,500","\"Is that going to go?\""]
["09:48,500","09:49,900","\"-Exactly.\""]
["09:49,900","09:51,300","\"I think it's actually just because they know\""]
["09:51,300","09:52,700","\"the other security guards.\""]
["09:52,700","09:53,780","\"-Yeah, because there's only two of them.\""]
["09:53,780","09:55,020","\"There's a bunch.\""]

["10:00,900","10:06,980","\"And you can use your uh, your spider sense to look for items in a room. There's nothing in here other than some water\""]
["10:06,980","10:11,000","\"You can overflow water and people will go what the fuck wait a minute, so\""]
["10:11,000","10:15,020","\"So I'm in the building with her dad right now\""]
["10:15,020","10:19,580","\"Who's better to kill first the racer or the dad? I think the racer\""]
["10:19,580","10:23,460","\"I feel like wouldn't more people notice if you killed the famous racer though\""]
["10:23,460","10:29,480","\"You would think see that's another silly thing that I actually don't like is that you would think that if you kill the first\""]
["10:29,480","10:34,300","\"Target everything would go on super lockdown for the next but that it doesn't happen right yeah\""]
["10:34,300","10:36,500","\"They should put priority of whatever the other yeah\""]

["11:56,840","12:02,780","\"What is I don't think I think people will be suspicious of the flamingo as a shotgun on his back\""]
["12:02,780","12:10,740","\"That's a good point. Oh, yeah, look in the bottom right see the way the shotgun has a little exclamation over it. Yeah, it changed into that because\""]

["15:22,820","15:27,340","\"What I would call a very linear open-world game, but it's like I think that's the good combination\""]
["15:27,340","15:31,020","\"It's like it kind of let you do what you want to do, but also you there's a clear idea\""]
["15:31,020","15:36,460","\"There's lots of different ways you can do things in a nice contained tightly designed area\""]

["16:27,880","16:32,800","\"Master Mode these markers wouldn't appear. Right. And I'm generally against\""]
["16:32,800","16:38,500","\"Waypoint markers but I think for the first time you play it's fine. Yeah\""]
["16:38,500","16:42,700","\"because again there's also stuff to do in between. Yeah let's show the documents\""]
