["03:48,980","04:08,260","\"When you're growing up, do you remember how your church had like a little jail for evil witches?\""]
["04:08,260","04:13,940","\"Full of them. Did your church believe in witches, Chris?\""]
["04:13,940","04:17,300","\"Uh, you actually went, right?\""]

["04:18,300","04:20,340","\"Did they believe in witches?\""]
["04:20,340","04:22,940","\"No, I never heard anyone say witches.\""]

["04:28,140","04:30,140","\"Not even on a hot summer's day.\""]
["04:30,140","04:32,740","\"Not even so you could start like an echo on the pavement.\""]
["04:32,740","04:36,380","\"So I take it there were never any witches in your church's witch jail.\""]
["04:36,380","04:40,260","\"No, the only thing I really remember from church is that all the older women used to\""]
["04:40,260","04:42,860","\"have drama because they'd all look around at each other.\""]
["04:42,860","04:45,300","\"And that was literally what caused the drama.\""]
["04:45,300","04:46,780","\"They look around at each other?\""]
["04:46,780","04:50,540","\"Yeah, like one woman would look around and keep looking around and the other woman would\""]
["04:50,540","04:52,780","\"be like, \"\"Oh she's ridiculous isn't she?\""]
["04:52,780","04:54,620","\"She's always just looking around.\"\"\""]
["04:54,620","04:58,540","\"That's what we really remember.\""]
["04:58,540","05:02,300","\"You gotta lead an exciting life.\""]
["05:02,300","05:04,060","\"Nobody paid attention in church though.\""]
["05:04,060","05:08,580","\"Everyone just like zoned out the second the priest started because he was so boring.\""]
["05:08,580","05:12,300","\"That's what the Simpsons taught me church is like for everybody.\""]
["05:12,300","05:17,100","\"The only other church memory I have is one time at the end of church, the priest said\""]
["05:17,100","05:21,900","\"something like, \"\"And congratulations to the people who raised the money for bla bla bla.\"\"\""]
["05:21,900","05:24,520","\"And then the organist just went fucking crazy for no reason.\""]
["05:24,520","05:27,120","\"Went like, \"\"D Bill do do do do do do do it!\"\"\""]
["05:27,120","05:28,300","\"And it was just like, \"\"What the fuck?\"\"\""]
["05:28,300","05:31,260","\"And everyone's like looking around all confused.\""]
["05:31,260","05:34,240","\"So you're saying your church organist had a hidden power?\""]
["05:34,240","05:35,240","\"Delight!\""]

["05:45,180","05:50,060","\"I think the guy he probably wanted to do like something like that is like concert organ\""]
["05:50,060","05:54,780","\"playing stuff and like the best gig he could get was his church so he was like dying for\""]
["05:54,780","05:57,380","\"an opportunity to do anything but Psalms.\""]

["14:21,220","14:23,420","\"Yeah, yeah, don't have the shotgun enabled\""]
["14:23,420","14:29,160","\"But I mean even something like like Street Fighter has like you can like spam sure you can and get pretty far like even\""]
["14:29,160","14:34,020","\"Even with people that kind of know what they're doing. Yeah, I was gonna say I've always been a better\""]
["14:34,020","14:38,180","\"Ken button masher than any other player like played straight\""]
["14:38,180","14:41,460","\"That's just how I am with those games. Oh\""]
["14:41,460","14:47,500","\"Look at him. You should point your mic get your throat so that you get a deep bassie sound like oh, yeah\""]
["14:47,500","14:50,740","\"You can do that. I always blows my mind that you just hold a mic right up here\""]
["14:50,740","14:55,420","\"You know what they did with Don LaFontaine apparently they had they'd have a shotgun\""]
["14:55,420","14:57,740","\"Boided like straight down in his throat\""]
["14:57,740","15:01,460","\"Yeah, and then they'd have and then they'd have like a u87 in front of his mouth\""]
["15:01,460","15:04,740","\"Oh, that's really genius and it's made so they'd use like both\""]
["15:04,740","15:07,540","\"Like the complimentary sounds of each\""]
["15:07,540","15:13,340","\"He was the movie trailer voice guy. Yeah, like the original like in a world guy\""]
["15:14,060","15:20,200","\"Now did he was that his technique that he would if you hired him tell you about or did just everyone know how to do that\""]
["15:20,200","15:24,080","\"I think that was his like technique like this something that he and whatever engineers\""]
["15:24,080","15:29,340","\"He worked with like worked out was the best possible way to present his voice. That's really cool\""]
["15:29,340","15:32,200","\"What if I point the mic in my eyeballs?\""]
["15:32,200","15:36,000","\"What if I point it right at my legs\""]
["15:36,000","15:40,580","\"What do those sound like what if I cross between my thighs to over?\""]
["15:40,580","15:43,440","\"What if I put a microphone on each knee?\""]
["15:43,440","15:47,620","\"And as I say words I pump my legs up towards my face\""]
["15:47,620","15:51,140","\"Think you should try that. Let me know I'd go\""]
["15:51,140","15:54,220","\"I like that a fact honestly\""]
["15:54,220","16:00,820","\"It is it is kind of neat. I'm glad that they went with something like that and not like\""]
["16:00,820","16:12,100","\"Yeah, audio cues for low health like while they're nice because you don't have to like pay attention to the UI\""]
["16:12,860","16:17,660","\"Something like this that's just in your peripherals works just as well without being annoying, you know\""]
["16:17,660","16:22,760","\"They're nice if they if you're playing a game where your your health\""]
["16:22,760","16:27,060","\"Regents after a second then it's like okay, but if it doesn't\""]
["16:27,060","16:31,140","\"Then you're like fucking running around trying to find something just so it's stopped\""]
["16:31,140","16:38,700","\"Whoa, dude. Are you okay? Yeah, you're right. Yeah, like a hiccup. Yeah, I just threw up in my mouth a little bit\""]
["16:41,540","16:43,540","\"Nice reaction time. Yeah\""]
["16:43,540","16:50,480","\"You were awarded ombre in tears of blood for that first you reacted to your own vomit\""]
["16:50,480","16:56,700","\"You're really good at multitasking while I'm impressed\""]
["16:56,700","17:02,180","\"What's up for the spinster\""]
["17:02,180","17:05,060","\"That's like our favorite dark souls enemy\""]
["17:05,060","17:10,280","\"Oh, it is. Oh the thing that and before you fight the guy in the skeleton place\""]
["17:10,280","17:16,540","\"Yeah, oh man recently I was over at my friend's house and he's really brand new to Dark Souls and\""]
["17:16,540","17:21,400","\"He kind of gave up when he got to on dead Berg. He's like man\""]
["17:21,400","17:22,940","\"This game's fucking hard man\""]
["17:22,940","17:29,080","\"It's like watch this and I put it on and I did that thing where you can go straight down the blights out at the very beginning\""]
["17:29,080","17:36,040","\"I beat quielag at like so level one and then I ran to the crypt and I just fell down to the bottom and beat pinwheel\""]
["17:36,040","17:42,200","\"He was like oh my fucking but dude running past the pinwheel skeletons. It was the luckiest run I've ever fucking seen in my life\""]
["17:42,200","17:46,780","\"I was dodging him just completely by sheer fluke and I got past every single one. It was crazy\""]
["17:46,780","17:53,040","\"I will say though like if I'm doing a run. I usually do on deadburg before I do\""]
["17:53,040","18:00,680","\"Blighttown just cuz I fucking hate Blighttown so much to see I always I would always put off Blighttown as long as I could\""]
["18:00,680","18:06,760","\"It's crazy you can like you can beat the game at soul level one if you do a pyromancy. It's really cool\""]
["18:06,760","18:14,600","\"But I would never even bother trying because I want to I never fuck you pyromancy's not even stat dependent right\""]
["18:14,600","18:17,320","\"You see how to spend souls on it\""]
["18:17,320","18:19,440","\"Dark Souls one is such a like\""]
["18:19,440","18:23,240","\"Perfect concoction for replaying it. There's so much different things you can do\""]
["18:23,240","18:28,840","\"It is actually really good for that especially like what you know what you're doing\""]
["18:28,840","18:32,840","\"You can really get far in not a lot of time, which is kind of cool.\""]
["18:32,840","18:33,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["18:33,840","18:37,840","\"It's because your muscle memory is so used to like running past like...\""]
["18:37,840","18:44,840","\"Oh yeah, it's amazing how different your first playthrough and your second playthrough wind up feeling for the first several hours of the game.\""]
["18:44,840","18:48,840","\"Yeah, I feel like my first playthrough took like 60 hours or something stupid.\""]
["18:48,840","18:51,840","\"Oh yeah, my first playthrough I definitely played like a bitch.\""]
["18:51,840","18:55,840","\"Although I feel like I get stuck in really weird parts of those games.\""]
["18:55,840","19:01,320","\"I feel like the bosses that fuck me up are always like not the same ones everyone says is hard\""]
["19:01,320","19:08,720","\"Yeah, like in Dark Souls one it was that fucking the guy at the end of sense fortress like the other colossus\""]
["19:08,720","19:13,640","\"Yeah, that thing just kept like every time I remember that thing being like beating that on my second shot\""]
["19:13,640","19:17,840","\"But I remember the capradeem in taking me like yeah, I hate 50 tries\""]
["19:17,840","19:23,120","\"I I beat fucking Ornstein and smoke on my second try. Oh my god\""]
["19:23,120","19:29,480","\"But that fucking, that fucking random suit of armor at the end of Sense Fortress that everyone says is so easy.\""]
["19:29,480","19:34,320","\"For some reason, I just kept having the experience where it would like knock me off.\""]
["19:34,320","19:40,120","\"And it would always happen either like right at the beginning, so it would be the first attack and it would just one shot me.\""]
["19:40,120","19:43,820","\"Or like right at the end where I was like about to beat it and it would knock me off.\""]
["19:43,820","19:47,120","\"I probably took like 30 tries to beat that thing.\""]
["19:47,120","19:49,720","\"I had a very like range based build.\""]
["19:49,720","19:54,680","\"So anything anything like that that was big and slow is relatively easy.\""]
["19:54,680","19:58,880","\"Where you can just keep your distance, dodge when it charges you and then\""]
["19:58,880","20:02,280","\"throw a bunch of like hard hitting spells at it.\""]
["20:02,280","20:04,520","\"I love this guy's design.\""]
["20:04,520","20:05,440","\"Looks so cool.\""]
["20:05,440","20:10,040","\"All right. Now that I don't have like one fucking hit going up against these.\""]
["20:10,040","20:12,240","\"Yeah, you got this.\""]
["20:12,240","20:14,960","\"I am not afraid of no thing.\""]
["20:14,960","20:16,840","\"Not even him.\""]
["20:16,840","20:17,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:17,840","20:18,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:18,840","20:19,840","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:19,840","20:21,400","\"That looks so good.\""]
["20:21,400","20:22,600","\"I love this.\""]
["20:22,600","20:23,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:23,600","20:24,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:24,600","20:28,040","\"This game is actually pretty fucking cool.\""]
["20:28,040","20:29,040","\"It makes sense.\""]
["20:29,040","20:34,600","\"You make a cool overpowered character, then you just have her fight a bunch of giants,\""]
["20:34,600","20:36,840","\"some mostly overpowered enemies.\""]
["20:36,840","20:40,120","\"And it's super fun.\""]
["20:40,120","20:41,120","\"Yeah.\""]
["20:41,120","20:45,760","\"Anytime you fight something like way bigger than you like this, it's always cool.\""]
["20:45,760","20:48,260","\"I just like the aesthetic of everything in the music.\""]
["20:48,260","20:50,740","\"Yeah, it's pretty sick.\""]
["20:50,740","20:55,340","\"Well, oh, no, you know, I love that they reach behind them too.\""]
["20:55,340","20:59,460","\"How many other games fucking do that have a thing reach behind?\""]
["20:59,460","21:01,900","\"Yeah, like, you're finding a big thing and reaches behind.\""]
["21:01,900","21:04,580","\"Oh, that guy was still alive, huh?\""]
["21:04,580","21:08,100","\"I just got to get my little butthole out.\""]
["21:08,100","21:09,620","\"I fucking love this thing.\""]
["21:09,620","21:13,020","\"You think that thing is just your prolabs?\""]
["21:13,420","21:16,780","\"Probably that's the hairiest part of a woman little known fact\""]
["21:16,780","21:20,420","\"That's how they keep that trap door shut never\""]
["21:20,420","21:25,380","\"Get this on it grings\""]
["21:25,380","21:30,300","\"A golden disc I\""]
["21:30,300","21:36,980","\"Hate that she kisses things like that. I love listening to vinyl. I don't you know why\""]
["21:38,380","21:43,000","\"Why not because my stupid fucking vinyl player only plays one song\""]
["21:43,000","21:49,020","\"What's old what songs that what's all like that be the death song did that\""]
["21:49,020","21:54,260","\"That is an evil song I know\""]
["21:54,260","22:00,960","\"Oh, I did test that song I think it only plays that because it knows when it's gonna happen\""]
["22:00,960","22:05,800","\"Do you have like a haunted phonograph Chris? I mean I\""]
["22:06,820","22:11,340","\"Hacked it you hacked it you're saying it was haunted and then you act it\""]
["22:11,340","22:16,800","\"Are you hacked it into being haunted you got in the main frame all you all you do is you?\""]
["22:16,800","22:21,360","\"You put elastic band around the needle. That's awesome\""]
["22:21,360","22:27,420","\"Just imagine if you could like you had a home invader and then you just\""]
["22:27,420","22:34,260","\"Even if you didn't have guns on your feet that probably freak them out\""]
