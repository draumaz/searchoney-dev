["04:01,740","04:05,320","\"So I don't have any real connections towards fish and other animals. I\""]
["04:05,320","04:12,920","\"Legitimately think fish are the worst pets because they're boring. I've had hamsters and hamsters are pretty terrible\""]
["04:12,920","04:17,000","\"I have a hamster too and I actually there oh they turn red with your blood\""]

["04:31,600","04:37,440","\"Yeah, I had gotten this little cage for it with like all the little do-hickeys and things and I had a vision that\""]
["04:37,440","04:39,440","\"It would like go through the tubes and do all this thing and\""]
["04:40,200","04:43,820","\"The first thing it fucking did was find a way to escape and then die in the bed\""]
["04:43,820","04:48,080","\"That's it. It's all it did. He was a house smell like a rotting animal\""]
["04:48,080","04:52,840","\"And we couldn't find it and I know it was the hamster and it was just like\""]
["04:52,840","04:57,680","\"Why did you do that? You have this fuck there's food here. You have an elaborate\""]
["04:57,680","05:01,700","\"Fucking gym and then you have a place to enjoy yourself\""]
["05:01,700","05:05,640","\"And you're just gonna escape through a hole in the side of the fucking thing and then die you stupid\""]
["05:05,880","05:10,820","\"My hamster instantly got fucking tumors on its ass like the fucking month I got it\""]
["05:10,820","05:16,560","\"Creepy and sad and they literally chew off their own tumors. They like bite them off and eat them. They do. Yeah\""]
["05:16,560","05:24,180","\"I had a hamster bite into itself until blood answers are stupid. Just take it to the nearest scissors cut its head off\""]
["05:24,180","05:26,880","\"Yeah, save it's trouble of doing it's all scissors\""]
["05:26,880","05:31,280","\"Yeah, like I only bet I've ever really had is like a cat\""]
["05:31,600","05:36,320","\"I've had plenty of cats. My mom is a crazy cat lady. She's had like fucking in my lifetime\""]
["05:36,320","05:43,280","\"I've had like 50 cats and so I know a lot about cats when it comes to hamsters and other weird fucking pets. I\""]
["05:43,280","05:49,000","\"Don't know my girlfriend Lexi she's had like a like a fish at one point\""]
["05:49,000","05:53,840","\"And I was and I made fun of the fact that fish are dumb pets and she got upset and I felt bad\""]
["05:53,840","05:57,200","\"But the same time fish are dumb pets. Sorry. I agree with you\""]
["05:57,200","06:00,480","\"I know fish look nice in a room, but you also got a clean up their tank\""]
["06:00,480","06:05,200","\"There's a lot of stuff I watched a video about a guy who's like you know what you're fucking goldfish die so quickly\""]
["06:05,200","06:10,040","\"It's because you haven't followed these 30 30 steps before getting a pet goldfish\""]
["06:10,040","06:16,320","\"And it's like you have to fucking set the PhD level so you have to introduce like bacteria to the water to make sure\""]
["06:16,320","06:22,080","\"It's accustomed to it because the most common reason why goldfish die is because of its own shit\""]
["06:22,080","06:27,760","\"So you have to like basically put bacteria and shit inside the thing so when you put the fish in it\""]
["06:27,920","06:34,160","\"They're used to the shit bacteria water and they'll live longer and there was a guy who was like look at this fucking goldfish\""]
["06:34,160","06:37,860","\"I have that was like this goldfish was like ten years old and it was massive\""]
["06:37,860","06:41,480","\"It was like a giant football and he was petting it and shit that would be cool\""]
["06:41,480","06:48,000","\"But the likeliness of that happening is like nobody when you're a child and someone gives you a fucking goldfish\""]
["06:48,000","06:53,960","\"They're not like by the way little Jimmy be sure to have a previous fish shit in that goldfish bowl about\""]
["06:53,960","06:56,360","\"you know\""]
["06:56,360","06:59,120","\"Like 40 times a day for like a month\""]
["06:59,120","07:04,120","\"Yeah, it helps it you have to introduce like this kind of bacteria\""]
["07:04,120","07:06,920","\"Into a safe watering thing. That's fine\""]
["07:06,920","07:09,440","\"And you can't put it needs like room to move\""]
["07:09,440","07:13,560","\"So that's why people have big goldfish things you have to put in a big goldfish tank\""]
["07:13,560","07:19,360","\"It won't live in one of those shitty little fucking bowls that they barely our parents are swimming around and it'll die and that's what I figured also\""]
["07:19,360","07:23,240","\"One of the people who I grew up with like one of my friends\""]
["07:23,240","07:26,920","\"He had a goldfish in a blackfish and one day\""]
["07:26,920","07:31,300","\"Walked into the kitchen and the goldfish was like floating around upside down, but he was still alive\""]
["07:31,300","07:33,800","\"But his stomach had like\""]
["07:33,800","07:39,940","\"Exploded for some reason and his like intestines were like hanging out and he was just swimming around with a big long intestine\""]
["07:39,940","07:45,940","\"And I was just like like what happened he's like, oh, he just like does that\""]
["07:50,440","07:56,440","\"I have no idea dude. I was too young fucking comprehend what happened. Yeah like a goldfish died really fast because\""]
["07:56,440","08:01,760","\"You know you feed it too much Coca-Cola - yeah, don't pour Coca-Cola\""]
["08:01,760","08:07,040","\"Coca-Cola it'll explode if you feed a fish Coca-Cola will thrive for millennia\""]
["08:07,040","08:15,240","\"Get a thing of Coke Mentos close the top and put a fish in and see what happens\""]
["08:15,240","08:18,440","\"*laughs* You feel the fishbowl? Take good tomatoes.\""]
["08:18,440","08:23,240","\"*laughs* And put a huge fucking break out of some chaos game. Oh no!\""]

["09:25,980","09:32,420","\"I want you to apologize to the audience and write a 10-page essay\""]
["09:32,420","09:36,260","\"I have nothing to fucking say to you. Here's another thing. I can't write\""]
["09:36,260","09:42,420","\"Okay, that's fair. I've seen that you can't write actually true story earlier today true story\""]
["09:42,420","09:49,300","\"I I couldn't write on the lines in school and I went to my what did you write on?\""]
["09:49,300","09:53,340","\"You know, you know how you have like you have like line paper. Yeah, I can comprehend that\""]
["09:53,340","09:57,820","\"It was hard for me to ride on the line. I don't know. It's just like weird. I just couldn't do it and\""]
["09:57,820","10:03,080","\"I never wanted to bring my dad any work because if he saw that he couldn't ride on the line\""]
["10:03,080","10:08,140","\"I'll throw you I was like, you know, I was like 14 so I kind of do better\""]
["10:08,140","10:12,900","\"What the fuck you couldn't ride on the line right on the lines is hard. I'll give you that\""]
["10:12,900","10:15,620","\"It's like I could kind of do it\""]
["10:15,620","10:18,660","\"But eventually I would get to the point where I couldn't perfectly ride on the line\""]
["10:18,660","10:21,060","\"Like I would go off of it because I would get like, you know\""]
["10:21,060","10:23,820","\"You just get like a rhythm of writing and you just start lifting the words off\""]
["10:23,820","10:27,980","\"I got you and like nowadays like I don't really write online paper\""]
["10:27,980","10:31,180","\"I write on normal paper just like that doesn't have lines\""]
["10:31,180","10:33,700","\"So it was like hard for me to do it\""]
["10:33,700","10:38,860","\"But I still try to and then like if you write off the line you want to write back on the line\""]
["10:38,860","10:44,900","\"And then you have like weird tilting letters. You just look like a dumbass got you I would do that and would piss my dad off\""]
["10:44,900","10:47,820","\"And he would be like rewrite everything\""]
["10:47,820","10:50,860","\"like\""]
["10:50,860","10:53,840","\"And then I would have to do that and so\""]
["10:53,840","10:58,800","\"Eventually I do the work at like nine but my dad would make me do writing assessments\""]
["10:58,800","11:00,560","\"So I learned how to write on a lot on the paper\""]
["11:00,560","11:05,460","\"And it would I would be up to like two in the morning and I would never get my homework done because my dad was making\""]
