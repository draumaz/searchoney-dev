["02:05,880","02:06,880","\"Talk it out.\""]
["02:06,880","02:09,640","\"Why do you think you were getting all those strange calls?\""]
["02:09,640","02:11,280","\"Because there's supernatural shit happening.\""]
["02:11,280","02:13,440","\"Have you noticed how weird things have been?\""]
["02:13,440","02:17,400","\"You mean with all the solo survivors, androids, and long-haired punk kids you've been rolling\""]

["02:18,400","02:20,040","\"No, even before that.\""]
["02:20,040","02:22,040","\"When do you think it started?\""]
["02:22,040","02:26,760","\"Well, I guess around the time I came home from school for starters.\""]
["02:26,760","02:28,760","\"Pretty sure that's where the narrative began.\""]
["02:28,760","02:31,880","\"But I didn't see my mom for weeks.\""]
["02:31,880","02:36,800","\"When I finally did, she changed and I found myself saying some really bratty things.\""]
["02:36,800","02:38,160","\"Mostly normal.\""]
["02:38,160","02:40,840","\"No, it wasn't.\""]
["02:40,840","02:42,320","\"Something is weird.\""]
["02:42,320","02:44,280","\"Where's my dad been?\""]
["02:44,280","02:45,520","\"Don't you remember?\""]
["02:45,520","02:48,520","\"My dad worked for Pacific Chime.\""]
["02:48,520","02:56,120","\"What? My mom? No. My mom worked for Moon macro systems. They met at that programming convention.\""]
["02:56,120","02:58,620","\"When do my mom start working for Pacific Chime?\""]
["02:58,620","02:59,820","\"You don't have a dad.\""]
["02:59,820","03:03,920","\"Dad? I do. Of course I do. Everyone has a dad.\""]
["03:03,920","03:05,320","\"Then where is he?\""]
["03:05,320","03:07,320","\"I wish Panda was my dad.\""]
["03:07,320","03:11,120","\"And then Michael. When did Michael move back to Frankton?\""]
["03:11,120","03:13,620","\"Didn't Michael move away when he was ten?\""]
["03:13,620","03:15,120","\"When did he move away?\""]
["03:15,120","03:17,320","\"Pfft. Michael.\""]
["03:17,320","03:20,880","\"He's just losing his mind. I know sorry Michael's nineteen. I\""]
["03:20,880","03:26,000","\"Think I said that yeah, I said twenty year earlier. So you were right. You actually paid more attention\""]
["03:26,000","03:29,640","\"I did meaning still you're giving beer to a nineteen year old good\""]
["03:29,640","03:34,560","\"He was a mid-century model style but sometime around the late 80s\""]
["03:34,560","03:39,280","\"Uh-huh don't care. Just shut up. Yeah\""]
["03:39,280","03:42,000","\"Yep, yep\""]
["03:43,400","03:45,400","\"'Cause he was like...\""]
["03:45,400","03:47,000","\"How is he proving to you that he remembers?\""]
["03:47,000","03:48,600","\"How does this tie into the story?\""]
["03:48,600","03:51,800","\"And now I'm feeling like he's just literally forgetting where he is.\""]
["03:51,800","03:57,400","\"He's like grandpa Simpson telling me that they were a turn up on their belt.\""]
["03:57,400","04:00,800","\"'Cause it was the fashion at the time.\""]
["04:00,800","04:08,600","\"Why is Michael back in Frankton?\""]
["04:08,600","04:12,000","\"Didn't they move to Canada when his dad got that publishing deal?\""]
["04:12,000","04:15,560","\"He sold his house right didn't a cute girl move in there\""]
["04:15,560","04:19,000","\"When would you just be at the point of fine?\""]
["04:19,000","04:24,880","\"Nothing matters anymore. I accept it. I don't care. You don't even ask questions long ago long ago\""]
["04:24,880","04:28,240","\"Probably went up like I think the first time I saw a sheet man\""]
["04:28,240","04:34,220","\"I'd just be like, you know, I'm gonna say made of stars appears before me. I'd probably be like, okay\""]
["04:34,220","04:36,980","\"I think my like my worldview has been challenged\""]
["04:36,980","04:37,980","\"*laughs*\""]
["04:37,980","04:43,980","\"*muffled voice* He moved away. You went to hang out with him and he had given you the wrong address or something like that.\""]
["04:43,980","04:50,980","\"Yeah, sort of. He had me meet him at a mall near his house and when I got there he never showed up. That was the last I heard of him.\""]
["04:50,980","04:52,980","\"*muffled voice* You should go ask him.\""]
["04:52,980","04:53,980","\"*muffled* What time is it?\""]

["05:05,980","05:13,240","\"Okie dokie I guess something news happened did you see that that was reality breaking this up? Who's that daddy?\""]
["05:13,240","05:20,580","\"Alex dear the little girl next door moved into Michael's house with looking for you\""]
["05:20,580","05:28,700","\"Like that that's my name unless you can think of a better one\""]
["05:28,700","05:33,500","\"Something with my shimmer like Antonio by an angle stando\""]
["05:33,500","05:35,500","\"Here's pom.\""]
["05:35,500","05:38,500","\"That never gets old.\""]

["06:10,200","06:16,900","\"I'm your in your front yard hiding behind this tree. Now it's your turn to hide. Oh, yeah, I wanted to say I love you.\""]
["06:16,900","06:23,360","\"Oh, I'm glad everything worked out. Did you know that was there? Hey, Chris. She was there all along. I knew it.\""]
["06:23,360","06:28,860","\"I don't think that's the real Sammy Peck. You should have thought to check outside your front door.\""]

["08:11,180","08:12,820","\"- Have you figured it out?\""]
["08:12,820","08:14,460","\"- You know?\""]
["08:14,460","08:15,660","\"- What's happening?\""]
["08:15,660","08:18,660","\"This reality has already started to break.\""]
["08:18,660","08:20,660","\"This didn't start today, did it?\""]
["08:20,660","08:23,660","\"I see. So you have noticed.\""]
["08:23,660","08:29,660","\"Only just today. I'm pretty oblivious to things I don't want to see. If you haven't noticed.\""]
["08:29,660","08:33,660","\"So, would you like me to clear some things up?\""]
["08:33,660","08:36,660","\"Of course. Give it to me straight.\""]
["08:36,660","08:38,660","\"Next position, isn't it?\""]
["08:38,660","08:43,660","\"The reality. A place where a new soul to enter that reality becomes available.\""]
["08:43,660","08:49,380","\"Our souls are in constant transit if we do not enter the soul space and take direct control\""]
["08:49,380","08:53,540","\"So this Michael here is not the Michael from your childhood\""]
["08:53,540","08:58,900","\"Your Michael is as he is a combination of all Michaels\""]
["08:58,900","09:00,340","\"Oh\""]
["09:00,340","09:02,940","\"So did the old Michael leave this reality?\""]
["09:02,940","09:06,780","\"This reality is shattered\""]
["09:06,780","09:11,540","\"Lost souls in the soul space are slipping in and out of it so\""]
["09:12,420","09:14,420","\"Claudia and Chandra\""]
["09:14,420","09:37,920","\"How can you let two people in for one person?\""]

["09:40,820","09:46,340","\"Yeah, I understand so far. No, that means Alex was lying\""]
["09:46,340","09:49,340","\"Because if you think about her doesn't have up\""]
["09:49,340","10:00,180","\"So a version of Michael Rory Chandra and Claudio all come to this reality for what?\""]

["10:06,100","10:11,180","\"This reality is broken and from what I can tell it's been broken for a long time.\""]
["10:11,180","10:17,060","\"I do not know. We must first see what form you take to destroy this reality.\""]
["10:17,060","10:20,420","\"Okay, I'll be the state puff marshmallow man.\""]
["10:20,420","10:23,740","\"Why does it have to be me?\""]
