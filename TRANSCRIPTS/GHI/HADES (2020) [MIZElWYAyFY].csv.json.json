["[\"10:48,080\",\"10:52,060\",\"\\\"That's definitely not true. You could unlock a weapon. Whoa, okay?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"10:52,060\",\"10:58,680\",\"\\\"Hmm now I can get is the bow. I guess I can get is the bow. I actually hate the bow, but you could try it\\\"\"]"]
["[\"10:58,680\",\"11:04,240\",\"\\\"You might like it. Yeah, I don't think you're gonna. I got rid of my other weapon. Oh, yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:04,240\",\"11:07,360\",\"\\\"You can no no you can get it back. It's it's the sword right there\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:08,000\",\"11:15,520\",\"\\\"What happened to my cool whoa, but you can test any weapons out on skelly that's cool. He can infinitely regenerate\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:15,520\",\"11:19,080\",\"\\\"I don't want this piece of shit. I get to get the sword back. Oh\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:19,080\",\"11:21,080\",\"\\\"Okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:21,080\",\"11:26,360\",\"\\\"I was gonna say I say I spent a lot of time saving up for that spear and I wound up really liking it\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:26,360\",\"11:27,640\",\"\\\"but then\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:27,640\",\"11:34,880\",\"\\\"Eventually you get like a like a like a knuckle weapon and that turned out to be my favorite. Okay. Yeah that I like that one too\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:34,880\",\"11:36,880\",\"\\\"How long is this game?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:36,960\",\"11:41,040\",\"\\\"As long as you want it to be really say one full run once you're like\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:41,040\",\"11:45,260\",\"\\\"Once you've got it down and usually it takes a bit of building up your character\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:45,260\",\"11:48,520\",\"\\\"But like a full run is never designed to take more than a half hour\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:48,520\",\"11:51,360\",\"\\\"This is really pretty\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:51,360\",\"11:54,320\",\"\\\"Yeah, it's got like a really good art style\\\"\"]"]
["[\"11:54,320\",\"12:01,920\",\"\\\"Yeah, they've got all that nice like black shading. So I go out here. Yeah, yep, and that's where you start\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:03,960\",\"12:09,440\",\"\\\"You're right back into it this fucking song always reminds me of the Macarena every time I hear it\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:09,440\",\"12:12,720\",\"\\\"It does says it's like well Macadole my god\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:12,720\",\"12:21,240\",\"\\\"Well, thanks Zeus\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:21,240\",\"12:23,760\",\"\\\"I would do the epic one. Yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:23,760\",\"12:29,920\",\"\\\"So that that's just a little bit better than it would usually be oh, so I lost everything because I died\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:29,920\",\"12:32,640\",\"\\\"Yeah, all those powers reset every round\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:33,400\",\"12:42,860\",\"\\\"That's like the binding of Isaac aspect. What was that it that thing? Oh, no, it's your special. You're why? Yeah, so every time you hit\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:42,860\",\"12:49,680\",\"\\\"Why to do your big special it'll also do a lightning strike. Oh, I see now that you have something on your special\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:49,680\",\"12:52,680\",\"\\\"Your special is like disproportionately stronger than your regular\\\"\"]"]
["[\"12:52,680\",\"12:59,560\",\"\\\"Okay, so you'll want to abuse the shit out of it. Yeah, so this game is essentially just like\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:00,200\",\"13:05,960\",\"\\\"You try to last as long as you can you try to get as powerful as you can in a run in hopes of making it through to the end\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:05,960\",\"13:07,960\",\"\\\"So it's essentially like noita. Yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:07,960\",\"13:13,000\",\"\\\"It's just I would I would go Zeus again. Yeah, okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:13,000\",\"13:18,520\",\"\\\"You're gonna make this is like a big like Diablo story kind of a game\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:18,520\",\"13:23,920\",\"\\\"It does have a story. It's definitely got a story, but it's much more fun to play than Diablo\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:23,920\",\"13:25,920\",\"\\\"Well in my opinion this kind of\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:25,920\",\"13:28,120\",\"\\\"Combats a lot more fun\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:28,240\",\"13:34,500\",\"\\\"Yeah, no, this feels really nice. I would go for the dash. I think I would go for the jolted. Oh, okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:34,500\",\"13:40,440\",\"\\\"Yeah, that'll make your lightning also add figures them. Yeah, it's like a stun effect cool\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:40,440\",\"13:44,640\",\"\\\"Hades said like I'm trying to get to the surface. That's the whole point of the game\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:44,640\",\"13:50,380\",\"\\\"Yeah, well, he says that you're not going to because he thinks you're a little bitch, but I'm not well\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:50,380\",\"13:56,840\",\"\\\"Yeah, prove him wrong. Yeah, so Hades is really the your enemy in this. He's your father and the bad guy\\\"\"]"]
["[\"13:56,840\",\"14:01,040\",\"\\\"Wait really? Yeah, wow these guys are danguses. They are\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:01,040\",\"14:06,400\",\"\\\"And actually the one guy who drew this designed them to be like the biggest dingus\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:06,400\",\"14:13,360\",\"\\\"So the thing on the left gives you another 25 max HP and the thing on the right will upgrade one of your\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:13,360\",\"14:16,120\",\"\\\"spells of which you have I\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:16,120\",\"14:23,080\",\"\\\"Guess two now. I'll just do the HP for now also side note the guy who voices Zagreus your character\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:23,080\",\"14:27,060\",\"\\\"Is the dude who did all the music for the game wait really yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:27,060\",\"14:32,060\",\"\\\"All the music for all these you just like the sound guy for that company\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:32,060\",\"14:38,920\",\"\\\"I don't know but the fucking soundtracks to this game are goddamn great. Yeah, that's real impressive\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:38,920\",\"14:45,100\",\"\\\"Like I listen to the fucking bastion soundtrack for such a long time. See now you got more max health\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:45,100\",\"14:47,100\",\"\\\"So I've got max health, but then when I die\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:48,100\",\"14:54,060\",\"\\\"No money don't go that that'll be a waste so if I die I'm gonna lose my max health upgrades forever\\\"\"]"]
["[\"14:54,060\",\"15:01,400\",\"\\\"Yes, okay, so everything gets lost but eventually you can upgrade your max health like your base max health up to a hundred\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:01,400\",\"15:07,920\",\"\\\"Gotcha. All right. This is interesting. I like this. I got super into this game. This is like the first game\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:07,920\",\"15:11,820\",\"\\\"I've gotten like really into in a while. Yeah, no, I'm on the same page\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:11,820\",\"15:17,780\",\"\\\"I like I want like 40 hours of this game already. Yeah, I'm probably in about the same\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:17,780\",\"15:20,960\",\"\\\"I was doing so well and not getting hit and he hit me three times in a fucking row\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:20,960\",\"15:26,180\",\"\\\"Yeah, just remember that your dash makes you invincible. Okay that thing on the left is money\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:26,180\",\"15:33,280\",\"\\\"Usually that's not super important going for like a god like the one on the right is usually like the best thing to do\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:33,280\",\"15:35,080\",\"\\\"okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:35,080\",\"15:37,620\",\"\\\"And if you ever see the hammer always go for the hammer\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:37,620\",\"15:43,660\",\"\\\"Why is everyone in the underworld so rude you fucking dickhead?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:43,660\",\"15:46,360\",\"\\\"There always coming in completely uninvited.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:46,360\",\"15:48,660\",\"\\\"Can I get my health back in a play or no?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:48,660\",\"15:52,260\",\"\\\"Can you get your health back in a what? In like a run?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:52,260\",\"15:56,160\",\"\\\"Yes, so you you upgraded yourself in a way where\\\"\"]"]
["[\"15:56,160\",\"16:01,860\",\"\\\"If you go through every time you go into a new room you get one health back also\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:01,860\",\"16:05,460\",\"\\\"You can buy healing items from Caron and there's some\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:05,460\",\"16:12,460\",\"\\\"Items that give you the ability to heal which will make sense once you get them. Yeah, okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:12,700\",\"16:17,940\",\"\\\"Either the first two it would be good. Yeah, I would probably do the attack one or I don't know\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:17,940\",\"16:22,060\",\"\\\"What do you think that yeah at least now you're dashed as damage again\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:22,060\",\"16:25,700\",\"\\\"And it inflicts the weak status\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:25,700\",\"16:31,860\",\"\\\"Yeah, Poseidon stuff is fun. His stuff is all about causing like knockback these guys\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:31,860\",\"16:36,600\",\"\\\"No, that Poseidon the god who's booing you'll get if you beat them\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:39,020\",\"16:43,360\",\"\\\"So the last few times I got hit I thought I thought by hitting them with this\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:43,360\",\"16:47,100\",\"\\\"I'd be staggering them and they wouldn't be able to be doing attacks, but I fucking was wrong\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:47,100\",\"16:52,760\",\"\\\"Yeah, I'm careful their explosions can hurt them, but they definitely hurt you real bad. Yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:52,760\",\"16:59,620\",\"\\\"Fuchers and also when they die they drop a final bomb. So always dash away when you kill one. Okay\\\"\"]"]
["[\"16:59,620\",\"17:02,500\",\"\\\"Fuck\\\"\"]"]
["[\"17:02,500\",\"17:07,620\",\"\\\"This music's cool. Yeah, you got it\\\"\"]"]

["[\"17:24,460\",\"17:31,620\",\"\\\"Oh, I would go for the attack yeah hands down\\\"\"]"]
["[\"17:31,620\",\"17:36,020\",\"\\\"You're you now your attacks gonna have way more damage and have a bunch of knockback\\\"\"]"]
["[\"17:36,020\",\"17:41,860\",\"\\\"That's gonna slam enemies into walls and stuff. Yeah, you've got a good like spread of stuff\\\"\"]"]
["[\"17:41,860\",\"17:46,340\",\"\\\"So your attacks and stuff each thing that you can do can only have one thing on it at a time\\\"\"]"]
["[\"17:46,340\",\"17:49,380\",\"\\\"Okay. Yeah, does this entire game take place in the underworld?\\\"\"]"]
["[\"17:49,380\",\"17:53,260\",\"\\\"It doesn't all look like this if that's what you're asking like there's more environments\\\"\"]"]
["[\"17:53,260\",\"18:00,380\",\"\\\"I'm way more powerful. No, holy shit. Yeah, you can also use your regular attack now that it's powered up. Okay. I\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:00,940\",\"18:05,660\",\"\\\"Mean not that you couldn't use it before it's also power up. It's that much more worthwhile. Yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:05,660\",\"18:08,780\",\"\\\"Whoa, he died instantly\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:08,780\",\"18:17,140\",\"\\\"No, fuck I'm so I think you can't like I'm pretty sure when you do your special that ring will yeah\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:17,140\",\"18:23,700\",\"\\\"It destroys all their little purple balls. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're probably not that worried about their buttons\\\"\"]"]

["[\"18:29,340\",\"18:38,520\",\"\\\"Oh fuck you got me. Boom. And that reminds me of Drake of the 99 dragons. What's Drake\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:38,520\",\"18:42,480\",\"\\\"of the 99 dragon? It's the biggest piece of shit ever. This is a horrible game for\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:42,480\",\"18:47,960\",\"\\\"the Xbox and PS2. It did have like a nice like cel shaded style but it wasn't very\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:47,960\",\"18:53,660\",\"\\\"good. Look at that mess you just made. You splattered blood on the floor. I didn't\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:53,660\",\"18:54,860\",\"\\\"I can put the blood there.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"18:54,860\",\"18:58,220\",\"\\\"Should talk to these every time.\\\"\"]"]

["[\"19:13,260\",\"19:14,660\",\"\\\"Oh, yeah, that'd be good to get.\\\"\"]"]

["[\"19:16,760\",\"19:19,460\",\"\\\"It gives you a chance to run into a type of chamber\\\"\"]"]
["[\"19:19,460\",\"19:21,160\",\"\\\"where it's just a healing fountain\\\"\"]"]
["[\"19:21,160\",\"19:23,060\",\"\\\"and it restores all your health.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"19:23,160\",\"19:24,240\",\"\\\"- I see.\\\"\"]"]
["[\"19:24,240\",\"19:26,320\",\"\\\"- So there's a lot of dialogue in this game.\\\"\"]"]
