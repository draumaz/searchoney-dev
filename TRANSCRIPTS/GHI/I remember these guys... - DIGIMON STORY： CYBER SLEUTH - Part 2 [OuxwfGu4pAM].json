["00:28,680","00:29,480","\">> Which one do you like?\""]
["00:29,480","00:31,880","\"Do the first one because he was from the third season, right?\""]
["00:31,880","00:32,880","\"Yeah, he was.\""]
["00:32,880","00:33,880","\"I remember him.\""]
["00:33,880","00:35,680","\"He was from the Dijimon movie.\""]
["00:35,680","00:37,480","\"Was it called \"\"Tamers in America\"\"?\""]
["00:37,480","00:39,880","\"No, I think it was just Dijimon.\""]
["00:39,880","00:43,880","\"I remember they kept advertising it with like, \"\"Get real\"\" or something.\""]
["00:43,880","00:46,280","\"Yeah, because it was, they really liked the meta aspect of it.\""]
["00:46,280","00:48,080","\"Yeah, Terry, you're Mon.\""]
["00:48,080","00:49,280","\"He's kind of cute.\""]
["00:49,280","00:50,280","\"I like him.\""]
["00:50,280","00:52,480","\"I remember he did a move for his eyeballs fallout.\""]
["00:52,480","00:54,480","\"I like him because he's a little ass-fed.\""]
["00:54,480","00:57,080","\"I like the really scary look in Dijimon.\""]
["00:57,080","01:01,920","\"There was a bunch of like demonic like like I mean that was what I really liked about it at the beginning yeah\""]
["01:01,920","01:07,000","\"Yeah, they're really gross. They're all being always have veins on them and everything\""]
["01:07,000","01:12,740","\"Wow, I feel like around tamer's is when they were starting to change up the design. Yeah, they're getting cute\""]
["01:12,740","01:19,700","\"That's another reason why I never really got more into pokémon's cuz yeah the design act that changes over time. Yeah\""]
["01:21,080","01:26,020","\"And sorry guys. I'm just kind of a kind of a traditionalist dudes. You're a gen-wonder\""]
["01:26,020","01:31,840","\"But gen-wonder you guys obviously Pokemon red was the best one. Okay. He's a gen-wonder\""]
["01:31,840","01:34,400","\"Look guys\""]
["01:34,400","01:37,240","\"You made a little bird oh sad\""]
["01:37,240","01:43,840","\"Like gen 2 and ever played silver. That's why I want to play it. I think you'd like it a lot\""]
["01:43,840","01:50,860","\"I want to see what I miss though. My tiny child's mind. The only reason I didn't play it was because Pokemon wasn't cool anymore\""]
["01:50,860","01:55,280","\"I was like oh that's too bad. I can't be caught. I do remember that when I was a kid when I got it\""]
["01:55,280","02:00,640","\"I remember my parents and everybody around me was like you're still playing that. I was doubly uncool\""]
["02:00,640","02:03,040","\"I didn't even think about it that at the time, but that was my first\""]
["02:03,040","02:09,100","\"I wish I didn't care at the time so far. Not only it was was it my first Pokemon game\""]
["02:09,100","02:11,100","\"But it was my first video game was\""]
["02:11,100","02:12,680","\"Oh my gold. I mean Chris\""]
["02:12,680","02:16,940","\"That's the way that it works people tell you to feel bad about things that are arbitrary. Yeah, I know right\""]
["02:16,940","02:19,840","\"And then you go, \"\"No, I don't like it anymore!\"\"\""]
["02:19,840","02:21,440","\"Welcome to the internet!\""]
["02:21,440","02:26,740","\"I think part of the reason things fizzle out over time is not because people legitimately are getting bored.\""]
["02:26,740","02:30,140","\"It can even just be something as simple as that over exposure to it.\""]
["02:30,140","02:32,140","\"Yeah, you're right. You're right.\""]
["02:32,140","02:35,440","\"For example, keep something.\""]
["02:35,440","02:39,140","\"When they hear battle Royale now, they don't get as excited as they once did.\""]
["02:39,140","02:40,140","\"Right?\""]
["02:40,140","02:41,940","\"Right?\""]
["02:41,940","02:44,440","\"Is this King of Hearts?\""]
["02:44,440","02:45,140","\"It is.\""]
["02:45,640","02:46,640","\"This is a heartless.\""]
["02:46,640","02:47,640","\"Mm-hmm.\""]
["02:47,640","02:48,640","\"He kinda looks like one.\""]
["02:48,640","02:49,640","\"I think so.\""]
["02:49,640","02:51,040","\"This thing is piss Chris.\""]
["02:51,040","02:52,640","\"He recognizes your art style.\""]
["02:52,640","02:53,640","\"No!\""]
["02:53,640","02:56,640","\"Look, even Terri or Mon is scared.\""]
["02:56,640","02:59,640","\"Doesn't amount whatsoever.\""]
["02:59,640","03:02,240","\"Does Terri or Mon ever amount?\""]
["03:02,240","03:04,240","\"In this, specifically, or in general?\""]
["03:04,240","03:05,240","\"I'm sure he does.\""]
["03:05,240","03:06,240","\"Whoa!\""]
["03:06,240","03:07,240","\"I don't think he's like that about that.\""]
["03:07,240","03:08,240","\"Is that my look great, Mon?\""]
["03:08,240","03:09,640","\"He has kind of a stoic expression.\""]
["03:09,640","03:10,640","\"No, that's...\""]
["03:10,640","03:12,140","\"That's a different one.\""]
["03:12,140","03:13,640","\"I think that's Machine Dremon.\""]
["03:13,640","03:14,640","\"They look the same.\""]
["03:14,640","03:17,360","\"My mom got me a toy my old grandma I probably already told you this story\""]
["03:17,360","03:23,640","\"But I don't think so but she got me a really really badly made toy that was painted horribly\""]
["03:23,640","03:26,680","\"So I bought Warhammer paint and I repainted it\""]
["03:26,680","03:30,280","\"And then it's a good idea I had one moment where I was like that looks much better\""]
["03:30,280","03:35,200","\"And then I instantly just felt really bad that I like ruined a gift she got me so I painted him back to how he looked\""]
["03:35,200","03:38,400","\"That's too bad I can\""]
["03:38,400","03:48,240","\"I'm like a godstuffer at that point it has like 50 layers in all of the monster collecting stuff\""]
["03:48,240","03:50,240","\"I was like the idea of\""]
["03:50,240","03:56,240","\"Personalizing it. I don't like the idea that like okay if you have a Pikachu that looks like how identical to every other\""]
["03:56,240","03:59,720","\"Pikachu I guess I get stupidly sentimental over objects and\""]
["03:59,720","04:02,520","\"gifts\""]
["04:02,520","04:05,620","\"Gifts yeah, if people give me a gift I find it extremely hard\""]
["04:07,000","04:10,400","\"Like gift images. Oh, yeah, it's seriously so much\""]
["04:10,400","04:14,940","\"Your friend waved at you Chris. I can't believe streamlabs invented gifts\""]
["04:14,940","04:19,480","\"No, they know how to pronounce it properly the better what?\""]
["04:19,480","04:26,620","\"Yeah, it's pronounced a jiff. No, it's not it's pronounced jiffy gifster said so's pronounced an eye trust in a image\""]
["04:26,620","04:29,360","\"9.3\""]
["04:29,360","04:34,600","\"Do you know what gift stands for graphic interface is is fine fuckers?\""]
["04:34,600","04:35,100","\"FAST!\""]
["04:35,100","04:36,600","\"*laughter*\""]
["04:36,600","04:40,600","\"That is just, that's as caveman as you can get.\""]
["04:40,600","04:42,600","\"*laughter*\""]
["04:42,600","04:44,600","\"*laughter*\""]
["04:44,600","04:46,600","\"It is, it loads.\""]
["04:46,600","04:48,600","\"It's a very tiny file size.\""]
["04:48,600","04:51,600","\"It's not optimized though, if you're making a long gif image.\""]
["04:51,600","04:53,600","\"I will obviously know.\""]
["04:53,600","04:55,600","\"No, but as a single image, if it wasn't animated.\""]
["04:55,600","04:58,600","\"Remember that they introduced animated P&G's.\""]
["04:58,600","04:59,600","\"Did they really?\""]
["04:59,600","05:00,600","\"Yeah, it didn't get used to much.\""]
["05:00,600","05:03,600","\"I've always wanted to make one and I have no fucking clue how.\""]
["05:03,600","05:09,840","\"Hmm. I've always wanted to see how nice it is. It's that I assume it's just not supported as the problem, right?\""]
["05:09,840","05:15,440","\"I'm not sure what the process is like. This was years and years back when they like first hello\""]
["05:15,440","05:22,440","\"They're still around. I'm pretty sure they're still around. That's weird. It's just I don't think people really utilize them much\""]
["05:22,440","05:29,960","\"But they exist. It's a thing. I see do you use TGA's do you use Targas? No? I don't I only use PNGs\""]
["05:32,120","05:34,120","\"I use a\""]
["05:34,120","05:36,480","\"Pretty nice called graphic\""]
["05:36,480","05:44,920","\"I used TIFF sometimes God you're such a dork. Nobody knows you're talking about that's not even a real extension\""]
["05:44,920","05:51,400","\"I use dot or TA. I use dot BMP. No, you don't that's too big\""]
["05:51,400","05:58,960","\"The files are big so they're cooler. It's not about as I'm that's uncompressed as you can possibly get very very heavily uncompressed\""]
["05:59,720","06:05,420","\"And I remember a lot of old games like old PC games would just like store the graphical information that way\""]
["06:05,420","06:10,420","\"Yeah, blue's my mom. Where's Armageddon does it? Wow? That's a lot of bitmap files guess what Chris\""]
["06:10,420","06:13,720","\"Is it Elguma?\""]
["06:13,720","06:17,540","\"Yeah, there he is that looks really good\""]

["06:27,520","06:36,420","\"Wait, no, this is a Disney game. It's Luigi, right? It looks like him from there. Oh, yeah, it's like Goku or something, right?\""]
["06:36,420","06:41,280","\"What's his name again the striper?\""]
["06:41,280","06:46,440","\"Striper. Gabamon. Gabamon. That's right. Did you run question mark?\""]

["06:51,620","06:54,220","\"We have come up the other side.\""]
["06:54,220","06:55,420","\"Oh, that hurts.\""]
["06:55,420","06:56,620","\"We first showed up at our house.\""]
["06:56,620","07:00,020","\"One of the first things we did was watch the American, the dub,\""]
["07:00,020","07:01,020","\"Digimon Movie Day.\""]

["07:19,620","07:21,020","\"It has nothing to do with anything right now,\""]

["07:25,680","07:29,480","\"This happened with the voice of a fulgrun woman\""]
["07:29,480","07:34,640","\"Eight for your old and then a place funks old brother. Oh, yeah\""]
["07:34,640","07:40,440","\"Boyce well it shits itself in a cat scratches it and then what that scene is all of like ten seconds long\""]

["08:53,240","08:56,400","\"There probably is a poop on\""]
["08:56,400","09:03,180","\"How come there is new amount how come Digimon world one revolves so much around eating shit because poop is a big part of\""]
["09:03,180","09:07,840","\"The digital pets. Yeah, cuz they were shit themselves to death. Is it really they literally?\""]
["09:08,840","09:13,880","\"They shit more than any virtual head. It's like what every five minutes\""]

["09:18,680","09:24,520","\"Yeah, they did you evolve into a specific thing? Oh, I'm pretty sure in some of the games certain Digimon do eat the poop\""]
["09:24,520","09:28,140","\"You know the first one I remember those slime ones that eat it. Yeah, the new mine\""]
["09:28,140","09:31,900","\"These green and he looked like a slug and he looks scary. Mm-hmm\""]
["09:31,900","09:38,320","\"He's in this hey did your mom. There's even different versions of him in this hello. Wait, who's freaking here?\""]
["09:38,320","09:45,400","\"That's not fucking natural. That's not non-life. That's not how I'd repeat that. Don't wave him by here.\""]
["09:45,400","09:50,320","\"My uncle can move his actually no he can. He can move his floppy long rabbit ears to you.\""]
["09:50,320","09:53,100","\"No, he used to do this thing where I misremembered it.\""]
["09:53,100","09:58,440","\"I used to be able to, I thought he was in the move his ears really fast because he did it once to me as a kid.\""]
["09:58,440","10:03,580","\"And I remembered him flipping his ears back and forth really fast in my head. You found out he was faking it.\""]
["10:03,580","10:06,440","\"No, then when I grew up I was like, hey, can you still do that thing? What yours?\""]
["10:06,440","10:10,800","\"Oh, yes, and he did it. It was just really just really slow wiggling. I was like oh\""]
["10:10,800","10:15,800","\"I really was like oh\""]
["10:15,800","10:18,200","\"So much cooler\""]
["10:18,200","10:22,600","\"15 years, but I still love the guy we have to\""]
["10:22,600","10:26,240","\"I didn't cut him off about it\""]
["10:26,240","10:32,780","\"We have to grind a little bit. I know that you guys didn't want to do a lot of whole lot of grinding\""]
["10:32,780","10:37,080","\"But okay, I don't know if you spotted the percentage that pops up at the beginning of the battle\""]
["10:37,080","10:43,380","\"You have to fill that up in order to defeat him right in the Digimon ding-dong what what's your favorite Digimon song?\""]
["10:43,380","10:46,980","\"From like actual\""]
["10:46,980","10:51,940","\"Yeah, I would say butterfly butterfly butterflies. That's the Japanese theme song\""]
["10:51,940","10:59,020","\"I like that one too\""]
["11:00,740","11:06,120","\"Resilient opening that's the best one that the lady gets a product. Yeah, she's the best version\""]
["11:06,120","11:08,120","\"I\""]
["11:08,120","11:13,500","\"Remember that because specifically rock cock years and years and years ago told me about how he was staying there\""]
["11:13,500","11:15,500","\"And that was how he grew up a digimon\""]
["11:15,500","11:19,640","\"And he was just not opening what a legend she's dressed up like Sora, right?\""]
["11:19,640","11:25,420","\"Yes, and then she multiplies in the three of herself and start you can show down screen if you want when they take a cartoon like that\""]
["11:25,420","11:26,300","\"and make like\""]
["11:26,300","11:30,020","\"Intentionally make it stupider and like I mean they do\""]
["11:30,020","11:32,020","\"That's a lot of variations.\""]
["11:32,020","11:34,020","\"They make it intentionally like stupid.\""]
["11:34,020","11:36,020","\"Like did you ever see the German X-Men opening?\""]
["11:36,020","11:37,020","\"No.\""]
["11:37,020","11:40,020","\"They superimpose little kids over who are rapping about the X-Men.\""]

["11:44,020","11:46,020","\"Get stepped over and over.\""]
["11:46,020","11:50,020","\"But they do that a lot.\""]
["11:50,020","11:55,020","\"I don't know why. There are a lot of old cartoon openings where they just superimposed actual people over it.\""]
["11:55,020","11:57,020","\"And it's not like they're known celebrities in some cases.\""]
["11:57,020","11:58,020","\"It's just like, I don't know.\""]
["11:58,020","12:01,880","\"The Brazilian one is right like she's a she might be she's a TV personality\""]
["12:01,880","12:08,960","\"Extremely offensive of a bebrizzil. It seems like they don't have real digimon there. No, it seems like\""]
["12:08,960","12:12,460","\"Society is holding them back ten years for some reason\""]
["12:12,460","12:19,460","\"Technologically wise like have you ever seen their version of guitar hero? It's called guitar idol and it's on a Sega Genesis\""]
["12:19,460","12:23,080","\"And they had a Genesis that played guitar hero\""]
["12:23,580","12:30,980","\"While regular guitar hero was out and their version of res evil 4 is like a mobile phone port that's on it like another\""]
["12:30,980","12:38,720","\"Console it's like the weirdest shit. I'm always really intrigued by that kind of thing and they have like pictures of Goku on like every restaurant\""]
["12:38,720","12:44,860","\"He's always the mascot of every restaurant cuz everyone loves it. Oh man. I remember a while back\""]
["12:44,860","12:50,600","\"We went to a marketplace with all the bootleg stuff. Yeah, they had packs of bootleg Pokemon cards\""]
["12:50,600","12:52,000","\"So we wanted to buy a bunch of them.\""]
["12:52,000","12:54,040","\"- That's right, I was really sad.\""]
["12:54,040","12:56,160","\"I didn't have any cash that day.\""]
["12:56,160","12:57,640","\"I really wanted some bootleg shit.\""]
["12:57,640","13:00,000","\"- It's like a cashier too, a position of like,\""]
["13:00,000","13:01,920","\"yes, you think there's a real Pokemon cards, right?\""]
["13:01,920","13:03,560","\"- Oh yeah, I'm sure she doesn't know.\""]
["13:03,560","13:04,560","\"- We know their bootlegs.\""]
["13:04,560","13:07,040","\"- Yeah, the whole appeal is that it's wrong.\""]
["13:07,040","13:09,480","\"- You tell them you think they're real, right?\""]
["13:09,480","13:10,320","\"- It isn't.\""]
["13:10,320","13:11,160","\"- Right, it's not fair enough.\""]
["13:11,160","13:12,880","\"But it's the idea of like, you're trying to present\""]
["13:12,880","13:14,520","\"that she probably just assumed we thought\""]
["13:14,520","13:15,360","\"they were regular.\""]
["13:15,360","13:16,880","\"- You literally meant like, she was like,\""]
["13:16,880","13:18,720","\"you do know they're real, right?\""]
["13:18,720","13:19,560","\"I promise you.\""]
["13:19,560","13:22,700","\"She actually comes over says yes you want those right?\""]
["13:22,700","13:26,840","\"No, they're real. I think I carry is real\""]
["13:26,840","13:33,140","\"You don't have to suspect me. I thought that you were every Digimon has a huge thing on its head\""]
["13:33,140","13:34,720","\"That's not true\""]
["13:34,720","13:39,940","\"That's a rule if if we find a Digimon that breaks through all of every Digimon having a huge thing on its head\""]
["13:39,940","13:45,880","\"Then he's not a real Digimon. Then it's fucking fake. There are a lot of Digimon with things on their heads like\""]
["13:47,160","13:50,040","\"Edmond. He has a head.\""]
["13:50,040","13:51,800","\"Spike in a headmond.\""]
["13:51,800","13:55,560","\"There's probably like a hornmon and it literally just has a horn on its head and that's it.\""]
["13:55,560","13:58,120","\"That sounds like one that is real.\""]
["13:58,120","13:59,400","\"Israel.\""]

["14:06,600","14:07,240","\"These.\""]
["14:07,240","14:07,960","\"That's Israelmon.\""]
["14:07,960","14:09,160","\"That's probably Mon I think.\""]
["14:09,160","14:10,280","\"No, the other one's Pokemon.\""]
["14:10,280","14:11,480","\"It doesn't tell you their name.\""]
["14:11,480","14:12,680","\"Oh, that is right there.\""]
["14:12,680","14:13,240","\"My bad.\""]
["14:13,240","14:15,240","\"I just remember from the anime.\""]
["14:17,080","14:24,780","\"I'm an expert hello. I remember you know a Digimon when they get back from the digital world like halfway through the season\""]
["14:24,780","14:30,520","\"Yeah, or the series and they're in like the real world with their Digimon. Yeah, I remember being so hyped as a kid\""]
["14:30,520","14:32,520","\"When I got away\""]
["14:32,520","14:39,500","\"That's one of the better parts of the story in a noise the shit out of me whenever there's a show like oh\""]
["14:39,500","14:42,240","\"I'm a teenager and I got superpowers\""]
["14:42,800","14:46,360","\"But I can't tell my parents and my teachers might find out I\""]
["14:46,360","14:49,280","\"Know it was a fucking\""]
["14:49,280","14:53,840","\"Exception so that they end up telling their parents about it and it's not a big deal and it was so cool\""]
["14:53,840","14:56,560","\"There's a big black Digimon in the sky. That's coming down through the clouds\""]
["14:56,560","15:03,120","\"And it's really scary when they go back to the real world the first time to the way that they handle the colors and everything that they desaturated a bit\""]
["15:03,120","15:10,680","\"It gets to make it feel really impactful. It was cool. It was neat. I was sad that I really like the Digimon anime compared to like Pokemon\""]
["15:10,960","15:13,760","\"Yeah, no, I was gonna say again everything everybody\""]
["15:13,760","15:18,200","\"Yeah, it seems like Digimon actually had a lot of thought and her put into it\""]
["15:18,200","15:21,260","\"But it's a real shame. We got the worst fucking dub ever\""]
["15:21,260","15:24,360","\"I'm not gonna I'm not gonna bash on it\""]
["15:24,360","15:29,400","\"For changing the tone because I do like what they did, but I do prefer the original\""]
["15:29,400","15:34,080","\"I can appreciate subon levels of cheese, but I can only do so much\""]
["15:35,680","15:37,600","\"It's pretty hard to stomach.\""]
["15:37,600","15:40,880","\"It's written very thoughtfully.\""]
["15:40,880","15:45,080","\"Like each Digimon reflects a personality feature\""]
["15:45,080","15:46,000","\"of each character.\""]
["15:46,000","15:49,160","\"Like you get that sort of impact out of it.\""]
["15:49,160","15:50,000","\"That's cool.\""]
["15:50,000","15:52,040","\"The Digimon movie, it is so sad\""]
["15:52,040","15:54,160","\"what they did to that first OVA.\""]
["15:54,160","15:56,160","\"Yeah, no, because the first one's really cool.\""]
["15:56,160","15:58,880","\"I still love the part where like, you know,\""]
["15:58,880","16:01,040","\"there's the virus, that's my favorite one.\""]
["16:01,040","16:02,200","\"There's the bird.\""]
["16:02,200","16:03,640","\"You can get that bird puns.\""]
["16:03,640","16:05,160","\"You can get that Digimon in this, Chris.\""]
["16:05,160","16:06,360","\"- Is he your actual Digimon?\""]
["16:06,360","16:07,200","\"- Yeah, he is.\""]
["16:07,200","16:08,040","\"- I thought that was just a movie only Digimon.\""]
["16:08,040","16:09,040","\"- No, he's a real Digimon.\""]
["16:09,040","16:09,960","\"- Cool.\""]
["16:09,960","16:12,320","\"- He probably is like from that movie,\""]
["16:12,320","16:13,880","\"but yeah, he's like in Canon.\""]
["16:13,880","16:14,860","\"- Mm.\""]
["16:14,860","16:17,520","\"That went by too fast to say, \"\"I am so a child.\"\"\""]

["16:18,680","16:19,600","\"- I probably should have read it.\""]
["16:19,600","16:20,920","\"- Really?\""]
["16:20,920","16:22,320","\"- I am so a child.\""]
["16:22,320","16:23,480","\"- I mean, that's what we were telling you,\""]
["16:23,480","16:26,680","\"that this translation is not perfect.\""]
["16:26,680","16:28,120","\"- I wonder if they changed it,\""]
["16:28,120","16:28,960","\"'cause this is the--\""]
["16:28,960","16:30,840","\"- Oh, like updated it for the complete version.\""]
["16:30,840","16:32,680","\"- 'Cause yeah, we played the original version\""]
["16:32,680","16:34,960","\"of this way back and...\""]
["16:34,960","16:37,280","\"A lot of weird things with the translation,\""]
["16:37,280","16:39,400","\"not to mention just dialogue trees\""]
["16:39,400","16:41,760","\"kind of breaking sometimes, so selections.\""]
["16:41,760","16:42,760","\"- Whoa, this is cool.\""]
["16:42,760","16:43,600","\"- This is - just countergrants broken hands. - Whoa, this is cool.\""]

["16:44,920","16:45,760","\"- I like it.\""]
["16:45,760","16:46,600","\"- He's got a really cool design design.\""]

["16:48,880","16:50,840","\"All these encounters get to be really cool.\""]
["16:50,840","16:53,440","\"- It feels very like fucking like fifth dimensional.\""]
["16:53,440","16:56,840","\"Like you're like, oh, this thing is like expanding into--\""]
["16:56,840","16:59,440","\"- There's the subway later on.\""]
["16:59,440","17:00,280","\"- Yeah.\""]

["17:03,040","17:05,760","\"We'll see we're not gonna ruin it. I want it\""]
["17:05,760","17:11,280","\"They usually end up getting to do that with a lot of these versions of Digimon that they take it into the real world\""]
["17:11,280","17:17,120","\"And they always get to do fun stuff with it. It always gets to be interesting. We must kill all Digimon\""]

["17:21,920","17:27,800","\"I've seen enough it's not going to fuck it. Oh is it? Thank God\""]

["18:02,320","18:07,180","\"Yeah, I think you would probably do a good job actually handling crash bandic. I think I would too honestly\""]
["18:07,180","18:12,700","\"I'm actually pretty good. I think you figured out how to do that voice and make it work\""]
["18:12,700","18:18,360","\"No, I think rather than him later on good, but he'll be the best. Yeah, that's not crash bandicoot\""]
["18:18,360","18:22,920","\"Yeah, I don't I hate that shit. I think he's funnier when he's like he's actually brain dead really\""]
["18:24,440","18:26,800","\"Like that's always make him sound really good\""]
["18:26,800","18:43,840","\"Anyway, anyway, he's having trouble logging out who's logging out this time daddy. Yeah, he never logs out on time\""]
["18:43,840","18:48,760","\"He forgot to delete his brother. My dad hasn't logged in in years\""]
