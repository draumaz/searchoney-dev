["05:17,280","05:20,900","\"Was gonna say just use ads sharpening stone that would have fixed it\""]
["05:20,900","05:24,780","\"Well, this is just is okay\""]
["05:24,780","05:31,700","\"Better in fact now that it's not broken down halfway not bad\""]

["05:57,540","06:07,600","\"He's filling up this fuck. It's all ooey and gooey. I'm not a fan of the nipples. They're really pissing me off honestly\""]
["06:07,600","06:12,400","\"Yeah, it looks like you can pull on that chain and hurt the fuck. Yeah, why don't I just do that?\""]
["06:12,400","06:14,400","\"Yeah, that should be the real way to defeat him.\""]
["06:14,400","06:16,400","\"Just yank his chain.\""]

["06:30,400","06:33,400","\"It targets his head, which is like...\""]
["06:33,400","06:34,400","\"He did something new there, I think.\""]
["06:34,400","06:38,400","\"Yeah, well, it didn't work, but that was unexpected.\""]
["06:38,400","06:40,400","\"He hasn't hit you once this entire fight, though.\""]
