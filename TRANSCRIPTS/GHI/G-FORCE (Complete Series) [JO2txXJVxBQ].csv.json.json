["[\"32:01,280\",\"32:05,400\",\"\\\"But the reason why the game was shit is because it was being built on a cry engine\\\"\"]"]

["[\"32:24,440\",\"32:29,120\",\"\\\"That was one of them and when they brought it to it. It's like the Cry engine ran like shit on the Wii U\\\"\"]"]

["[\"32:49,220\",\"32:54,640\",\"\\\"Because it just looks like a I don't know a Jack and Daxter clone like a really basic game\\\"\"]"]
