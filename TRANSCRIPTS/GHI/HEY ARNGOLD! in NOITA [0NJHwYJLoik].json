["00:01,720","00:02,940","\"- Melee immunity.\""]
["00:02,940","00:04,320","\"- Revenge rats.\""]
["00:04,320","00:05,800","\"- Freeze Field is the worst thing ever.\""]
["00:05,800","00:07,400","\"Melee immunity's not bad.\""]
["00:07,400","00:08,720","\"- Yeah, take it.\""]
["00:08,720","00:09,560","\"- Mm.\""]
["00:09,560","00:10,920","\"- Or he could reroll.\""]
["00:10,920","00:11,760","\"- Oh, I got it.\""]
["00:11,760","00:12,600","\"- I feel real.\""]
["00:12,600","00:13,440","\"- I feel real that last time.\""]
["00:13,440","00:16,640","\"- He might feel really bad about losing melee immunity.\""]
["00:16,640","00:18,600","\"- Yeah, this is risky.\""]
["00:18,600","00:19,440","\"- This is risky.\""]
["00:19,440","00:21,040","\"- But Chris likes a good risk.\""]
["00:21,040","00:22,400","\"(dramatic music)\""]
["00:22,400","00:23,240","\"- Oh shit.\""]
["00:23,240","00:24,080","\"(laughing)\""]
["00:24,080","00:25,880","\"- I'll do the teleporitis dodge though.\""]
["00:25,880","00:26,720","\"That's not fast.\""]
["00:26,720","00:27,560","\"- What is so bad?\""]
["00:27,560","00:29,240","\"- Does that mean you automatically teleport\""]
["00:29,240","00:30,240","\"you take damage?\""]
["00:30,240","00:31,240","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:31,240","00:32,240","\"It's not that bad.\""]
["00:32,240","00:33,240","\"I'm gonna do...\""]
["00:33,240","00:39,480","\"I guess it can prevent you from getting like, cheesed by a gas or something.\""]
["00:39,480","00:40,480","\"Yeah.\""]
["00:40,480","00:45,040","\"Or accidentally throw you into a gas and kill you instantly, you know, one or the other.\""]
["00:45,040","00:46,240","\"I always like the shotgun.\""]
["00:46,240","00:47,240","\"It's really handy.\""]
["00:47,240","00:48,240","\"You can just do that.\""]
["00:48,240","00:49,240","\"Yummy gold.\""]
["00:49,240","00:52,240","\"Oh, I have invisible force pulling you.\""]
["00:52,240","00:54,720","\"What's that you're talking about?\""]
["00:54,720","00:57,960","\"One can say this is the most radical game.\""]
["00:57,960","01:07,120","\"radical game. I would agree. Oops. Oopsie. I got five of that. Okay. Oh, there's a bunch\""]
["01:07,120","01:12,400","\"of weird force fields in here. That must have been what that message about the strange force\""]
["01:12,400","01:19,040","\"pulling you. It fucks with your bullets. See that? Yeah. It's pushing them outward. Jesus.\""]
["01:19,040","01:23,680","\"And Chris of Arnold from Hey Arnold came to your house because I know you like him. First\""]
["01:23,680","01:25,880","\"of all I puke because his face is really really nice.\""]
["01:25,880","01:28,680","\"Yeah, but you want to be his friend, right?\""]
["01:28,680","01:30,680","\"Yeah, you know, he seems like a really nice guy.\""]
["01:30,680","01:34,920","\"So let's say Arnold from Hey Arnold shows up and he brings a block of gold and he says\""]
["01:34,920","01:35,920","\"there's no rush on this.\""]
["01:35,920","01:37,760","\"There's no time limit.\""]
["01:37,760","01:41,680","\"But if you want to be my friend, I have to see that you're making a good effort to eat\""]
["01:41,680","01:43,280","\"this whole block of gold just.\""]
["01:43,280","01:44,280","\"Oh, I wouldn't.\""]
["01:44,280","01:45,280","\"Yeah.\""]
["01:45,280","01:48,240","\"Why is Hey Arnold of all people making Chrissy?\""]
["01:48,240","01:53,480","\"No, because he's like he just wants to, you know, know that his request is being respected\""]
["01:53,480","01:57,200","\"and that he's at least making an honest effort to eat his life to the block.\""]
["01:57,200","01:58,200","\"- But why do you want your block to go?\""]
["01:58,200","01:59,200","\"- Is it coming from?\""]
["01:59,200","02:02,880","\"- Like on Instagram, you know, they have like the gold leaf pizzas or like the gold leaf\""]
["02:02,880","02:04,480","\"burgers or like the ice cream.\""]
["02:04,480","02:05,480","\"- Oh, but a full block?\""]
["02:05,480","02:08,960","\"- Yeah, but he's giving it to you, like free of charge, but you know--\""]
["02:08,960","02:09,960","\"- That's like 70,000 dollars.\""]
["02:09,960","02:10,960","\"- Yeah, what's the street value of this block of gold?\""]
["02:10,960","02:11,960","\"- I don't know if you sell it.\""]
["02:11,960","02:17,760","\"- No, but just on principle, what would the street value be?\""]
["02:17,760","02:19,760","\"- Probably a lot of people would.\""]
["02:19,760","02:20,760","\"- Yeah, I would.\""]
["02:20,760","02:21,760","\"- Yeah, I would.\""]
["02:21,760","02:24,080","\"- Street value B. - Probably a lot.\""]
["02:24,080","02:24,920","\"- Yeah. - I don't know\""]
["02:24,920","02:26,360","\"the fucking value of it. - Like is it worth\""]
["02:26,360","02:27,640","\"more than Arnold's friendship?\""]
["02:27,640","02:28,880","\"Is this the real question?\""]
["02:28,880","02:30,800","\"- Yes, I don't really care about him that much.\""]
["02:30,800","02:33,080","\"- So you'd sell the gold instead of making\""]
["02:33,080","02:34,720","\"an honest attempt to eat it.\""]
["02:34,720","02:36,760","\"- Actually, I'd be like,\""]
["02:36,760","02:38,640","\"I'd probably be like, dude, just letting you know,\""]
["02:38,640","02:41,080","\"if you give me this gold, I'm probably not gonna eat it.\""]
["02:41,080","02:42,560","\"So maybe you should get someone else to eat it\""]
["02:42,560","02:43,440","\"'cause I will probably sell it.\""]
["02:43,440","02:45,080","\"I'm not gonna waste it.\""]
["02:45,080","02:46,440","\"- What if he just looked at the floor?\""]
["02:46,440","02:48,120","\"- Yeah, what if he appreciated Chris's honesty\""]
["02:48,120","02:49,960","\"and let him keep the gold anyway?\""]
["02:49,960","02:51,200","\"- That was a test.\""]
["02:51,200","02:54,900","\"and you're just stupid and you're in the shape.\""]
["02:54,900","02:57,920","\"- So it wouldn't have been the character you thought he was.\""]
["02:57,920","02:59,680","\"- It'd be like this is what your parents abandoned you.\""]
["02:59,680","03:02,600","\"- Do you think that that's like fundamentally opposed\""]
["03:02,600","03:05,080","\"to Arnold's character to request that you eat gold?\""]
["03:05,080","03:06,040","\"- I think so.\""]
["03:06,040","03:06,880","\"I don't think that's--\""]
["03:06,880","03:07,960","\"- He's a smart kid, dude.\""]
["03:07,960","03:09,800","\"- I think if Arnold had that gold,\""]
["03:09,800","03:11,640","\"he would do something, he would like help,\""]
["03:11,640","03:13,880","\"like he'd help the homeless or something.\""]
["03:13,880","03:15,920","\"- Yeah, but if he's not, you've got to assume\""]
["03:15,920","03:18,640","\"that he's got a good reason for wanting you to eat it.\""]
["03:18,640","03:19,640","\"- Nope.\""]
["03:19,640","03:22,000","\"What if it's like those, you ever seen that thing\""]
["03:22,000","03:24,680","\"where there's like those squirrels or those cats\""]
["03:24,680","03:28,880","\"in like Peru and they eat coffee beans\""]
["03:28,880","03:30,760","\"and then the coffee beans that they shit out\""]
["03:30,760","03:33,120","\"are completely sweet and not bitter.\""]
["03:33,120","03:34,920","\"So they take that and they put that in a bag\""]
["03:34,920","03:36,280","\"and they make coffee out of it?\""]
["03:36,280","03:38,400","\"- No, I have heard of that.\""]
["03:38,400","03:39,400","\"- Yeah, it's kind of cute though.\""]
["03:39,400","03:42,040","\"- But what if Arnold kind of wants to do a situation\""]
["03:42,040","03:43,440","\"like that but with helping people,\""]
["03:43,440","03:46,840","\"he figures the gold is better if Chris eats it\""]
["03:46,840","03:48,840","\"and then shits it out, dispersed over.\""]
["03:48,840","03:51,640","\"- So I don't know that's not only that you eat the gold,\""]
["03:51,640","03:54,120","\"but that you collect your shit after it's four.\""]
["03:54,120","03:55,400","\"- I don't think he expects you to do it.\""]
["03:55,400","03:58,360","\"I think the implication there is that that would be taken care\""]
["03:58,360","03:59,760","\"of, all you have to do is.\""]
["03:59,760","04:03,800","\"- So just by your gold shit getting into the sewage system,\""]
["04:03,800","04:05,920","\"you'd be somehow helping the world?\""]
["04:05,920","04:07,000","\"- Yeah, but he didn't--\""]
["04:07,000","04:09,520","\"- This is a contrite plan Arnold has.\""]
["04:09,520","04:13,040","\"- He implies that, but he doesn't outright say it.\""]
["04:13,040","04:14,640","\"- It's just implied.\""]
["04:14,640","04:17,160","\"- Yeah, you kind of have to trust Arnold.\""]
["04:17,160","04:18,000","\"- I don't trust him.\""]
["04:18,000","04:20,800","\"You don't know how many episodes of you watch.\""]
["04:20,800","04:21,640","\"- And that was the truth, so.\""]
["04:21,640","04:23,520","\"- Okay, you're genuinely asking, like,\""]
["04:23,520","04:25,960","\"knowing him from watching the show.\""]
["04:25,960","04:28,960","\"Yeah, he seems pretty trustworthy.\""]
["04:28,960","04:30,200","\"He does, no, you're right.\""]
["04:30,200","04:32,320","\"He seems like he's almost a merry suit.\""]
["04:32,320","04:34,840","\"In fact, he is just a merry suit, kind of.\""]
["04:34,840","04:36,480","\"But isn't that like the end of the movie\""]
["04:36,480","04:38,920","\"as grandpa says trashed in Arnold\""]
["04:38,920","04:42,800","\"and they all join hands and it makes Arnold stronger?\""]
["04:42,800","04:44,360","\"I do remember that, yeah.\""]
["04:44,360","04:45,200","\"Oh, fuck.\""]
["04:46,040","04:48,520","\"See? Maybe that's how he gets the gold.\""]
["04:48,520","04:49,520","\"Oh fuck.\""]
["04:49,520","04:51,360","\"No, no, no.\""]
["04:51,360","04:52,360","\"No!\""]
["04:52,360","04:54,360","\"No, no, no. Oh my god, dude. Really?\""]
["04:54,360","04:56,000","\"Jesus.\""]
["04:56,000","04:58,400","\"That warp is actually not bad.\""]
["04:58,400","04:59,400","\"Yeah.\""]
["04:59,400","05:01,400","\"It saved me a few times already.\""]
["05:01,400","05:03,400","\"Yeah, it's worth its weight and...\""]
["05:03,400","05:05,400","\"Oh no.\""]
["05:05,400","05:07,880","\"It's worth its waste and weight and Arnold gold.\""]
["05:07,880","05:09,880","\"Yeah, I didn't want to say it.\""]
["05:09,880","05:10,880","\"Oh shit.\""]
["05:10,880","05:11,880","\"Fuck up.\""]
["05:11,880","05:13,620","\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\""]
["05:13,620","05:15,520","\"(mimics gun buzzer)\""]
["05:15,520","05:16,360","\"- Gold.\""]
["05:16,360","05:22,440","\"- Oh, you're stupid to steal the gold.\""]
["05:22,440","05:23,340","\"(laughs)\""]
["05:23,340","05:25,020","\"- Hella good gee, patsyucky.\""]
["05:25,020","05:26,220","\"Oh, wow, look at that.\""]
["05:26,220","05:29,500","\"Was her middle initial really gee?\""]
["05:29,500","05:31,060","\"- Yeah. - So, I didn't.\""]
["05:31,060","05:32,820","\"- Like, alley gee. - Like alley gee.\""]
["05:32,820","05:33,980","\"- Yeah, she's related.\""]
["05:33,980","05:35,020","\"Fuck, there was a wand there.\""]
["05:35,020","05:35,940","\"I missed it.\""]
["05:35,940","05:38,740","\"It was just a bad wand anyway.\""]
["05:38,740","05:40,080","\"- Yeah, probably wouldn't have been good.\""]
["05:40,080","05:42,680","\"Those grapes were sour anyway.\""]
["05:42,680","05:44,720","\"- He's talking about that.\""]
["05:44,720","05:47,120","\"- That's where the expression sour grapes comes from.\""]
["05:47,120","05:50,880","\"It's like the wolf who cried sour grapes.\""]
["05:50,880","05:53,240","\"- Tinkler's wants the worst who cried sour grapes.\""]
["05:53,240","05:55,000","\"- I think that really is the story\""]
["05:55,000","05:57,080","\"that originates the term sour grapes.\""]
["05:57,080","05:58,040","\"- It's something like that.\""]
["05:58,040","05:59,680","\"- It's like about like a wolf who's trying\""]
["05:59,680","06:03,160","\"to get grapes out of some bush or whatever.\""]
["06:03,160","06:05,400","\"And he can't get them and then he's just like,\""]
["06:05,400","06:06,920","\"and then he just convinces himself\""]
["06:06,920","06:08,720","\"that the grapes were sour anyway.\""]
["06:08,720","06:09,720","\"- I thought that the--\""]
["06:09,720","06:14,160","\"The bartender says if you come back asking for grapes, I'll nail your feet to the floor.\""]
["06:14,160","06:15,480","\"I thought that was the duck.\""]
["06:15,480","06:19,560","\"And then the wolf comes back and he says, \"\"God any nails?\"\" and the bartender says, \"\"No.\"\"\""]
["06:19,560","06:21,480","\"And then he says, \"\"God any grapes?\"\"\""]
["06:21,480","06:23,960","\"That is the joke, but wait a minute.\""]
["06:23,960","06:25,680","\"It's not a joke, it's a fucking...\""]

["06:31,720","06:33,120","\"Fuck you, you can't come in.\""]
["06:33,120","06:34,120","\"Yeah, it wasn't helping.\""]
["06:34,120","06:36,600","\"Oh no, sorry, it wasn't a wolf, it was a fox.\""]
["06:36,600","06:37,600","\"It's an ASAP fable.\""]
["06:37,600","06:38,600","\"I hate so.\""]
["06:38,600","06:42,040","\"Hey, so I've had some funny ideas about how animals work.\""]
["06:42,040","06:43,240","\"Jesus dude, look at this shit.\""]
["06:43,240","06:44,680","\"That is not helping you.\""]
["06:44,680","06:45,680","\"Why are you doing that?\""]

["06:49,680","06:50,520","\"What is that?\""]
["06:50,520","06:51,680","\"It's just dirt.\""]
["06:51,680","06:53,880","\"Why are you leaking dirt?\""]
["06:53,880","06:55,640","\"It saved me from all these guys spilling in.\""]
["06:55,640","06:56,760","\"So you did it on purpose.\""]
["06:56,760","06:57,600","\"Yeah.\""]
["06:57,600","06:59,280","\"Okay, I thought that was something\""]
["06:59,280","07:00,440","\"that you didn't have control over\""]
["07:00,440","07:02,720","\"and you were just leaking dirt.\""]
["07:02,720","07:04,000","\"I'm not that silly.\""]
["07:04,000","07:04,840","\"Silly-nilly.\""]
["07:04,840","07:06,280","\"You were in the driver's seat the whole time.\""]
